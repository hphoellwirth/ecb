Date,President,Text
07/12/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today’s meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. Today’s decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. After today’s increase, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative, with the key ECB interest rates remaining at low levels, money and credit growth strong, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. The Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Turning first to the economic analysis, according to Eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real GDP in the euro area for the third quarter of 2006 was 0.5%. The data thus confirm our assessment that economic activity continued to expand robustly, while moderating from the very strong rates seen in the first half of the year. Domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth in the third quarter, confirming the anticipated broadening of the recovery and pointing to the increasingly self-sustaining nature of economic expansion in the euro area. The information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued in the fourth quarter of this year. Looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential. While some volatility in the quarterly growth rates is likely to emerge around the turn of the year, associated with the impact of changes in indirect taxes in a large euro area country, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. As regards the external environment, economic growth has become more balanced across regions. Helped in part by lower oil prices, global growth is robust, thereby providing support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. This outlook is also reflected in the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.5% and 2.9% in 2006, between 1.7% and 2.7% in 2007 and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture. In comparison with the September ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2006 and 2007 have been revised upwards, largely reflecting the assumption of lower energy prices and their impact on real disposable income. In the Governing Council’s view, the risks surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic growth over the projection horizon lie on the downside. The main risks relate to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks, and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation rose to 1.8% in November 2006, from 1.6% in October and 1.7% in September. While no detailed breakdown of the November HICP data is available as of yet, the lower annual HICP inflation rates recorded in the two previous months reflected mainly the significant declines in crude oil prices from August onwards, as well as base effects. While the outlook for energy prices remains uncertain, on the basis of the oil prices currently implied by the futures market overall inflation rates are likely to increase again in early 2007 and then hover around 2% in the course of that year, also reflecting the impact of higher indirect taxes. The December Eurosystem staff projections see annual HICP inflation at between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2006, between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2007 and between 1.3% and 2.5% in 2008. Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture. Compared with the September 2006 ECB staff projections, the ranges for 2006 and 2007 are somewhat lower, largely reflecting the assumption of lower energy prices. In this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including market expectations for short and long-term interest rates as well as for oil and non-energy commodity prices. In the Governing Council’s view, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks, stemming in particular from a pass-through of previous oil price increases which is stronger than assumed in the baseline scenario, the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, wage developments could be stronger than currently expected. Therefore, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Wage agreements should take into account productivity developments in connection with the still high level of unemployment and positions in price competitiveness. It is also important that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms. Turning to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth was unchanged at 8.5% in October, remaining close to the highest rates observed since the introduction of the euro, which points to inflationary risks at medium to longer horizons. Increasing interest rates have exerted some influence over monetary developments in recent months, although as yet mainly by triggering shifts among the components of M3 rather than constraining the expansion of M3 itself. In particular, the annual growth rate of M1 has moderated somewhat, reflecting shifts from overnight deposits into other components of M3 which offer more market-related returns. More generally, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the low level of interest rates and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. In particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, their dynamism remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. In the context of rising interest rates, the growth of household borrowing has shown signs of stabilisation in recent months, albeit at very high growth rates. By contrast, the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards and has now reached rates of over 12% on an annual basis, the highest seen since the early 1990s. Thus, when the counterparts of M3 are considered, the main driver of strong monetary growth remains the expansion of credit to the private sector. Taking a medium to longer-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ECB’s monetary analysis since mid-2004. Furthermore, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% in the coming two years, with risks to this outlook remaining on the upside. In addition, given the ongoing marked dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to long term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. The Governing Council will therefore monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. As regards fiscal policy, the European Commission’s autumn forecasts suggest that deficits will fall below 3% of GDP in most euro area countries by 2007. This is welcome. However, the projected improvements in fiscal balances can only partly be attributed to substantial progress in structural consolidation, as higher economic growth and revenue windfalls are playing an important role. Moreover, in a number of countries with fiscal imbalances, adjustment efforts still fall short of what is needed to meet their respective medium-term objectives in a timely manner and thus fulfil the requirements of the revised Stability and Growth Pact. This is of major concern. It is therefore crucial that forthcoming updates of the stability programmes not only envisage significant progress towards the correction of excessive deficits in a sustainable manner but also make sufficient headway towards safe budgetary positions in the countries concerned. For all countries it is paramount that pro-cyclical policies be avoided in the current economic upswing. More progress is also needed with fiscal structural reform as part of a comprehensive medium-term strategy to improve economic incentives and the soundness of social security systems. This would be a crucial contribution of fiscal policies to economic growth and fiscal sustainability as well as to confidence in the revised Stability and Growth Pact. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomed the 2006 progress reports submitted by EU Member States on their 2005-08 national reform programmes, in line with the renewed Lisbon Strategy. Although it is encouraging that many concrete reform steps are being taken or are planned, there is still a considerable way to go to make the euro area a more dynamic economy, which is crucial to meeting the challenges of globalisation, population ageing and rapid technological change. Reform measures should foster more integrated, flexible and competitive economies in the euro area, thus allowing more efficient adjustment processes and a stronger resilience to shocks. These are essential conditions for the substantial benefits of the single currency to be better exploited and for the economic performance to improve in both the euro area as a whole and in each member state. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * On your first question, I would say we do not have two needles in our compass, we have one. We are not arbitrating between the risks of inflation and the risks for growth. We take growth into account to the extent that it augments or diminishes the risks of inflation – an inflation which would not be in line with our definition of price stability. So I was very clear on the risks for growth, which we see as being on the downside. The projections themselves are made by our Eurosystem staff and under their responsibility. We ourselves exercise judgement on this input as well as on a number of other inputs. I made that point very clearly and you know that this is our position. So, as regards our own assessment on inflation, we are here to ensure price stability, deliver price stability and be credible in that delivery over time in line with our definition of price stability. It is as simple as that, there is no ambiguity regarding our own monetary policy concept. As regards your second question, the sentences I use speak for themselves. I could repeat it if you wish: “after today’s increase, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative with the key ECB interest rates remaining at low levels”. I also said, “therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted”. And I concluded, we “will monitor very closely all developments” in risks to price stability. I will not comment on any particular meaning that the last sentence might have but it has no other meaning besides what it says: “the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments”. And as you know our permanent posture, our reference posture, is that we are constantly alert, we look at developments and data, we embark on deep analyses and we make our judgement to take the decision when we judge that it is necessary to act to deliver price stability and be credible in the delivery of price stability. I have already said in the introductory that this permits – and is the only way to permit – the anchoring of inflationary expectations in the medium and long term – and even in the very long term. I was checking the present level of fifty-year rates in the euro area, which are around 3.85%. These rates are incorporating our credibility in delivering, over the next fifty years, inflation in line with the definition of price stability of less than 2% but close to 2%. Of course, there are other elements which can explain this very low level, but the anchoring of inflation expectations is one of the elements that explain this level. As regards you last question on wages I think it is a risk which we do consider to be on the upside. Again, there is no materialisation as yet of this risk at the level of the euro area as a whole. But our message today is particularly clear on that point because we think that there are temptations which in our view would not be appropriate. We trust, for reasons that I have explained, particularly the level of unemployment and the need to maintain price stability, that social partners have to be responsible in that area. So, yes, there is a message there that the risks in that area might be on the upside and, as you know, once the risks have materialised, it is too late. On the first point, again, what I said speaks for itself. I said: “Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted.” I said also that we would monitor developments “very closely”, I stick to that. On the second point, yes, we were unanimous. On the third point, it is clear that we have an element of dynamism in the counterparts to the monetary aggregates M3, which is very impressive as I have already told you that on these occasions. But again it is good to go to the figures themselves. When I look at the loans to the non-financial corporate sector, if I go a little bit back, in August we were at 12%, in September at 12.7%, in October at 12.9%. So for a number of very complex reasons, the growth of loans to the non-financial corporate sector, which is an important segment of the private sector, is very dynamic and has to be carefully considered. It is approximately 2.5 times the growth of the GDP in value terms. Our monetary analysis concentrates on the aggregate itself and the components, and we try to understand exactly what is happening. We have M1, which is decelerating as expected since we have been increasing rates starting in December last year, now altogether by 150 basis points. Offsetting this diminishing growth rate of M1, you have M3 minus M1 which continues to be dynamic. So you have a large shift between the components of M3. And the overall result is that the M3 remains very dynamic. It would be a wrong interpretation. Again, we have to be as clear as possible: that particular interpretation would not be correct. What is correct is that, as always, we reserve the possibility to act any time, as I said, we do not pre-commit for two, three, four, five, six months later. But we can, and I have always said that, take the decision which is appropriate, taking into account the conditions in which we would be and the absolute necessity to deliver price stability and be credible in that delivery. We do not say that. I did not mention that, and on the exchange rates, which are, as you know, a very important issue, my terms of reference are very simple. I stick to what, on behalf of the Governing Council, I have signed a few sentences with the colleagues of the G7, including the sentence “Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth.” As I have always said, our position – which has been our position since the very beginning of the euro, and is the firm position of the ECB – is that we do not encourage the use of the euro. We let the operators, markets participants, investors and savers judge the various financial and monetary instruments – tradable or not – and it is up to them to make their judgements. We do not encourage the international use of the euro. On the first question, I would say that, for us, things are very clear. The market, yourselves, all observers, savers and market participants the world over know our monetary policy concept. They know that we are committed to delivering price stability. They know our arithmetic definition of price stability. This is not necessarily the case elsewhere, as you know, but we have full transparency in our own monetary policy concept and in our definition of price stability. Everybody could see what we did in the past and make a judgement. The new information, the data, are fully open, everybody has access to all the data. Our contribution is the judgement we make on the basis of a deep analysis of all the facts. But this is also done by the markets. The markets have all the information and can draw the appropriate conclusions from that information. I will not comment further. Of course, I know that we influence them through our own decisions, but it is their responsibility to match their judgement on the basis of all the information. And as you know better than anybody, not all market people have the same opinion. I am very interested to see the wide range of opinions existing at the level of major financial institutions. I believe that in your articles, editorials and judgement, you also have a wide range of views. I have nothing to add to that. As regards the euro, I stick to what I said before: “excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth”. As regards the VAT increase, it has been known for a very long period of time, so we incorporated the VAT decision in our analysis as well as in our projections a long time ago. There is nothing new there. What is unknown, obviously, is exactly the impact it will have; the part of it which will be cushioned by some diminution of margins, the part of it which materialise in the prices. We will see. But there is presently a mainstream analysis and we do not depart from it. When I mention the risks of further inflation that would be due to indirect taxes or administrative taxes, I am not thinking about VAT. I am thinking about what would or could come in all countries in Europe on top of what has already been decided and taken into account today. And I have to say, when I look at the past, the annual level of the impact of these public decisions on annual inflation – yearly price increases – has been significant, year after year, for reasons that are very complex. As regards the changes in the risks concerning inflation, I mentioned traditional risks but, in the case of wages, we have the sentiment that we have to be particularly attentive to this element of risk. Even if those risks did not materialise, but when they materialise– it is too late. I would first like to say that we are all delighted that Slovenia is joining the euro area as soon as January next year. I am delighted myself to be going to Slovenia at the invitation of the Government and the central bank. It is very impressive to think that there will be 13 of us; that thanks to Slovenia there will be 315 million citizens in the euro area. As a comparison, the United States has 300 million citizens – so the populations are really of the same order of magnitude and it is impressive. It also shows that we are not a closed shop but an open area, provided of course that the Maastricht criteria are met – and they were met in the case of Slovenia. And that is the reason why we, as well as the European Commission, recommended the acceptance of the entry of Slovenia. As you know Governor Gaspari of the Bank of Slovenia has already joined us as an observer since the decision on Slovenia was taken. He also attended our meeting today and we are delighted to be able to welcome him soon as full member of the Governing Council I would say first of all that, the fact that you share a solid currency, a currency which maintains price stability, means a number of consequences on the fiscal side. With entry to the euro area the Stability and Growth Pact changes in nature, because there are sanctions for behaviour which is not in line with the overall superior interest of the euro area as a whole, while there are no sanctions associated with so-called “bad behaviour” when you are outside the euro area. This is an important change. Also having the single currency you have to pay special attention to the unit labour cost – the competitiveness indicators in general – because there is no way to reconstruct competitiveness through realignment, so you have to constantly keep an eye on competitiveness. These are my two main messages. Speaking of Slovenia let me mention a point which we have made already. In a single currency area, which is a single market with a single currency, absolute free circulation of men, women, capital, goods and services is of the essence. A real single market is necessary for the appropriate functioning of the area. It is abnormal that there are labour restrictions as regards Slovenian workers in a number of economies that are members of the euro area. I have already made that point, and I repeat it: it is not normal in a single currency area; it is contrary to good economics to keep these barriers. As regards the US economy, I would say that it gives new signals regularly. In the same week you may have a number of signals. There is an immediate market interpretation in one direction or another of each of these various signals. But all things being taken into account, I very much share the present views of the Federal Reserve System: I think that we are observing a smooth slowdown and we will very likely continue to observe it. So that is my synthetic assessment of what is going on. As regards the exchange rate, I have already said what I have to say. Concerning your third question, the ranges in our Eurosystem staff projections, as you see, are obviously quite large, not for 2006 but for 2007 and 2008, both for growth and for inflation. They capture uncertainties very well and there are a great number of uncertainties. My view, which is the view of the Governing Council and also a global view, is that in general we are in a period which is very favourable at a global level, and extremely flattering in terms of successive years of very robust growth. At the same time the uncertainties are probably more acute. So you have both: continued exceptional prosperity and more uncertainty at a global level. We have to take all that into account. We are speaking of risks. We think that there are more upside than downside risks for price stability. But I think it would be wrong to conclude that the implicit real number within the range is this or that, because we are speaking of risks and not already of materialisation of risks. It is an important question, but it is a question that has already been asked, discussed, reflected upon and resolved. So, I am referring to the past. Whatever pros and cons may have been put forward as arguments, the conclusion of the European Commission, the ECB and the European Council was that we had a Treaty and that we had to stick to the Treaty. And everybody knows what it is like to change the Treaty. We live in states that respect laws and the Treaties as they stand. In respecting the Treaty we had the same conclusions as the Commission, and this was accepted by the Council. It has been discussed even at the level of the European Council. Whatever the remarks made, but I will not discuss them – the conclusion was that we had to apply the Treaty as it stands. When making a judgement on growth, you can see that all institutions are predicting growth for next year that would obviously be quite flattering. The European Commission, the IMF and the OECD predict growth in the euro area at 2% or more. In our Eurosystem staff projections we have a large range which has been revised upwards. So, we are living in a euro area with quite robust growth and this is gratifying. Allow me to draw your attention to the press conference we held here in December last year, exactly one year ago. We increased rates in December last year. Since December last year we have increased our rates six times. At the time, there were a number of observers, economists and international institutions that had not all understood our decision – I would dare to say that there were some who questioned whether our judgement was good. Since then, you will note that we have been totally vindicated. Everybody has recognized that we were right in doing what we did in December last year and that we were right in doing what we have done since then. The very same economists, observers, international institutions are now all thinking, that we had a good judgement and that we analysed the situation correctly. I would mention this en passant. To go back to your remark when I speak of downside risks to growth, I am referring to the general downside risks that I have listed, namely the pressures of protectionism, the risk of further increases in the prices of oil and commodities – let us not forget that there are also all other commodities – and also other global threats that could hamper growth in the euro area, but I would not refer particularly to the Italian decision. Thank you for your question. It is a technical question but a very good question. No, it is not an instrument that we have because we are remunerating these reserves. So it is not a present instrument of our monetary policy. I have already responded to the last question and I do not want to bore the journalists here by re-reading what I have already said or by stating it again. Let me only tell you, to sum up, that we are constantly alert and we will do everything that is necessary at any time to ensure price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. That is essential for the prosperity of the euro area as well as a product of our being faithful to our mandate because we have a primary mandate and that mandate is very clear. On the yen, I have nothing to add to or withdraw from what I already said in Singapore. And on the US dollar, I have already expressed myself. As regards your question on the pressure from some euro zone governments I have no comment. First of all, to my knowledge, the preparation has been absolutely excellent. The central bank, the administration and the government had done a great job, a remarkable job. It seems to me that it has been an exemplary cooperation with us in particular and with the other European institutions to pave the way for the best transition possible. As I told you, I will be in Slovenia myself, together with colleagues and other responsible persons from the euro area, and I expect that we will of course have opportunities to deliver messages on this occasion. At this stage, I would say that we are all very happy, joyful as I said, and I think that you can be proud because you did what you wanted to do and you demonstrated that you had met the criteria through hard, successful and fruitful work, so bravo! On the first point, financial stability is one of the responsibilities of central banks. It is something which is extremely important at the level of the euro area. It is a responsibility of the euro system, we pay great attention to it and the Vice-President, in particular, is extraordinarily active in this domain. We have the Financial Stability Forum at a global level, which is also of extreme importance; financial stability is one of the issues that we always examine in the G10, when we are in Basel. So all that I can tell you is that in that domain, we believe that permanent alertness is absolutely essential. Of course, we consider that monetary stability is part of financial stability, it is a necessary condition for financial stability. It is not a sufficient condition per se, because there are permanent changes in the structure of the markets, in the substance of financial instruments, in the imagination and creativity of market participants. What we have been observing over the last years is tremendously stimulating for reflection; we see the hedge funds explosion, we see the derivatives explosion, we see major structural changes in several markets. Let’s say that it is work in progress, and we have to be sure that we can handle the permanent changes that we are observing, and we have to have a view based on a synthesis. That is the reason why in the Financial Stability Forum you have the central banks, the surveillance authorities, both on the banking side, on the insurance side, on the SEC, stock markets side. You also have the governments, the financial institutions and other partners. To conclude on that we have the sentiment at a global level; it is true of course in each particular vast economy like the US or us, or the UK or others, that there is presently some under-appreciation of risks in general. The issue is disputed, you have several schools, but there is a broad agreement that this under-appreciation of risks cannot last forever, and that we have to pave the way for an orderly adjustment of this situation at the global level, which might explain why real rates are low, spreads are low, insurance premia are low, volatility is relatively low, all this in historical terms, of course. As regards your second question, I would only say that Jean-Claude Juncker is a more than excellent president of the Eurogroup and that the Eurogroup is a very important, informal institution. The group has an enormous responsibility given that you have governments that are sharing the same currency, are in a single market with a single currency and are making up a set of 13 economies now, with 315 million people. They share a destiny in common – more, much more than is presently perceived. And so the responsibilities at stake are important and, again, it is important that the group functions well under an excellent chairmanship. I said in the introductory remarks that the two domains where we see an impact of our interest rate increases are, first, on the component analysis of M3: M1 decelerates and is less dynamic, and, second, some credits that are slightly slowing down. There we see an impact, but as I have already said, M3 minus M1 is very dynamic, and there are a number of reasons for that. On the other hand, the credit growth to the non-financial corporate sector in particular is very dynamic, so you have a mutual offsetting, and that explains why M3 itself remains unchanged at the present level. We are working a lot on that, we try to understand exactly what is behind it. As you know, our monetary analysis does not consist in looking at one monetary aggregate and conclude definitively from that. We analyse components and counterparts, work on the dynamics of the aggregates, it is work in progress. As for the IMF, OECD and other international institutions, I do not comment at all on their figures, if any. What I know and said is that these institutions are fully vindicating what we have done before and what we are doing today. Because do not forget that today we increased rates! As regards the yen, I said I have nothing to add or to withdraw from what I said in Singapore. No, I will say nothing on February, absolutely nothing. I said myself it is data–dependent. Not only data of course: data plus deep analysis plus judgement are making up our decision. We are always “conditional” but that does not mean that we do not extract the trend from the data. For instance, when we increased rates in December last year, the data of the last quarter of last year were not that good, but we had the sentiment, which proved to be pertinent and well-founded, that the trend which was underlying was relatively dynamic. It appeared to be even more dynamic than all observers would think. Again, there is no contradiction. And I fully confirm we are conditional, we are depending on data, deep analysis and judgement. But we extract the medium-term trend. At this stage our sentiment is that it is too early to say that we see sufficient accumulation of structural reforms to conclude that we have a significant change in the growth potential of Europe. I know that there are more optimistic schools that are thinking that we can see now the results of previous structural reforms and I do not dispute that it could be argued. But we have only very few data that are showing an increase in labour productivity progress. Let us see and wait a little bit to analyse that as closely as possible, see what is cyclical and what is structural in the recent evolutions. At this stage, I would say we do not change our sentiment on the underlying potential. And when I say that we are hovering over potential, it is the same potential, we do not change it. But we expect of course that the active pursuit of structural reforms, if they continue to be implemented as actively as possible, will permit us to have a better position as regards labour productivity and then, by way of consequence, as regards the growth potential. On the projections, you know it is a question which has a clear-cut response. It is important that every quarter we have projections that are made by staff under their own responsibility, either by our own staff at the ECB or by the full Eurosystem staff. There is a lot of information in such projections, which capture the modelling by our staff, the understanding of the interplay and interaction between all variables, and an element of judgement by staff. It is their responsibility, we do not underwrite these projections. It remains, of course, that it is done by our own staff. It has the credibility and the legitimacy of our own staff in the eyes of external observers. But our monetary policy concept is not an inflation-targeting concept where it is the monetary policy council itself that makes, after a lot of good work done by staff, the monetary policy projections. So again, there is a difference of nature which is very well-known. We take these Eurosystem staff projections as an important information, we consider it, then we make our own judgement and we take our decision. As regards labour productivity, we believe that the labour productivity increases that we are aiming for depend on the dynamism of the private sector and on a number of phenomena that are very complex. We saw this in the United States, because the significant increase in labour productivity progress materialised a long time after the piling-up of investment in communication and computer technology. At the time you had what the great economist Solow qualified as a paradox. The Solow paradox was: we have a lot of investment in IT, but we do not see the productivity improvement. So why is all this investment being made if it does not produce the productivity improvement it is supposed to achieve? Then, after a long period of maturation, in 1995-96 we saw the end of the paradox, because we could see a significant change in labour productivity increases. That being said, we strongly believe that a very important factor in making productivity progress materialise is the flexibility of the economy. The flexibility of markets, of all markets, goods and services, flexibility of the labour market, and overall flexibility of the economy, including full integration of the financial services. And that is the reason why we are so determined to take any occasion to say: let’s embark resolutely on structural reform, let’s complete the Single Market, let’s have an integration of financial markets which would be as complete as possible, let’s let the workers of Slovenia go to the rest of the euro area… On the first question, I must say I did not see the message that you mentioned. I will look carefully at this message… As regards the so-called neutral rate, we do not guide our policy on the basis of neutral rates, we do not guide our policy on the basis of the output gap, we do not guide our policy on the basis of the NAIRU. It is not the way we operate. We embark on a large array of analyses and we do not exclude any concept but we do not take our decision on that basis. We take our decision on the basis of our risk analysis of threats to price stability on the medium run, and we decide accordingly to counter those risks in order to deliver price stability and be credible in this delivery over time on the medium, long and very long term. Thank you very much. "
02/11/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by Mr Heinäluoma, President of the Ecofin Council, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in October. It has also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. With the key ECB interest rates at still low levels, money and credit growth dynamic, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative. If our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. Indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner remains essential to ensuring price stability over the medium term. As emphasised on previous occasions, this is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, turning first to the economic analysis. Eurostat’s second estimate confirmed that real GDP growth in the euro area was 0.9% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2006, after 0.8% in the first quarter. Looking through the usual volatility of quarterly growth rates, economic activity has been growing at an average quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.7% over the four quarters to mid-2006, and thus faster than generally expected a year ago. On the basis of various monthly indicators of economic activity and confidence surveys, available up to October, the momentum of the economic expansion is expected to have continued in the second half of this year. In addition, the unemployment rate has been declining, employment growth has recovered and employment expectations remain favourable. All in all, the assessment of a more broadly based and more self-sustaining recovery continues to be confirmed by the incoming data, notwithstanding some possibility of a somewhat slower pace of quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the second half of this year than in the first. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential, although some volatility in the quarterly growth rates is likely to emerge around the turn of the year, mainly reflecting the impact of an increase in indirect taxes in a large euro area country in January 2007. Global economic activity has become more balanced across regions and remains robust, thereby providing ongoing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. Risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, taking into account, in particular, the recent slowing down in the US economy on the one hand and the recent fall in oil prices on the other. The oil price decline – if it were to prove lasting – has the potential to lead to somewhat stronger demand and output growth than embodied in our current baseline scenario for activity in the coming quarters. Over the longer term, risks to growth continue to lie on the downside, relating mainly to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks, and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in October, after having declined to 1.7% in September from 2.3% in August. The recent decline in inflation is the combined result of favourable base effects, given in particular the strong rise in oil prices a year ago, and the recent significant fall in oil prices. While the outlook for energy prices remains uncertain, on the basis of current energy prices and the higher quotations on futures markets, inflation rates are likely to increase again in the next few months and early 2007. As a consequence, we expect a high degree of short-term volatility in the annual HICP inflation rate. Looking through this volatility, however, HICP inflation will remain elevated at a level above 2% on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007. Risks to the outlook for price stability remain clearly on the upside. They continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. Furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. More fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the ongoing improvement in labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities, particularly in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment. The monetary analysis continues to point to upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth rose again to 8.5% in September, after having increased to 8.2% in August. Although the annual growth rate of M1 has moderated somewhat in recent months, reflecting shifts into instruments with more market-related returns in a context of rising interest rates, this has been more than compensated by the stronger expansion of the other components of M3. More generally, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area and the strengthening of economic activity. In particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, their dynamism remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. While the growth of household borrowing shows some signs of stabilisation, albeit at very high rates, the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards and has now reached rates of over 12% on an annual basis, the highest seen since the early 1990s. Thus, when the counterparts of M3 are considered, the main driver of strong monetary growth remains the expansion of credit to the private sector. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ECB’s monetary analysis since mid-2004. Furthermore, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook remaining clearly on the upside. Given the ongoing marked dynamism of monetary growth in an environment of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. If our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. Indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner remains essential to ensuring price stability over the medium term. The Governing Council will therefore exercise strong vigilance. As regards fiscal policy, euro area countries have recently notified their deficit and debt figures for 2005 to the European Commission, and most have reported on developments in 2006 and budget plans for 2007. While, on average, this information points to further, albeit slow improvements in budget balances, this should not give rise to complacency. It is important that commitments under the revised Stability and Growth Pact are met in all euro area countries. It is essential that budgetary consolidation is strengthened in the current economic upswing and that pro-cyclical policies are avoided. This would boost confidence among market participants and the public. To that effect any revenue windfalls from faster than expected growth should be pre-committed and used in full to speed up deficit reduction or to increase surpluses in good times. The prospects for attaining sound budgetary positions improve when consolidation plans are based on credible commitments to reduce expenditure ratios and better expenditure control mechanisms. Finally, let me reiterate previous calls for high quality statistical data and sound statistical reporting, which are key for the prevention and correction of budgetary imbalances. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council stressed the importance of creating a fully operational Single Market and flexible product and labour markets in order to enhance the adjustment capacity of the euro area economy and its resilience to external shocks. Liberalising product markets to allow more competition would raise incentives for firms to invest and innovate, thereby raising productivity growth. Removing labour market rigidities and distortions in wage and price formation are key conditions for promoting more homogeneous cost and price competitiveness trends among euro area countries and for generating sustained output growth and job creation. In particular, wage increases should be guided, in general, by the trend in labour productivity growth, while taking full account of the present level of unit labour costs, in order to preserve or restore price competitiveness. Moreover, it is desirable that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms. The successful implementation of reforms aimed at removing rigidities and inefficiencies in euro area countries would raise potential growth and employment prospects. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * As far as our position of today is concerned, our posture is one of “strong vigilance”. At the last press conference, I mentioned that I would say nothing that would change market expectations as regards what would happen until the end of the year. Our position is crystal clear. Over and beyond this I would say that we will do all that is necessary to ensure price stability and be credible in delivering price stability, in order to remain fully in line with the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations, as I have underlined twice in my introductory remarks. I will give you no other message for our decisions after our next meeting other than “we will do all that will be necessary to do”. I will of course comment on the position of the Governing Council at the next press conference in December. A number of questions. First remark: we have a two-pillar strategy. We look at the economic analysis, we cross-check with the monetary analysis and we make a judgement on the basis of a thorough examination of our two pillars. The monetary pillar has played a very important role. I want you to remember the time when we were called upon by a number of institutions or analysts not to increase rates. We then increased rates in December of last year. It was because cross-checking with the monetary pillar was clearly indicating to us that we had to increase rates. And again, a lot of observers, many economists and some institutions were advising us, on the basis of their own economic analyses, not to do that. So once again: the monetary pillar is important for us and has played, is playing and will continue to play, an important role in guiding our own decisions in a pragmatic way, as has always been the case. It is clear that the latest indications we have of monetary developments have not confirmed what we had seen some months ago when, as you may remember, M3 growth was starting to decline progressively. Let me give you the exact figures: for the evolution of M3 growth, we had 8.5% in June, followed by 7.8% in July when we could see that we had something which was suggesting that perhaps there was the start of a slowdown. And then we had 8.2% in August and now, today, we have 8.5%, back to the June level. So we can see clearly that we have important information coming from the monetary pillar. On the components, we nevertheless see the influence of our monetary policy tightening, because M1, as you know, is now somewhat less dynamic. The three last figures we have on M1 are 7.4%, 7.2% and 7.1%, which suggest that the most liquid component of M3 is a little less dynamic. And this, of course, is fully in line with our increase of interest rates. As I have said, we look very carefully at all the components of the monetary pillar and at all its counterparts. As far as counterparts are concerned, we have very dynamic credit growth, particularly credit to the private sector, households and the corporate sector. All this calls for very careful monitoring, as I have said before. On 2007, I will confirm to you that we will do what we have done in the past, namely whatever is necessary to deliver price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. And I will see you at the next press conference and comment on our analysis in December. As regards inflation, I have said that we are experiencing a decrease in headline inflation. It is transitory. I expect that at the end of the year and beginning of next year, when we have the figures for December, and then those for January, that we will probably be at a substantially higher level, because we have those base effects, and a number of phenomena that create volatility in this domain. What we look at ourselves, of course, is not yesterday’s inflation or that of the day before. It is inflation over a period of, say, one-and-a-half to two years, because that is our own medium-term horizon, and beyond. Again looking at this horizon and beyond, we will do all that is necessary to ensure price stability that is in line with our definition of price stability, namely less than and close to 2%. Thus far, thanks to our credibility, the anchoring of inflation expectations has been in line with our definition of price stability. First of all, we are extremely attached to the credibility of the notes themselves, which are very reliable and very much appreciated by the public and the users – our 313 million fellow citizens. The Bundesbank published at 12.30 p.m. today a communiqué which explains what the Bundesbank and the Eurosystem understands about what might have happened. I would only draw your attention to the fact that, according to present knowledge, we have 1,500 notes that were fragile and “fragilised” by a phenomenon, which I will come back to later, out of a total of 10.5 billion notes in circulation, 5 billion of which are in Germany, as Germany is particularly keen on notes. So, with this order of magnitude, it is fortunately a very small proportion of all notes. This incident has absolutely nothing to do with the production of the notes or with the printing works. What comes out of the first analyses that have been made is that it looks like these notes have been weakened by an acid impregnation. The Bundesbank, as is absolutely normal, shipped those notes to specialist laboratories at the Federal Criminal Investigation Offices in Berlin and Mainz for further examination. This examination concluded that nothing in the production of the notes was in question: not the paper mill, and not the printing works. There are a number of assumptions as to what happened exactly, and why these notes were plunged into an acid. I do not want to elaborate too much on that, because there are still investigations under way and we will see exactly what it is all about. But it cannot be excluded – but I say that with great caution – that these notes had been stolen, were impregnated with a certain liquid at the moment of the criminal action and were then impregnated with other chemical products in order to eliminate the initial impregnation of chemicals aimed at preventing any further use of the stolen notes. Let me explain: when you bring notes from one safe to another or from one vault to another, you have sometimes a mechanism which impregnates the notes with red ink in order to prevent further use of the notes when they are stolen. It is a way of protecting notes against the possibility of being stolen. It is a well known process to prevent robberies. Again it is an assumption, and I draw your attention to the fact that I say this with extreme caution, but perhaps, after having being stolen, these notes, already impregnated with the first liquid, might have been attempted to be “cleaned” by the robbers and that operation might have weakened these notes. Again I say that with great caution: we will see exactly what has happened after the full inquiry. At present, I can say that we have no other information from other central banks of the euro area, but of course we will continue to follow all this very carefully. Again, it is fortunately a very small proportion. At the same time it does not call into question, in any respect, the credibility of the notes in circulation: I gave you the figures – 1,500 out of 5 billion in Germany. But we will continue to investigate. The Bundesbank has done a great job, and I will not subscribe to any criticism against the Bundesbank which did exactly what had to be done. On the fiscal analysis I entirely confirm your analysis. We are clearly saying that the windfall profits that are coming from better than expected growth, which is the case in a number of countries and economies, should be fully pre-committed to diminishing the level of public finance deficit. And we also add that, for those countries that have a surplus, it should be allocated to augmenting the surplus in good times. So that is clear, and I entirely confirm what you have said. I certainly confirm that we do not refer to a neutral rate in the Governing Council of the ECB and that we have not changed in any respect our concept of monetary policy, which has proved to be very efficient and has permitted us to have the credibility that you know. I would only say that this was a personal view of a member of the Governing Council, but it does not reflect at all the position of the Governing Council. Question : Mr President, coming back to inflation. Given that oil prices have fallen 20% in the last three months, is there a good chance perhaps that next year you will already achieve your price stability target, and could you give us an insight into your view on what is likely to happen with inflation in 2008? Is it still likely to be over 2%? I will confirm that I will see you again at the next press conference following the Governing Council meeting in December, when we will have the projections, and that I will tell you then what our Eurosystem staff projections are. I also remind you that we do not underwrite the staff projections, whether they are ECB staff projections or Eurosystem staff projections. We look at them as an important input, and we also look at a number of other analyses. We make our judgement on the basis of all these inputs. At this moment, I would say – with some element of caution, because we will have the projections in December – that the likelihood of the level of the headline consumer price index, as an average, being above 2% this year is certain, and remains likely for next year, on the basis of all the information that I have at this moment. Of course, we do not reason in the short term, we reason in the medium term. We ensure that we deliver, in the medium term, price stability which is in line with our definition, namely close to but below 2%, and we do all that we have to do to deliver this price stability in the medium term. I didn’t see the article in question, but I certainly deeply disagree. I’m judging the person, and he has a very important responsibility, an extraordinarily difficult responsibility, obviously, and that’s clear. Perhaps the paper in question was confusing the person with the difficulty of his job. But let me tell you first that to the extent that we are looking at fiscal issues, I would say that in practically all of the areas concerned, and in practically all countries, we would probably say that we judge that further efforts should be made to diminish public expenditure. I have already said that several times here. One problem is the deficit and strict respect of the Stability and Growth Pact. There is another issue, which is the absolute level of public spending as a proportion of GDP. And we know that the level in the euro area is much higher than the average for the OECD countries or the G7, for instance, to take just two benchmarks from the constituency of industrialised economies. So there we know that we have a problem. We know that we tend to have higher levels of public spending than others, and of course, in the present world of increasing competition and profound and very rapid changes, this doesn’t work in our favour. So I would say that Italy would certainly be one of those countries where it would be appropriate to further reduce public spending. That being said, my present understanding of the situation in Italy – and I would say in that respect, as in all others, I am in full agreement with Mario Draghi – is certainly that what is extraordinarily important at the present juncture is that the Italian budget, with regard to the final result in terms of the deficit, is not in any way watered down, that it goes through the parliamentary process without being watered down, with the result at the end of the process being identical to what was introduced by the Minister of Finance and the government at the beginning. At this stage, I would say that this is absolutely key. If you have less public spending, then you can have fewer tax increases. It is purely arithmetical. Of course, we always have, in all cases, a preference for this kind of solution – reducing public spending, but earmarking that reduced public spending as being for the reduction of the public finance deficit. And then, if anything is left over, you reduce taxation. I would certainly hope so, but I do not want to anticipate our own projections, so we will see what our own projections are. All that we do is to permit, in the medium term, inflation to be in line with our definition of price stability. So, I would say I am not in a different mode from what I said in Paris in this respect. As regards economic activity we have had a very good – I would say more than good – first semester; indeed it has been exceptionally favourable. We have also had a favourable period over the last, say, four quarters. I draw your attention to the fact that this vindicates, in a very clear way, our diagnosis which started in mid-2005 and was fully confirmed when we increased rates in December. And you remember we were criticised at the time: some were saying that we tightened much too early; others were telling us that the last quarter of last year’s growth was not flattering – which appears to be slightly true: now, after revision, it is 0.4%, while at the time it was estimated at 0.3%, which was mediocre. But now that we have the full perspective and can see what happened over the last four quarters – particularly over the first two quarters of 2006 – we see that we have been fully vindicated. As regards the second semester: as I said, we still expect robust growth – less flattering than in the first semester, which was absolutely exceptional, but it would remain substantial growth, certainly around potential, perhaps hovering a little over potential. We will see exactly what happens. As regards the US slowdown, my colleagues and I mentioned that in our own deliberations; I told you a moment ago that it was something that we had to mention. At the present time, I would say that we are making the working assumption that this slowdown would be a soft slowdown. We are not making the working assumption that it could be a hard landing. I draw your attention to the fact that the direct and indirect trade impact on us – I said that in Paris – is not something which is too substantial. I quoted the figure of a 1% slowdown in the United States transmitting -0.2% for growth in the euro area, taking into account the direct effect and the echo effect on the rest of the world as well. That being said, it is of course linked to the fact that our trade with the United States is less important than is frequently assumed. The United Kingdom is more important for us than the United States – only to give you an example. Also to be taken into account is the fact that, at the global level, what we see is that the slowdown in the United States is partially or might be partially offset by continuous robust growth in a large part of the rest of the world, which creates an overall environment which remains quite dynamic, seen from the euro area standpoint. As regards the various decisions that are taken by central banks as regards their reserve assets, we take exactly the same attitude as we take with all economic agents, all investors and savers the world over. We have no policy of encouraging any such holdings and no policy of discouraging them. We consider that each institution, each private or public agent has to take their decision, on the basis of their own analysis. What we have observed up to now has been a smooth and orderly evolution since the creation of the euro. I would say that provided it is a smooth and orderly evolution, we have no reason to comment on it. As regards the second question that you asked, I would say that we have quite a diverse situation from economy to economy as regards labour productivity growth. This is a way to tell each particular economy in the euro area that they have to take into account their level and evolution of unit labour costs, the overall cost-competitiveness of the economy, and the arbitrage between insiders and outsiders on the labour market, when they devise their decisions on wages and salaries in particular. It is absolutely clear that any increase over and above what would be reasonable, taking into account the labour productivity progress, would hamper sustainable growth, hamper job creation and contribute to more inflation. So in the interest of the country in question, in the interest of the euro area itself, in the interest of ensuring price stability, it is advisable to follow the recommendation of a wise and sound posture. My second question is just a follow-up on the labour productivity issue. It is very clear to me how this line is a cautionary note to certain parts, certain members, of the euro area. I have to say, though, if I were, say, a German metalworker reading this, I would say “We have had incredible labour productivity growth over the last few years and we have no problems with competitiveness”. It would be hard not to read that as a signal to seek a solid pay increase this year. Would that be a correct reading? As regards VAT, I don’t think we have changed the previous messages in that respect. The fact that we have mentioned VAT in Germany as influencing growth and also creating volatility associated with it was in the statement or in the questions and answers a number of times already in such press conferences. We have incorporated that in all our analysis since the decision was taken by the German government. And it is important of course that we take it into account. We will see exactly what happens. As you know, there is a mainstream analysis that suggests that we will have a hump in the last quarter of this year and then the bust after the hump. We will see exactly what happens. Further administered price increases are one of the risks that we are regularly quoting because we really believe that it is a threat that we have to take into account. When we look at the past, it has played a significant role in the inflation that has been observed until now. We will see exactly what happens. Again, it’s a risk – I hope very much that it will not materialise – but it is a risk. As regards 2007, I have already said what I wanted to say. We will see exactly what our judgement is on the basis of the new projections, of the new figures that we will have, and of all the information that will be available. In any case, it is already being very predictable that you have little doubt on what we will do next month. So don’t be too demanding, frankly speaking. In any case you know that we never pre-commit in the medium term. Several times when our rates were at 2%, we were repeatedly asked “Could you guarantee that there will not be any increases in your interest rates over a considerable period of time?” You remember the wording. And we had said “No, we will not tell you that we will not move in the months to come because we are alert and we will do whatever is necessary to cope with risks and threats to price stability”. And the same, you remember, when we started increasing rates. There were a lot of requests to the effect “Why don’t you say that you will increase every month or every two months, regularly?” We said “No, we are alert, we will see what has to be done, taking into account our analysis of the situation”. With the benefit of hindsight you see that it worked very well: we happen to be very predictable; and the market has understood - it seems to me – pretty correctly what we had in mind. As regards labour productivity, let us take the example of this country that you choose – you have picked up on one particular country. I said that we have had the problem of inflation, we have the problem of competitiveness, and we have the problem of unemployment. At the present level of unemployment it is clear that this issue is very important. There is to be taken into account the interest of those whom I would call the outsiders, those who have no job today. It is an issue which is important in all countries as well as in Germany; it is not particularly a German problem. It is true that the productivity progress was quite good in the past in Germany and it is equally true that unit labour costs have moved slowly in comparison with the average, but it was justified by a catching-up exercise. You remember that for this particular economy, after reunification, cost-competitiveness was not satisfactory at all. The cost-competitiveness of this economy, Germany, had to catch up, which is being done, and is being done regularly, year after year. I would say that the main argument for wage restraint would certainly be today the level of unemployment. What we have to deliver is price stability in the medium run and what I have observed in the past is that the contribution of administered prices on inflation has been substantial year after year after year – even if it seems bizarre, because we should not normally have to cope with such a big contribution of administered prices. But we have to take that into account, as it's undoubtedly a problem. I do not welcome, in general, administered price increases. And I would say that if some are augmented, for example I understand pretty well why tobacco should be augmented – there is absolutely no problem there, although I think that perhaps the smokers in this room would not be at all satisfied – but I would say for health reasons we can have good reason to do that. But then I would call for other prices to be reduced in order for us and for overall inflation not to be hit by these decisions. That being said, it is not my job to enter into fine-tuning such decisions, as they are the responsibility of the executive branches, but as a general rule we do not like at all their net impact on inflation. As regards the mention of some consideration on cycles of interest rate hikes and so forth, I stick to what I have said. Everything you have seen or read or heard are personal views and have absolutely nothing to do with the views of the Governing Council which I am transmitting to you right now. This is one of the most important issues that we all have to deal with. On both sides of the Atlantic we have the same shape of yield curve, the same very low level of real rates, and the same extremely low level of nominal rates. It is true that we have – the last time I looked at the figures – ten-year euro rates on the Bund benchmark; we had 3.72%, which is extraordinarily low. The conclusion that we could draw from the yield curve as it stands is much disputed. And I would say that the majority of economists – certainly on the other side of the Atlantic but also on this side of the Atlantic too – would not say that the present slope of the yield curve means that there is a very high risk of recession. It is considered that you have to introduce a large number of other elements to conclude, and I said myself that our working assumption – which is shared, it seems to me, by the mainstream analysis and certainly by our friends on the other side of the Atlantic, in the sister institution – is that a soft slowdown is very likely. Now you will ask me how it is possible that there are such very low levels of long-term interest rates. But you have answered this question yourself, saying that it is the accumulation of past liquidity. I am not sure that this a fully appropriate explanation, or the only explanation. There is an element there, it is clear, and the fact that we have all increased rates means that – in any case – we judged that the previous monetary policy had become too accommodating at a certain moment. And we have gradually corrected that. But there is also another element which is certainly important: the creeping oil shock. For several years, every year, until most recently, there has been an increase in the price of oil, the accumulation of additional current account surpluses by oil exporters, and this has created – on top of what we had observed even before the creeping oil shock, on top of the global savings that existed before – an additional and significant volume of “forced savings” that are taken by the oil exporters out of the rest of the world and are creating an additional volume of capital chasing investments at a global level. This is not a normal way of looking at things, as you generally have investments chasing capital rather than the reverse. When you have such capital chasing investment, it creates an environment where capital is abundant, and pushes down the price of risk in general. And that might explain in particular why we have such a low level of long-term rates on both sides of the Atlantic and everywhere in the world. And that would be totally independent from the long medium-term prediction by the market of what is likely to happen in the economies concerned. That being said, we will see exactly what happens. We work a lot to analyse the situation, to better understand the financial markets. As you know, we have the feeling that this cannot last forever, and that the present accumulation of the very low level of real rates, the very low level of spreads, the very low level of risk premium that we are observing, the underestimation of risks in general – will necessarily be corrected. Our present working assumption is that there will be a soft correction – not a sharp and abrupt correction. But, as I have said several times already, there will be a correction. Question : I was wondering if you could help me to understand two of your statements. One is where you say that it is crucial for the social partners to continue to meet their responsibilities. I am wondering if there is some message here to companies as regards the way they manage profit margins in the context of expansion in the near future. Should they still be restricting them or not? Are you afraid that that might happen or not? My second question is: I was wondering if you could explain your thinking on this idea of a stronger pass-through from past oil prices into consumer prices. What might be the rationale to explain a stronger or less strong pass-through? And finally, in 2007 Portugal will probably be the only country with a budget deficit above 3%. Some pessimistic observers, like Standard & Poor’s, even say that we might even be above 3% in 2008. The Portuguese government made its budget proposal two weeks ago, but I do not know if you have had the opportunity today to take a look at the figures? “Social partners” means that one has to take into consideration everything that I have said on competitiveness, on the level of unemployment and on the need to maintain price stability, so I will not elaborate further. As regards companies, I would certainly call on companies to take into account the fact that they have a range of ways of financing themselves that is really very impressive. I see that they are now increasingly taking advantage of this favourable financial environment, because, the contribution made by gross capital formation to euro area growth is quite substantial. It is 0.9% over the last four quarters that are known, compared with a level of growth which is around 2.7%, so it is now a contribution which is in the order of magnitude of the contribution of private consumption. We really do have a level of investment which is becoming quite dynamic, and I would say in this respect that this is paving the way for the future, so this is good. As regards the pass-through – again, it is a risk. A stronger than expected pass-through means that we see an impact on prices that exceeds what is presently in our own understanding and projections. It is in the analysis of risks that we say that we might have to cope with a pass-through which is stronger than previously expected. On Portugal, I would only say that Portugal has to strictly observe the Stability and Growth Pact. This is a principle that we consider to be very important for everyone. To my knowledge, this is agreed upon not only, of course, by the Commission – that goes without saying – but also by the Council. The problem, again, is delivery. On the first point I will not say anything more than I have already said. You can observe what we have done in the past. In the past, we had a long period of time with a level of 2% during which we did not move. We communicated very clearly with the markets, so I think that there is absolutely no problem: when you decide, you communicate and the market understands pretty well what you are doing. I am very clear that we will do in 2007 exactly what is needed to deliver price stability and to be credible in ensuring price stability. As regards the second question on the yen, I already said what I thought on this particular issue on the occasion of the G7 meeting in Singapore, and I would say that nothing today would drive me to change what I have already said. "
05/10/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Paris. I would particularly like to thank Governor Noyer for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to the staff of the Banque de France for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today’s meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. Today’s decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Also after today’s increase, the key ECB interest rates remain at low levels, money and credit growth are strong, and liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Our monetary policy therefore continues to be accommodative. If our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. The Governing Council will therefore continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. Turning first to the economic analysis, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real GDP in the euro area for the second quarter of 2006 was confirmed at 0.9%. Moreover, since our previous meeting on 31 August, Eurostat has revised upwards the growth data for the two preceding quarters, thereby confirming that a significant acceleration in economic expansion has taken place over the past few quarters. On the basis of the revised data, economic activity has been growing at a quarterly rate of 0.7% on average over the last four quarters, the unemployment rate has been on a falling trend, employment growth has recovered and employment expectations overall have remained favourable. All in all, the economic recovery now appears somewhat stronger than on the basis of earlier data. It has become more broadly based and is mainly supported by domestic demand. The available information on activity in the third quarter – coming from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates – continues to support the assessment that economic activity will grow robustly while possibly moderating somewhat. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2006 and 2007, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential, with some volatility in the quarterly growth rates likely to emerge around the turn of the year. Global economic activity has become more balanced across regions and is still robust, thereby providing ongoing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. Risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, although the recent fall in oil prices – if it were to prove lasting – has the potential to lead to somewhat stronger demand and output growth than embodied in our baseline scenario for activity in the coming quarters. Over the longer term, risks to growth lie on balance on the downside, and relate mainly to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks, and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation fell to 1.8% in September 2006, from 2.3% in August. Although no detailed breakdown is available as yet, this relatively sharp decline seems to be the combined result of favourable base effects, given in particular the strong rise in oil prices a year ago, and the recent significant fall in oil prices. While the outlook for energy prices is uncertain, on the basis of current energy prices and the higher quotations on futures markets, overall inflation rates are likely to increase again towards the end of the year and in early 2007. As a consequence, we expect a considerable degree of short-term volatility in the annual HICP inflation rate, while the overall inflation rate will remain elevated at levels above 2% on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007. In addition, risks to the outlook for price developments remain clearly on the upside. They continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. Furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. More fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities, in particular in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment. The monetary analysis continues to point to upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth rose again to 8.2% in August and, more generally, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area. In particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, these developments remain consistent with the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ECB’s monetary analysis since mid-2004. Moreover, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of still ample liquidity, as a result of the persistently high rate of monetary expansion over the past few years, point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook remaining clearly on the upside. Given the ongoing dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. If our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. The Governing Council will therefore continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. As regards fiscal policy, euro area countries are now in the process of finalising their 2007 budgets and preparing their next stability programme updates. In the current favourable economic environment, it is essential that adequate headway be made towards sound public finances, implying that budget targets for 2007 should generally be more ambitious than in previous programmes. Countries in excessive deficit need to remain fully committed to bringing their deficits to below 3% within the agreed deadline via adequate and credible structural consolidation. Other countries need to make clear progress towards their medium-term objectives in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. In all cases, any revenue windfalls from faster than expected growth should be used to speed up deficit reduction or to increase surpluses. Pro-cyclical policies should be avoided and expenditure restraint is of particular importance, also given the high spending ratios and taxes as compared with many other industrialised countries. Experience has shown that expenditure reform is key to successful consolidation, and consolidation is essential for reducing overall public debt and for making public finances less vulnerable to the impact of ageing populations. Fiscal consolidation is likely to be most successful when coupled with comprehensive structural reforms. These are urgently needed to help to cushion the unfavourable economic effects of the projected demographic change in the euro area. The decline in the working age population will place further pressure on pension and health care systems, and may have wide-ranging economic consequences. In order to support the potential economic growth of the euro area, to foster macroeconomic flexibility and dynamism, and to safeguard the future standard of living of our citizens, labour and product market reforms are urgently needed. This will increase labour market participation and employment and strengthen innovation and the other forces driving productivity and economic growth. The ECB will play its part by continuing to maintain price stability over the medium term. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * In our deliberations we always, as you know, consider all arguments, and the assets and liabilities associated with all decisions – and, just as we considered not moving to be an inappropriate decision, we also considered moving by fifty basis points to be an inappropriate decision. We were overwhelmingly in favour of this increase of 25 basis points. First of all and to be even more explicit, I would mention that we were unanimous in taking that decision and in analysing the appropriate decision to take in these circumstances. I mentioned that further withdrawal of monetary accommodation was warranted if we have confirmation of our baseline scenario. As regards the future moves I would say nothing else. You mentioned that the market has in mind a move before the end of the year. I would not say anything that would correct this sentiment. I will not comment on that. We will see what we have to do. As you know, we always do what is necessary to deliver price stability in the medium run and to be credible in the delivery of price stability, which is absolutely necessary to anchor solidly inflationary expectations. Our permanent posture is to do whatever it is necessary to do. First of all, let me remind all of us: when we told observers, investors, savers, economists, market participants that we believed that we had to move rates upwards – you certainly remember that –we did that some time before we increased rates in December. You may recall that we were in an environment in which a large number of analysts including international institutions and a significant proportion of the market literature were signalling that, according to their economic analysis, we were not fully justified to increase rates. I have a vivid memory of that. Perhaps those of you who were in Frankfurt also have a memory of that. And those who are in Paris today may also have a memory of that, and of all the declarations and analyses of the time. We decided to increase rates for the first time after a long period in December with the benefit of the hindsight the decision appears to have been fully justified. And I have seen progressively that the full body of global economic analysis whether public or private has come to agree on our position. When we decided it was not only our economic analysis that played an important role. The monetary analysis played a very important role, too. We were determined to raise the rates because the information we were getting from the monetary analysis was signalling that there were risks in the medium to longer term. As you know, we look very carefully at all indicators. You will remember that I had signalled at the last two press conferences that we were observing a certain tendency of M3 to go down. Now I have to take a look at the figures: in August, we are back to 8.2%. The sequence for M3 in the most recent period of time, you may recall, was 8.8% in May, 8.5% in June, 7.8% in July and now 8.2% in August. If I take the three-month moving average, it has come down from 8.6% to 8.3%, and we are now at 8.2%. So we have there information that we have to look at very carefully to understand exactly what are the dynamics behind M3. To give you some figures, loans to the private sector are growing – according to the August figures – at a rate of 11.3%. Loans to the non-financial corporate sector are growing at a rate of 12%. And the rate for lending for house purchase is 11.1%, while consumer credit is rising at a rate of 9.2%. So, we have a set of counterparts to M3 that remain very dynamic and, in particular it is loans to the non-financial corporate sector that are quite dynamic. All this again calls for very close monitoring, as I have already said. On the euro/yen, I will stick to what I had said in Singapore. As regards your first question I must say that, of course, the global economy exerts an influence on what our own economy will do. We are a very important part of the global economy. The best summing-up I can give from the Singapore meeting and the confrontation of various analyses is that we were experiencing an extraordinary period of very robust global growth, around 5% for the fourth consecutive year probably in 07, so a very impressive episode of growth in’04, ’05, ’06, and probably ‘07. And at the same time, the uncertainties were also seen on the increase and so we have to take account of those two elements: Solid growth on the one hand, uncertainties rising on the other hand. We will see what happens. I hope very much that these downward risks will not materialise. There are very good reasons to think that they will not materialise. But we have to take them into account anyway. As I said, over the shorter-term, we have economic growth here in Europe, in the euro area, which, in terms of risks, is broadly balanced, and even perhaps a bit on the upside if I take the immediate influence of the lower price of oil to foster growth. In the longer term, we continue to think that risks to growth remain on the downside, for all the reasons I have already said, and I could add some other reasons, but the main reasons we see are first the uncertainty about the price of oil and second the very important risk, that we could have confirmation of, that protectionist pressures are themselves materialising: it is something which is very adverse to growth at a global level and at the European level. Third we have also the permanent threats that are associated with the global risks connected with the disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and the market risks which are embedded at a global level. So we have to take all that into consideration. As regards your second question I will not enter into our baseline scenario. If the baseline scenario was not confirmed, whether it would be upward or downward, we would draw the appropriate consequences. We have a compass and we have a needle in our compass: it is price stability, the delivery of price stability in the medium-term and the credibility of the delivery of price stability. It is because we are credible in the delivery of price stability that our inflationary expectations are anchored in line with our definition of price stability. This solid anchoring is essential, as I have said, for sustainable growth and job creation in the medium and long-term. As regards the profile of HICP due to the VAT increase in one big economy in the euro area, clearly there we have, I would say, a mainstream analysis which is suggesting that we will have a hump in HICP, starting in January 2007 it is extraordinarily likely, arithmetically speaking, and there is also a probability of having more consumption in the last quarter of this year, and less consumption in the first quarter of next year. That's also clearly suggested by the situation. As you know, there are several schools of thought around the mainstream analysis, and we will see exactly what happens. My sentiment - and I am communicating the overall sentiment of the Governing Council - is that after a relatively short period of volatility we will go back to more normal behaviour. We should not pay too much attention to the short-term volatility that would be induced by this phenomenon. In any case we think in the Governing Council that we must extract information from all sources we have as far as data, facts, figures are concerned, and extract from that an assessment on the trend. You remember we had a very poor quarter in the last quarter last year. It was, until the recent revision upward, only 0.3%, it was disappointing obviously but we said it doesn’t put into question our understanding of what is the trend growth. And the results of the first and second quarters of this year confirmed that our assessment of the situation was fully justified. (translation) This is an excellent question which was commented on by our former colleague Alan Greenspan, who spoke of a “conundrum”; that remains. You will remember that we still have long-term interest rates which are exceptionally low, both in Europe and in the United States. That is a shared global level. When you try to understand what that means, you will see that we extract all possible information from the financial markets. And extracting all that information you will see that, especially in the recent past, the trend has been for a decrease in real interest rates. You can see that very clearly if you look at indexed bonds. I think that that shows a very clear phenomenon world-wide. And then we have what I might call modest but favourable developments in terms of the anchoring of inflation expectations. I would say on both sides of the Atlantic, but certainly here in Europe, we are seeing the confirmation of this anchoring of inflation expectations and, as I always say, that is something which is extremely important for us. So it is a combination of these two factors – real interest rates, which are objectively low, and inflation expectations, which are anchored at the appropriate level – which gives us the results that we see. Now, the reasons for this are very complex. There are traditional analyses on the interaction between investment and savings at world level, which until the very recent past made us think for good reasons that Asian savings, which, as you know, are very high, traditionally, go hand in hand with a certain restrain in investing in industrialised countries. That might be part of the explanation for the whole development. But you have also seen that enormous amounts of savings have been amassed, and are still being amassed by the oil-exporting countries, maybe not exactly quite as fast today as they were, but the increase is still very considerable, and obviously that is an additional element, when you try to compare savings and investment at world level. There may be other phenomena, on which we are also looking at, including market phenomena, which could also explain what we are seeing at the moment. But what is clear is that we have the feeling that this won’t necessarily last - at least not forever - and that this period that we are in at the moment is really a period of real long-term interest rates at very low levels. With the benefit of hindsight, you will see that this has been an exceptional period. But, in addition to everything that I have said, that is to say low real long-term interest rates in Europe and in the United States on the best signatures, you have an assessment of risk which, even after the corrections of May and June, remains at a low level. So, you have a high level of the risk appetite in all of the financial markets, and that risk appetite probably won’t last forever either. These are a few comments I wanted to make on this question. What we are responsible for is obviously– not only, but mainly – inflation expectations in the medium and long term. We pay very close attention to those expectations and, as I have said, it seems to us that these inflation expectations, on the basis of the indicators that we have at the moment, seem to be correctly anchored In my view it is because nobody doubts our determination, given the fact that we have proven that we intend to be inflexible in fulfilling our mandate. (translation) We looked very carefully at what was happening. I have to say that like everything we have seen on the markets – I’ve talked about the events of May and June – this event itself has been absorbed by the market very fast and quite easily. So there is a high level of resilience in world capital markets. But that does not mean, obviously, that there are no risks, and that those risks are not of great importance. I am convinced – and we are all convinced – that there are important risks and that is why we have to be vigilant as regards market risks. We cannot sit back and let these risks go by without reacting. In our last Financial Stability Review, we had stressed - Lucas Papademos will certainly remember that because he was the one who presented the report - the risks associated with hedge funds and we even had a specific box in that report in order to explain to all the observers how we see the risks posed by hedge funds. Now, it is quite obvious that we can and must improve the situation in this area, even if it is a very subtle question, and even if, as I have already said, we need world-wide solutions in this area. For this problem there is no partial solution for just one continent, because it is a problem that does arise at world level. When we will judge that monetary policy is not accommodative, we will tell you. This is as simple as that and answers your third question very easily. As regards your first question, I responded to an earlier question which was addressing the expectations until the end of December and I have said, that I have nothing to say which would be aiming at moving these expectations. And I stick to what I said already. As regards beyond the end of the year, I have absolutely nothing to say. You all know that we will do what is necessary to deliver price stability and anchor solidly inflationary expectations. That will be as always based upon facts, figures and overall events on which we will make our judgement in the light of our monetary strategy as we always do. It is part of our own strategy, as you know, never to pre-commit in advance, in the medium term. We do what is necessary and the market can draw its own conclusions from the information which will be available in the oil price area, in the global economy area, in all other areas we take into account to preserve price stability. We have to work out a synthesis and it is what the market and the economists are doing for their own part. As regards inflation in 2008 we will publish our staff projections in December, and they will include 2008. At this stage, all that I can say is that, according to all information I have, in 2007 it would be probably as an average over and above 2%, but there is of course a great influence from various parameters, including the price of oil as regards headline inflation next year. Then our own strategy is such, that over a period of 18 to 24 months, we will be below 2% in line with our definition of price stability. But we will see exactly what is embedded in our next staff projections. First of all, since Singapore I would say that the analysis of Singapore was very much confirmed. Remember I said growth uncertainties were on the upside. So in a way what has happened since then was confirming this judgement. The main element has been the price of oil, as you know it is a twofold phenomenon: it diminishes immediate headline inflation, arithmetically, and it fosters growth, because the overall drain on the global economy is less acute. That, in our perspective - which is to maintain price stability in the medium-run in order to fulfil our mandate and, by way of consequence, to contribute to sustainable growth and job creation –is complex. You have a phenomenon of headline inflation which is lower, which in a way is better from the perspective of the spill-over for the next years as regards inflation. But on the other hand, you have an activity which might be more buoyant and that of course entails risks for inflation. So I would say that we have to look at it from all possible angles to be sure that our final judgement is well founded That is exactly the reverse of when the prices are going up. Then we have also a mix of phenomena, headline inflation higher, a drain on growth because of the price of oil that is higher and then we have to draw the appropriate consequences for medium-term inflation. Never forget that we are thinking about the medium term. As regards housing in the US and the US economy as a whole, you know that an order of magnitude which would perhaps be considered by economists as a good order of magnitude would be that the trade coupling, plus the “echo”, the reverberation of the US economy on the rest of the world, which impacts also indirectly on the euro area would perhaps be summed up by the fact that if the US economy slows down by 1%, more or less, we have ourselves an impact on our growth, taking everything into account, of minus 0.2%. It’s an order of magnitude, I say that with great caution, which means that there is an impact, but that impact is not necessarily too large, depending on what happens in the United States. I know that there are a number of schools of thought that believe that the US will continue to be going steadily, others are thinking that we are at the beginning of something which could be more ample. As a matter of fact, we don’t know. Our baseline scenario remains that the slowdown in the US will be moderate and in line with a soft correction which is in line with present observations. So we will see what happens, but it is absolutely true that we are influenced by a number of other very important developments. I need also to mention and I do that from time to time, in terms of trade the UK is more important for us than the US, and that of course appears a little bit paradoxical taking the size of the two economies concerned but it is what the figures are telling us. An element I would mention “en passant” and that has now been documented is that we see that our market share in the oil-exporting countries is quite significant. There of course we have an element of additional contribution to growth in the euro area and in Europe in general. As regards the real estate sector, I would only say that we have been looking very closely at this now for a long period of time. I’ve responded very often to such questions, you know to what extent we are in a complex situation in this respect because we have Germany which is still not dynamic, even if things are changing gradually, other economies are very dynamic. We will see how it moves. I would not compare Europe with the US, but I already quoted the figure of 11.1% as regards growth of lending for house purchases. That it is something which is obviously very dynamic at the level of the euro area as a whole also taking into account that Germany is much less dynamic. In answer to your first question, I repeat that our baseline scenario is that the trend growth is around potential – as I said in my Introductory Statement. I have absolutely no information to give you that contradicts the baseline scenario, so I fully confirm it. As regards OPEC and the price of oil in general, it is true that there is a big difference from the global economic standpoint and consequently for all parts of the world – whatever their size – and certainly for the euro area. The difference is between a demand-driven increase in the price of oil: you have a very dynamic global economy, which triggers demand, which in turn drives up the price of oil; here you have a phenomenon that is well-known, well-founded because it is really dictated by supply and demand. It is a different case when you have something which is more artificial, which is a control of supply based upon an administrative decision. This was the case with the first and second oil shocks and these administrative decisions are of course of a totally different nature. So we shall see what happens. I am not satisfied in that domain or others by ex ante administrative decisions. As regards the impact of our interest rate decisions, if you look very carefully at the components of M3 you will see that there is an impact which is important. There is a substitution of those pure deposits that are not remunerated at market rates with those components of M3 that are remunerated at market rates, and this phenomenon is quite big so we see the impact of our interest rate increases. That being said as regards the counterparts on the credit side I mentioned figures that are quite dynamic. Part of it is in the area of households, where consumer credit is clearly very dynamic but less dynamic than the lending for house purchases. I mentioned the figure of 11.1% for house purchases and 9.2% for consumer credit. I also have to mention the great corporate dynamism, which seems to be due to two major phenomena: investment – and one of the good pieces of news that we have at the level of the euro area is that growth over the last period, particularly in Q2 of this year but also beforehand, seems to have been driven by gross capital formation. This contributed over the past twelve months to a rate of growth which – all things taken into account– is of the order of magnitude of 2.6%. We have a contribution of 0.9% coming from gross capital formation, which is quite substantial; it represents even a contribution of 0.4% in Q2, and that is very important to know. And then we also have the merger and acquisitions phenomenon, which is very important and explains also this dynamism at the level of 12% for loans to the non-financial corporate sector. As regards the overall group of ten countries which have joined us I would say that, all things taken into account, the transformation of these countries – driven in particular by foreign direct investment coming from the rest of the world and from the fifteen and from the euro area as part of the fifteen – has been really quite impressive. Of course, there is a great difference between countries but the overall result is impressive. We have observed developments that were going in the right direction; developments that were going in the wrong direction; it is a very complex phenomenon. I do not want to cite any particular country, but I will say one thing in the case of one country which I have already mentioned as creating a problem. I refer to Poland and the problems that the central bank had in Poland vis-à-vis the executive branch. As you know, we consider that this was not in line with the rules in the European Union, and I must confess that I was myself very heartened to see that the feeling that something abnormal had been done was shared by a major institution: the constitutional court in Poland; so I would mention that as something that we have noted. For the rest I would say that what is happening in the ten is remarkable, all things taken into account. It represents a transformation, which of course from time to time encounters real difficulties; and as you know we are doing all that we can to pave the way for the best possible outcome. Our colleagues (including from Romania and Bulgaria as observers) are represented in all our committees in the ESCB, and we consider it our duty to facilitate things in the best possible fashion. – That being said, to enter in the euro area the criteria must be rigorously met. So everybody knows what conclusion we drew when we looked at the cases of two countries which wanted to join the euro area. One clearly met the criteria, in our opinion; the other did not. We said so candidly and clearly, and we shall of course be welcoming Slovenia to the euro area on 1 January next year. As regards your question on the euro and the yen I already said that I stick to what I said in Singapore. On your first question, maybe you weren't listening to the translation or maybe you were listening to English directly. I don't know but, quite on the contrary, we emphasised this point very strongly. We said more fundamentally that, given the very favourable dynamism of real growth of the GDP which we have seen over the last few quarters and given the strong growth in the jobs market in Europe at the moment, wage and salary increases that would be higher than what expected at the moment - would pose serious risks to price stability. Therefore we said that it is absolutely essential for social partners to live up to their responsibilities. We did consider this as important and we emphasised this point. Turning to your second question, the only thing I can say is that if we look at prices and price indicators and we distil from these the prices of imported products and especially the prices of imported manufactured goods, there we see that - for quite some time now - you no longer see the same phenomenon of very strong disinflation with prices that were regularly and considerably going down previously. What we now see, quite independently of the economies and the continents concerned, whether the United States or Europe, is that this disinflation has slowed down or, that those particular prices of imported goods have increased and are above the zero line. Looking at this indicator, we get the sense that there will be at least a slowing down of this world-wide movement of disinflation that was linked in particular to globalisation. Don’t forget that in any case we are reasoning ourselves medium term and what counts is the headline inflation in the medium term. From time to time headline inflation goes up or down, down or up, but what counts is the medium term. And from that standpoint I think it’s a bit too early to conclude in which direction the overall addition of the two risks – one downward risk and one upside risk – would go. I would say, at this stage, that this should not change drastically our understanding of what headline inflation will be in two years' time. That being said there is also short term volatility, which is again something we have pre-announced. There will be short-term volatility. To give you an example, in the euro area we are presently below 2 at the moment. We might very well be below 2 in one month’s time. I don’t exclude that possibility at all; we may even be lower, perhaps. We will see. Again I don’t make any projection. But I would not exclude either the fact that we may go upward again because, as I said, you have a number of phenomena that are due to the profile of the oil prices twelve months ago. At the end of the year inflation could very well be substantially over and above 2%, even without changing the present price of oil. So we can go up or down. I remember that I once explained in the past that we had a hump in inflation, but that this would go down over a short period of time, say three or four months. Then I tell you the contrary, I tell you that we have inflation which is low, perhaps even lower, but then it will go up again and that for arithmetical reasons that everybody can check. So be aware that short-term evolutions should not be considered important in the conduct of our policy when we have to cope with shocks because what counts is that our policy is driven in an eighteen-months’ to two-years’ perspective to deliver price stability in line with our definition. "
31/08/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates earlier this month. It has also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that upside risks to price stability are contained. With key ECB interest rates at still low levels in both nominal and real terms, money and credit growth dynamic, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative. If our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will remain warranted. Indeed, acting in a timely manner to contain risks to price stability remains essential to ensure that inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Turning first to the economic analysis, all the main indicators in the euro area that have recently become available for the first half of the year show a significant improvement in underlying economic activity and indicate that economic growth was stronger than previously projected by official and private forecasters. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP grew by 0.9% in the euro area in the second quarter of 2006, significantly above the 0.6% growth rate recorded in the previous quarter. In interpreting recent GDP data, due account needs to be taken of the degree of volatility of quarterly growth rates, but they generally confirm our view that economic growth is broadening and becoming more sustained. The information on activity in the third quarter – coming from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates – continues to be favourable and supports the assessment of real GDP growing at rates around potential. Looking forward, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to continue growing at around the potential rate. Global economic activity remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions improve further. This outlook is also reflected in the new ECB staff macroeconomic projections, which for the first time include Slovenia as part of the euro area projections for 2007. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.2% and 2.8% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2007. In comparison with the June Eurosystem staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2006 and 2007 have been revised upwards, mainly reflecting the stronger growth recorded in the first half of this year, along with continued positive signals from a number of other indicators. It is the Governing Council’s view that risks to these projections for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. Over the longer term, uncertainty has augmented and downside risks relate mainly to potential further oil price rises, global imbalances and protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks. With respect to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.3% in August 2006, compared with 2.4% in the previous month. During the second half of 2006, and on average also in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain elevated at above 2%, with the precise levels depending mainly on future energy price developments. While in our main scenario the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in the remainder of 2006 and in 2007 – partly reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector – lagged indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced increases in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year. In the new ECB staff projections, annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 2.3% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.9% and 2.9% in 2007. Compared with the June 2006 Eurosystem staff projections, the range for 2006 is within the upper part of the previous range, while that for 2007 has been shifted slightly upwards, largely reflecting the assumption of higher oil prices. In the view of the Governing Council, risks to this outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger than expected wage developments. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities, also in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment. Regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail continues to be confirmed by the monetary analysis. The rates of monetary and credit expansion remain rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area. In particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, with this rapid growth remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. The moderation of annual M3 growth observed in the past two months – to 8.5% in June and 7.8% in July – may possibly reflect the impact of previous increases in interest rates. However, it also needs to be viewed against the high growth rate witnessed in May, which represented one of the highest annual rates of M3 growth seen since the introduction of the euro. More generally, recent monetary developments should be assessed with the appropriate medium-term perspective, and thus against the background of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion observed since mid-2004. On this basis, liquidity in the euro area remains ample by all reasonable measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in the context of already ample liquidity points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, especially against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook continuing to be clearly on the upside. Given the ongoing dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Accordingly, strong vigilance is warranted in order to ensure that risks to price stability are contained. If our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation remains warranted. Acting in a timely manner will make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. As regards fiscal policy, in several Member States public finances appear to be on track to meet or even exceed this year’s targets as the favourable economic situation, revenue windfalls and effective consolidation measures exert a positive influence on fiscal balances. However, in other countries, the current fiscal outlook suggests a shortfall in terms of the required structural improvement in public finances. This is worrying in view of the objectives and commitments agreed under the revised Stability and Growth Pact. It is therefore essential that 2006 budgets are executed strictly during the remainder of this year, and that budget plans for 2007 and beyond are sufficiently ambitious. All countries should take advantage of the current economic recovery to consolidate fiscal balances. Especially countries in excessive deficit procedure and with a high debt-to-GDP ratio should use the current economic recovery to bring the public deficit ratio to below 3% within the agreed deadline, and more ambitious fiscal consolidation is essential to achieve the medium-term objectives. It is also crucial that comprehensive reform programmes strengthen economic incentives and enhance the sustainability of social security systems. This is the best contribution that fiscal policies can make towards building confidence in the outlook for growth and stability in the euro area and in the revised Stability and Growth Pact. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council stresses the need to raise the potential growth rate of the euro area, to foster incentives to work and to strengthen the euro area’s capacity to absorb shocks. Comprehensive reform measures to ensure a fully operational internal market, a higher degree of wage and price flexibility, and a more favourable business environment would offer new opportunities for firms and workers and promote investment, innovation and job creation. Such structural reforms would not only help to underpin the momentum of the ongoing economic recovery, but would also safeguard the standard of living of euro area citizens in the longer run. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * I will not comment more on that as it seems to me that we are clear enough. I have underlined the phrase “progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation”, and what has happened in the past seems to provide all the appropriate keys to understanding how we act. As I have said several times, we are in a posture of strong vigilance today. I also remind you that, as far as the medium term is concerned, we will do what is necessary. We do not pre-commit ex ante, neither to doing nor to not doing something. We are constantly alert. We do what is necessary. It is probably because observers, economists, and market participants understand this so well that we have succeeded until now in anchoring inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability. On the first point, Slovenia had no significant influence in these projections, taking into account Slovenia’s very small contribution to the overall consolidated GDP. As regards the sentiment surrounding the future medium-term decisions, again, we do not pre-commit ourselves in any respect. Our concept is very simple: we do what - in our opinion - is necessary to counter the inflationary risks that we see, to deliver price stability over the medium term and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. And, everything that we have done over time can be explained by this simple grid. I do not want to qualify in any other manner what we will do in the future, because, once again, we will do what we have to do in order to deliver price stability, be credible in the delivery of price stability over the medium term and continue anchoring inflationary expectations. First of all – this is very important although it is not new for you,– we contribute to sustainable growth and job creation as it is stated in the Introductory Statement by doing what is necessary to do. We would hamper growth, and not foster growth, if we were to abandon our mandate and if we were less credible in the delivery of price stability. This is clear. Second, as regards the projections, and also as a further response to the previous question, let me first say that it is the ECB staff projections which are being made public today. As you know, we are not ourselves in the Governing Council underwriting these projections. They are made by our ECB staff, with all of their professional excellence and their knowledge. These are the last projections to have been published after a number of other institutions’ projections. If you compare the various projections (IMF, OECD, Commission, our staff), you have to take into account the fact that they were not published at the same time. As far as the Governing Council is concerned, we are extracting all information and we have a sense of what the medium-term trend would be. When we had bad news – you will remember in particular that when the growth rate for the last quarter of last year was published, it was a disappointing figure, it was only 0.3% – I told you that it did not call into question our medium-term trend assessment. All the information which we were extracting and which is processed by the collegial wisdom of the Governing Council, led us to consider that we had to take into account this medium-term trend around potential – and yet we still had bad news. As a matter of fact when we increased rates in December you might remember that we did not have good news, because we had the immediate data relating to the last month of last year, which were not good. Now we have really very good figures for the first semester – that is clear enough – I would say the same. I would say that sometimes it is bad, sometimes it is very good. You have volatility, what I would call quarterly volatility of data, including GDP, which is major information. We extract all the information from that and our feeling is that it fully confirms our overall sentiment, which I have been explaining to you since the middle of last year. As regards growth we have to take into account, of course, the impact of the first semester, and that calls for the substantial arithmetic augmentation that you see in the staff projections. As regards inflation, I would say that the main driver of the upward revision of the inflation projections is oil and commodity prices. Unfortunately, this means that the materialisation of the risks associated with further increases of oil prices that we mentioned earlier is now being observed and this is crystallised in these projections. As regards the international environment, I said myself that uncertainties had augmented, and I would say that we are in a universe which is probably more uncertain than before. But at the present moment we consider that the central scenario, the baseline scenario, is still that we have a favourable overall global environment. The combination of what happens in the various continents will continue to be relatively favourable as regards the global demand, which is addressed to the euro area. That being said, we are in a universe of significant uncertainties, and the possible slowing down of the US economy does of course have an impact on us. But never forget, – and I don’t want to minimise the impact of the US economy on us at a global level, both directly and indirectly – that as regards trade links, the United Kingdom is more important for the euro area than the United States. And that is an observation that one does not necessarily bear in mind. Of course it also means that for the United Kingdom, the euro area is much more important than the United States. But we have a number of other uncertainties. I mentioned the imbalances and the price of oil and other commodities, and I could also mention geopolitical uncertainties. There are a number of elements, but with all things taken into account, with all elements integrated into our own understanding of the environment of the euro area, I would say that our ECB staff projections incorporate a relatively favourable global environment. As regards Germany it is absolutely clear that we are presently observing a very favourable episode. We also know that the first quarter of next year will be much less favourable for the reason that you have in mind – the VAT increases. We consider that afterwards we should go back to some kind of a more normal trend. To sum up integrating all elements including the ECB staff projections our own baseline scenario at the level of the Governing Council is that we see appropriate confirmation of our previous diagnosis. First of all, it was – as always – a very profound and deep discussion. All colleagues intervened, with the assets and liabilities of the situation being weighed up by all of us. I would say that the decision was unanimous. I will not comment on exchange rates, I would only say that each central bank in the world – whether it is in Japan, in the United States, in Sweden or in the United Kingdom and of course here – decides on the basis of its own responsibilities. We all have to deliver price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. We in the Governing Council are very proud of our present level of credibility in the euro area and we will do whatever is necessary to preserve, maintain and enhance this level of credibility, which is essential for us to deliver on our mandate. It is also essential to make the present episode of recovery – and I am speaking of the trend and not of quarterly data – sustainable and durable. To sum up some of the responsibilities that I see presently in Europe, that governments on top of their necessary sound and reasonable fiscal policies - and you know how essential these policies are in the long run for the sake of our children and grandchildren - need to implement structural reforms which would permit the “speed limit” of European growth to be elevated. The speed limit itself has to be elevated and that is why we always mention structural reforms as being of the essence Thanks to our own mandate of price stability and to the extent that we deliver price stability, we have a very important responsibility in permitting growth to be as close as possible to the speed limit and not to be volatile; in avoiding the stops and goes that are associated with inflation. On the first point, in view of the shocks that we have had to cope with, we can understand – and I said that today also – why for instance a large part of the new projections as regards inflation are explainable by the fact that assumptions on oil prices and commodity prices have changed. So we are permanently coping with this succession of shocks. That being said, only a few months ago we were at the level of 2%. At the moment I am speaking we are at the level of 3% and I said that we were in the posture of strong vigilance. You can see what conclusions we draw from the changes in our own assessment of the risks to price stability. As regards Italy, I would only say that Italy is one of those economies we have been mentioning that have to be fully in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and with the commitments that are associated with the Pact’s functioning. We consider that this is absolutely essential from all standpoints – from the standpoint of the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact, from the credibility of the country concerned and from the credibility of the euro area as a whole. Italy is one of the countries which has to do its homework fully in line with its previous commitments. I will not embark on long semantic explanations. I would say that “progressive” should be understood in the Anglo-Saxon, i.e. UK and US sense, and not necessarily what it implies when translated into other languages. I know that, for instance in German, or perhaps in Dutch or in other languages, it might mean an augmentation of the size of each decision, but it is not that meaning that we have in mind, it is the regular English meaning. But we have been using this word for quite some time now, and it is the first time this question is asked, so I take it for granted that almost everybody has understood what it means. As regards the methodological assumption, as you know for exchange rates the Eurosystem staff is photographing the situation of the exchange rate at the given deadline; and then go along the period and that would call for 1.28 in the present assumptions that are underlying the projections. No conclusion has to be drawn from that, it is only the methodological approach of the staff. As regards oil and other commodities, as you know the staff looks at the futures market and draws conclusions from what we see on that market. As regards interest rates, as you know, the methodology was recently changed a little bit. I do not think that it had a significant impact on the projections themselves, market expectations have been taken into account. As regards your second question what I call our baseline scenario refers to the overall sentiment of the Governing Council. But we do not have any other set of figures that would be different from the Eurosystem staff or from any other private or public projections. As you know, we make our judgement after having looked at all the information available – of course, great attention is given to the staff projections done on the basis of their best professional excellence and knowledge but we also look at all other information available and draw conclusions from this wealth of analysis and information. Our baseline scenario is that we have a trend, which is around potential, and we are reasoning medium term. And again, that scenario as regards growth has in our opinion been fully confirmed until now, taking into account that our environment which was at the beginning very sceptical. As regards inflationary risks, they are on the upside, and this is a sentiment which we also see fully confirmed by the information we have received. First of all, we do not have a price target, but a definition of price stability, which is below but close to 2%. We are not in the conceptual universe of inflation targeting. We have our own concept, as you know. Second, as you rightly say, most of the explanation we have for the new ranges is associated with the increases in the prices of oil and other commodities, which is very important. If we felt comfortable, I would not say that we are in a posture of strong vigilance. And that progressive alleviation of monetary accommodation would be warranted! I never pre-commit to any kind of level. At the same time I will not prevent you from having in mind some figures, but that is your responsibility. As far as we are concerned, we will do what is necessary to do in our own judgement. I have no other comments on that. The question is very pertinent, but my response is clear: we will do what is necessary to do. On the first point we will do what is necessary. In the past - and I have already referred to that- we increased rates in December with the most recent figures that were not very flattering. And it was proved that they were not very flattering when we got the results of the last quarter of last year. We have a needle in our compass which is price stability. And one should never depart from that: I have seen a number of questions implying that we have other needles, or that we have two compasses! No, we have only one. That needle of our own compass, which is our mandate, is extremely important because it permits us to be as close as possible to the speed limit of growth in the medium to long-run perspective and to diminish the volatility of output. That is very easily understood. For an experiment, imagine that we lose our credibility as far as inflationary expectations are concerned and look at what would immediately happen in a number of domains, including medium and long-term market interest rates! So, what we do, by being faithful to our mandate, is to foster sustainable, steady economic growth in the medium and long run and not to hamper it. What I say is not new and there is now very much a global consensus on that. That is why central banks are given the mandate of delivering price stability. It is the mandate of all inflation-targeters we see the world over – they have exactly the same single mandate. As regards the IMF meetings in Singapore, the Eurosystem and the ECB believe that we must have an appropriate presence which corresponds to our responsibility. We are one of the major institutions in the monetary field in the world. At the last participation I had in the various “Gs” – whether it is the G7, the G10, the G20 – or in the IFMC, we are being progressively given what I would call a more appropriate representation. This is a process which is going in the right direction. We would like that process to be more rapid, but I would not be negative on it, particularly in light of the last meetings I participated in. As regards our overall assumptions and those of our ECB staff, it is what comes out of the future market because that is the only objective way you can look at it. Of course, this has to be considered with a significant element of uncertainty. Therefore I would say that uncertainty in the oil and commodity markets is really something which is absolutely of the essence. The upward move of the ranges is very clearly associated with these dangers and risks. But I would not qualify the probability of realisation; and, to my knowledge, nobody does that, because, if I speak the language of economists and mathematicians, I would say that there is clearly an element of Knightian uncertainty in what can happen to this domain. As regards potential growth, we have a lot of analyses which are made by the OECD, by the IMF, by private institutions; we ourselves are working on that. We do not underwrite a precise figure, but what we see is that there is clearly an arithmetic understanding of what it means, which is very simple. You have demography on the one hand (ageing population, participation rate) and you have labour productivity growth on the other hand. And the combination of the two gives you some idea of what growth would be in the medium and long run. At least to the extent that you are reasonably sure of the demographic given and of the labour productivity input. And what is unfortunate in our case is that by all ways of understanding what is happening as regards productivity progress, we are at a very disappointing level. To sum up what I have in mind as a synthesis of all information of a large array of analyses, I would say that today I mean over the last five years or even the last ten years – the level of approximately a yearly increase of labour productivity is half the level we had in the euro area in the 1980s and half the level observed since 1996 or 2000 in the United States. So, clearly, if we were back to the labour productivity progress that we had in the 1980s, we would grow much more and growth potential would be superior to the present one by more than 1%. And if we could benefit from the same gross labour productivity progress as is observed in the United States we would have a growth potential again more than 1% higher than the present one. That of course brings me back to the structural reforms, which are absolutely of essence. There is a large consensus amongst economists who consider that the main reasons for these differentials, which are considerable, are associated with the flexibility of a number of economies on the one hand, including the United States, and the absence of flexibility of all markets on this side of the Atlantic. This is not to say that we have only liabilities and difficulties and counter-productive features in Europe and in the euro area, but it is clear that this is our main problem and we have to work a lot on that. On long-term interest rates, I do not want to pronounce myself on the United States, and the person best qualified to respond to your question as regards the other side of the Atlantic is Ben Bernanke. But I would say that it seems to me that there are a number of economists who are concentrating only on the predictive capacity over the cycle of the slope of the yield curve. And I am not sure that it is exactly appropriate in the present period: first of all we have a number of other indicators that are also supposed to predict future episodes in the cycle and they are not at all giving the same indications. Also as regards the exante levels of savings and investment in the world economy, on top of all that has been said already, on the level of savings in Asia and in the emerging economies in general and also on the behaviour of corporate businesses in the industrialised world – which is perhaps, in terms of investment, at least until now more cautious and prudent than before – we have the oil element; and the oil element not only triggers consequences as regards the inflationary risk but also simultaneously produces a level of additional “forced savings” in a world which is far superior to what we had observed before. And this of course is an element which might make it possible to explain why financial markets are under the influence of this very abundant supply of additional savings. Objectively it will not last necessarily forever, at least the augmentation of this forced saving will not continue forever, we are absolutely sure of that. At the level of the Governing Council we look at the overall situation of the 313 million people and very soon the 315 million people in the euro area because we already have our new friends from Slovenia amongst us. At that level, we see a very dynamic element and a problem - even if in Germany there is no such feature, although it is changing a little bit. As regards various individual countries, there are some where we have an extraordinarily dynamic real estate sector. It is important that all is done at the national level in those countries in the euro area to try to cool down this abnormal sectoral behaviour. Communication and explanation can be of help in this respect. All executive branches and surveillance authorities have to take this into consideration in their own day-to-day exercise of their responsibility. It is a real issue and problem which has to be coped with. "
03/08/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to this press conference to report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. At today’s meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. It will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. As stressed on previous occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Also after today’s increase, the key ECB interest rates remain low in both real and nominal terms, money and credit growth remain strong, and liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Our monetary policy therefore continues to be accommodative. If our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be warranted. Against this background, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The main indicators of economic activity that have become available since the July press conference have tended to confirm our baseline scenario for economic growth in the euro area. Eurostat’s second release verified that, in the first quarter of 2006, real GDP grew by 0.6% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Economic activity is also becoming more broadly based on domestic demand. Moreover, the currently available information on economic activity in the second quarter – such as various confidence surveys and monthly indicators – supports the view that economic growth has continued at a sustained pace. The survey information so far available for the third quarter is also in line with our baseline scenario. Looking further ahead, the conditions are in place for real GDP in the euro area to grow at around its potential rate, as projected by Eurosystem staff in June. Growth in the economies of the euro area’s main trading partners is providing ongoing support for euro area exports. Investment growth is expected to continue benefiting from favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring, and improvements in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should continue to strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in employment growth and hence real disposable income. This generally favourable outlook for economic activity in the euro area is also reflected in forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions. Risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, although recent geopolitical tensions and their impact on markets are a timely reminder of the uncertainties that we face. Medium to longer-term risks lie on the downside and relate in particular to the potential for further oil price rises, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha Round of trade talks. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in July 2006, unchanged from June and May. In the second half of 2006 and on average in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, the precise levels depending very much on future energy price developments. While the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007 – also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector – indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger than expected wage and price developments owing to second-round effects of past oil price increases at a time of gradually improving labour markets. Regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail is confirmed by the monetary analysis. While the data for June 2006 show some moderation in the annual growth rate of M3, these latest developments remain consistent with a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion since mid-2004. The stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates in the euro area has been an important factor behind the tendency for money and credit growth to strengthen over recent quarters. Looking at the counterparts of M3, the expansion of credit to the private sector remains the main driver of monetary dynamics. On an annual basis, loans to the private sector as a whole have continued to increase at double-digit rates over recent months, with borrowing both by households and by non-financial corporations rising rapidly. Ongoing strong lending to households continues to be explained, in particular, by borrowing for house purchases. The dynamic growth of money and credit, in an environment of already ample liquidity, points to increased upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, particularly in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets. To sum up, annual inflation rates are expected to remain elevated, at above 2% on average, in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook on the upside. Given strong monetary and credit growth in a context of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. A further adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted. By acting today in a timely fashion, the Governing Council is helping to anchor medium and long-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. Looking ahead, given that our monetary policy continues to be accommodative, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be warranted if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed. The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. Concerning fiscal policies, given the outlook for economic growth, it is of crucial importance that euro area governments avoid pro-cyclical policies and step up the pace of fiscal consolidation. As budgetary targets for the current year are not particularly ambitious, a rigorous implementation of plans on the expenditure side is especially warranted, and any additional windfall revenues are best used for deficit reduction. Beyond the implementation of such prudent policies in the remainder of this year, the medium-term focus of fiscal policies should be on correcting the underlying sources of imbalances in public finances. Euro area governments, many of which are now finalising their budget plans for 2007, should take full advantage of the economic environment to bring forward the structural adjustment necessary for the durable correction of excessive deficits, so as to reach their medium-term budgetary objectives at an early stage and thereby prepare public finances for the acute demographic challenges they must cope with. As regards structural reforms, it is essential, for Europe’s future, to ensure that it has a fully operational Internal Market, allowing a free flow of labour and capital and free trade in goods and services. Removing the remaining barriers within the EU will be a powerful means to promote the efficient allocation of factors of production as well as deeper economic and financial integration. This in turn would allow the EU to realise its substantial potential for stronger output and employment growth and to increase its resilience to shocks. Exploiting the opportunities of the Single Market will help to safeguard the prosperity of the citizens of Europe. For those Member States which have fulfilled the convergence criteria laid down by the Treaty and participate in the euro area, the considerable benefits of the Internal Market are further enhanced by the single currency, which offers them a credible framework for monetary policy and price stability in an environment characterised by the absence of exchange rate uncertainty within the euro area, low long-term interest rates, price and cost transparency, reduced transaction and information costs and stronger insurance against economic and financial instability. In this respect, the further enlargement of the euro area on 1 January 2007 with the entry of Slovenia will be a new historical landmark. In order to fully reap the advantages of the euro and to allow adjustment mechanisms to operate efficiently within the enlarged currency area, it will be necessary to fully integrate Slovenia into Economic and Monetary Union, which calls for all remaining barriers to be removed, including those related to labour mobility. Indeed, open, competitive and flexible markets are of particular importance for the functioning of the euro area economy and the smooth conduct of the single monetary policy. For its part, the Governing Council has undertaken all the necessary preparations to make Banka Slovenije an integral part of the Eurosystem. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * I stick to what I said in my introductory statement. As you heard, it is our sentiment that if our baseline scenario is confirmed, we will progressively withdraw the present monetary accommodation. That is clearly the way we are looking at the situation and also the way that observers are looking at the situation. I do not want to say anything else, but we will continue to monitor the situation very closely. I will not comment on your own hypothesis. I will not comment on the decision of the Bank of England, which happened to be on exactly the same day. As regards our own decision, it was not unexpected. And as regards the way we look at the future, it has been absolutely clear since the very beginning of our first move in December last year that we do not decide ex-ante future decisions over the medium run. I said that we were not pre-committed to any two months, three months or any kind of rhythm. I have always myself said that we depend on the confirmation of our baseline scenario, on facts and figures. We will see what will be the judgement of the Governing Council when the time comes. Again we are not pre-committed in any respect. We will do all what we judge appropriate, depending again on the wealth of information that we have, coming from our own analysis and the very impressive wealth of information and analysis from public and private institutions. As regards the position of central banks in general, as far as you refer not only to us, but to the community of central banks, I would say that we all consider that being credible in our mandate to deliver price stability not only on a short-term basis, but on the medium and long-term basis, and therefore, solidly anchoring inflationary expectations, is of the essence. It is the trust of all central banks I know, and certainly of those with which I am in permanent contact. It is of course, as you know well, our very strong belief. We have a mandate, we are faithful to our mandate and we believe that it is the best way to help growth to be sustainable and job creation which, very fortunately, is now visible, sustainable in the medium and long run. As I said, we depend permanently on new information. I also mentioned the fact that we live in a world where uncertainty, and indeed great uncertainty, is unavoidable. This is particularly the case as regards the geopolitical risks that I mentioned. I would say that on a short to medium-term basis, the risks to growth are in our opinion balanced. On a longer-term horizon, we see a number of downward risks. That is the best summing-up of our present view. On the particular impact of geopolitical risks, I do not see, at this very moment that these have contributed in any significant fashion to hampering growth. But it is clearly a risk that has to be taken into consideration. Fortunately, I have not seen, and I hope strongly not to see, an impact of these events on global growth. On your first question, I already said, that we are not pre-committed in any respect. We do what we judge to be appropriate and necessary, and I think that the market has understood that pretty well. There is no particular rhythm of three or two months. We are not pre-committed as regards the frequency of our progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation, if facts and figures confirm our baseline scenario. And we will continue to behave in this fashion. I will not comment on financial stability. I do not see any element that would be significant at this stage. On M3, as I said, we have observed a certain signal which, of course, is difficult to interpret at this time. The decisions we took since December as well as the fact that the market is anticipating our decisions, and that the yield curve is showing an upward trend, all this has played a role. Is it a sufficiently significant influence to trigger what we are observing now and mark the beginning of a deceleration? We will see. Of course, I prefer what we have observed in the latest statistics to the previous evolution. Note the figures are still very impressive. When you look at the figures we have, particularly as regards loans to the private sector, loans to non-financial corporations – which are increasing at a pace of 11.5% in June, compared with 11.3% in May – we still have very strong dynamics. And the pace continues to increase as regards that particular segment of loans, even if loans to the private sector in general decreased slightly to 11% in June from 11.4% in May. But again it is something that we will continue to look at very carefully. Look at the components of M3. Look at its counterparts. And you will better understand all the dynamics that are at stake. Again I will not, at this stage, say “we now clearly see the first signs that what we have been doing in increasing our interest rates is working”. But our policy changes are, of course, playing a role because the interest rates applied by the banks that are granting those loans are rising. First of all, the decision in favour of a 25 basis point increase today was overwhelmingly supported by the Governing Council. As regards our assessment of the risks to price stability and to growth I have told you clearly that we saw the risks to price stability over the short, medium and long term to be on the upside. We consider the risks for growth to be balanced, on a short to medium-term basis, and to be on the downside over the longer term. That is our present analysis. That being said our mandate is clear. We have to deliver price stability. It is not only the mandate given to us by the Treaty but also our responsibility vis-à-vis the households of Europe and the fellow citizens of Europe, who expect us to deliver price stability. It is also the working assumption of the social partners. And this is the reason why we tell them: be responsible yourself, because we will take care of price stability. It is also essential because it is through our credibility that we anchor inflationary expectations. As I said in my introductory statement in the euro area we have long-term rates that are favourable to sustainable growth and sustainable job creation, in particular, because we are solidly anchoring inflationary expectations. We see no contradiction between our mandate and sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. On the first point, I mentioned the risks that we saw to prices and I mentioned a number of those risks – such as the increase in the price of oil – which we have observed in the past, unfortunately, I have to say, and which are still a risk. I mentioned additional increases in prices – I am not mentioning past increases that have already been decided and fully incorporated in our own projections, but rather the possible future increases in administrative prices and indirect taxes – and I mentioned the traditional – in this press conference – second-round effects, in particular wages and salaries increases. There is also the point which you have mentioned, which we consider ourselves to be very important and which has to be examined very carefully, namely what we call a stronger than currently anticipated pass-through of past oil prices and I could add of past commodity prices. There are increases in input prices that do not materialise immediately in increases in output prices, in manufacturing goods or in the services prices concerned, but this process is going on, on a continuing basis and that is something which has to be followed very carefully. That would be my comment on your first question. Just because you don’t see an immediate effect, an immediate mechanistic effect of these increases in oil and commodities prices, that does not mean that you do not have in the pipeline costs that would push prices up later on. This is difference from the second-round effects. On the fiscal side, I would only say that we have always told our interlocutors, the Commission and the executive branches, that in delivering the appropriate fiscal position required by the Stability and Growth Pact, in an overwhelming majority of cases, to be as sound and reasonable as possible on the expenditure side is the first best option. Then, if something remains to be done, in order to meet this Stability and Growth Pact requirement, you have to do what remains necessary on the receipt side, namely taxation. But the first best option is always to have a sound handling of the expenditure side. There is nothing new there; we have always said that. And I have to say that it is particularly true in the euro area, where the level of public expenditure – public spending as a proportion of GDP – is quite significantly higher than the OECD average or the G7 average. So we have to be fully conscious of that structural difference. As regards Slovenia, of course we are very happy to be enlarging the euro area and we will have a fully fledged set of statistics that will permit a full comparison of what happens from 1 January next year with what has happened before. So, you will have all possibilities to compare statistics of the highest quality on a state of the art professional basis. But allow me to stress that we an important message in relation with Slovenia. Perhaps you have noticed that we said that we will be, when next year starts, in a euro area with 13 economies instead of 12 sharing a common destiny with a single currency. We consider that it would be very opportune for labour mobility between Slovenia and the European Union and in particular with all the members of the euro area, to be totally free without barrier within a single market area with a single currency, full labour mobility is absolutely necessary. Let me be more precise. By “overwhelming majority” I meant a fully-fledged consensus. There were no other views on today’s decision. First of all, the “normal level” for us is the level which permits us to deliver price stability over time, be credible in the delivery of price stability over time and solidly anchor inflationary expectations. There is our compass and the needle of the compass. Second, as I have said very often, we are pragmatic. Everybody knows what our definition of price stability is. Everybody knows what our determination is. Everybody knows what our two-pillar monetary policy strategy is. Now, we will do what is necessary, depending on facts and figures and new events. At this stage, I will not comment further. Of course, we will have new projections, as you might expect. We have our present projections. We have our baseline scenario and we might have a lot of new events – price of oil, geopolitical uncertainty, also good surprises that we might have in the rest of the world. We could also be – I do not exclude that at all – surprised by the dynamism of the domestic economy of the euro area. We have a number – as you know very well, better than anybody – of survey indicators that are very impressive and that are still not materialising fully – particularly in the services sector, where the survey indicators are much better than the present so-called hard figures. I do not believe that hard figures are the only reliable figures or that survey figures are the only reliable figures. We have to make the best out of this wealth of information, but it is clear that there are areas where we could have good surprises. Again, even if I said that our own sentiment for growth was balanced on a short-term basis, it means that we have downside risks on the one hand, but we have also upside chances on the other hand. And we have to take that into consideration also. That being said, you can count on us to do what we judge necessary. If our baseline scenario is confirmed, if our assumptions are confirmed, then we will progressively withdraw monetary accommodation. You know that there are a number of analyses which do not converge in the direction of an overall consensus on our growth potential. And you have also to distinguish the short-term growth potential, and the medium and long-term growth potential. Let me first address the very important issue of labour productivity increases. I would like to take advantage of your question, which is extraordinarily important, to mention the fact that our main handicap in terms of growth potential remains the fact that productivity growth is much too small in the euro area. During the last five years, say, we have been at a level which is half the level observed in the United States in terms of the yearly increase of labour productivity and which is also half the level observed in the economies of the euro area in the eighties. If we were at the level that we had in the eighties, or if we were at the level which is presently posted by the United States, we would have a growth potential which would be significantly higher. This is the reason why we are calling for structural reforms, because we firmly believe that it is the lack of structural reforms particularly in a period of very rapid changes in science, technology, and globalisation, that explains why we have a disappointing level of increase of labour productivity. That being said, you asked for figures. We will not underwrite any figures ourselves. But I can mention a number of studies which suggest that, for the euro area as a whole, we could be at the level of 1.9%. Others suggest that we are in-between 2% and 2.5%, but possibly much closer to 2% than to 2.5%. You have a number of such analyses. And again, I will not underwrite any figures, but I would say that if you said in the present situation that perhaps 2% might be an order of magnitude it would not necessarily be absurd. But, again, one has to accept there are various methodologies, various views – short-term and more medium and long-term. In any case, our growth potential should be much higher. It is not a parameter which is fixed and immobile. It depends on what we do. And it can be much higher. My memory is that I mentioned a figure of around 1.9. Taking the second question first. You know that we consider that fiscal consolidation – at the present level of the risks and dangers that exist in the various economies of the euro area today – is improving the confidence of entrepreneurs, the confidence of economic agents in general and the confidence of households. All the mechanistic computations that would go through mechanistic models are not necessarily reliable, because they do not take into account what I would call the Ricardian channel. Never forget that, when you are credible in a medium-term path of fiscal consolidation, you are improving confidence. And confidence is one of the ingredients that is decisive to foster growth: fortunately, we are in an episode of improving confidence in Europe. On your first question, I would say that we are totally pragmatic: we will see what happens. I have no judgement on whether some survey indicators have peaked or not. I have mentioned that, particularly in the domain of services, we still see a large gap between the level of survey indicators, which is very flattering and very encouraging, and the level of the so-called hard figures. My intuition is that the hard figures themselves will go up. But we will see what happens, and again, we have to be cautious. Reality is reality, facts are facts, and we have to be humble in front of facts. Therefore I have no comment on whether some survey indicators have peaked or not. But, as you know, some of them are at historical levels which are very flattering. Again, I have said all I have to say on that. I can only confirm to you that, if our scenario and our assumptions are confirmed, there will be a progressive alleviation of the monetary accommodation that exists today. I have said that for quite a period of time, and you can see what we have been doing. Let me also mention something which has been discussed in the Governing Council, namely the Doha round. You did not ask many questions on this issue but it is very important for us. We have always said that a positive conclusion of this round was of the essence. The fact that we are in a difficult episode is something that we follow very carefully. We consider that it is one of the risks that I have constantly mentioned. I would call on all governments concerned to be fully aware of what is at stake in this round of negotiations and to make their best efforts to cope with the current difficulties and to find a solution. "
06/07/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has confirmed that a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation was warranted to contain upside risks to price stability. Indeed, acting in a timely manner to contain such risks remains essential to ensure that inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. With key ECB interest rates at still low levels in both nominal and real terms, money and credit growth dynamic, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative. Therefore, if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation remains warranted. Against this background, we will exercise strong vigilance so as to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Turning first to the economic analysis, the latest data and survey releases remain positive and, in general, have improved further. On balance, this confirms our assessment that economic growth has both regained momentum and become more broadly based and sustained in the first half of 2006. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for continued economic growth at rates around potential, despite possible volatility in the quarterly figures. Global economic activity remains strong, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to pick up, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions improve further. This broadly favourable outlook for economic activity is also reflected in the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions. The risks to the outlook for economic growth appear to be balanced over the shorter term, while in the longer term downside risks prevail, relating mainly to potential further oil price rises, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and potential pressures for increased protectionism. With respect to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in June 2006, the same rate as in May and compared with 2.4% in April. During the second half of 2006, and on average in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, the precise levels depending on future energy price developments. This assessment is supported by the Eurosystem staff projections and available public and private sector forecasts. While the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007 – also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector – indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year. Against this background, and also in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently expected, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes and, more fundamentally, stronger than expected wage and price developments due to second-round effects of past oil price increases. Regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail is confirmed by the monetary analysis. Money and credit growth have strengthened further over recent quarters, with the latest annual growth rate of M3 increasing to 8.9% in May – the highest annual growth of M3 since the start of Stage Three of EMU. The stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates in the euro area remains an important driving factor behind the high trend rate of monetary expansion. On an annual basis, loans to the private sector as a whole have continued to increase at double-digit rates over recent months, with borrowing both by households and by non-financial corporations rising rapidly. Ongoing strong lending activity to households continues to be explained, in particular, by borrowing for house purchases, which has stood at an annual rate of above 12% in recent months. The dynamic growth of money and credit, in an environment of already ample liquidity, points to increased upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Monetary developments, therefore, require enhanced monitoring, particularly in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook continuing to be on the upside. Given the dynamism of monetary growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will exercise strong vigilance so as to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. In terms of fiscal policy, the overall pace of consolidation is disappointing against the background of the favourable outlook for growth. Consolidation targets continue to be at risk, notably in a number of countries with an excessive deficit. The Governing Council therefore reiterates its position that it is crucial to avoid the mistakes of the past. It also wishes to express its broad agreement with the main fiscal challenges as generally identified by the European Commission. These concern, in particular, the need for a rigorous implementation of the revised Stability and Growth Pact with a view to speeding up fiscal consolidation and improving the outlook for fiscal sustainability. This needs to be underpinned by medium term-oriented structural reform strategies and appropriate national fiscal institutions and procedures. Finally, reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics remain essential for the European fiscal framework. Meeting these challenges will support confidence in the soundness of public finances and in economic prospects in Europe. As regards structural reforms, enhancing the growth potential of the euro area, increasing job opportunities and strengthening the euro area’s ability to cope with the challenges of globalisation are among the most demanding economic policy issues of our time. In order to translate the opportunities brought about by globalisation – in terms of higher living standards – into achievements, the euro area would greatly benefit from more flexible labour and product markets. It would also gain from a more favourable business environment and a fully fledged internal market – including in the services sector – that foster innovation, investment and the creation of new firms. Indeed, implementing the necessary reforms in a decisive manner would both help to reap the benefits that globalisation and the single market offer our citizens and raise the production capacity of our economy. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * The first question is very direct! I will let you make your own assessment. You will certainly have noted that I mentioned “strong vigilance” and I will let you draw your own conclusions from that. I would also add that we decided today that we would meet physically on 3 August. The possible announcement that we meet by teleconference is usually made the Friday before the meeting, but next time we will in fact meet physically. In this meeting we will examine all new information available during the present month. You know that all our decisions are conditional on facts and on figures and I have said this sufficiently frequently for you to be fully aware of this. Again we will look at all the information available and make our decision accordingly. I have always said that we are never pre-committed unconditionally. We take the decision that we judge appropriate on the basis of our analysis and all the information we have. It is the contrary. We feel that by doing what we do and by being very attentive to maintaining the strong anchoring of inflationary expectations, we are helping economic growth to be sustainable. We are making a major contribution to the achievement of sustainable economic growth. And I think it is the right way of looking at what we have been doing in the past and at what we may do in the future, based on our own analysis and judgement of the facts and figures. I would therefore repeat that it is exactly the contrary of what your question was implicitly suggesting. I have no particular message for any particular investor in Greece. As you know, we are looking at the full body of the euro area, namely 313 million people, a little bit higher, but it’s the same order of magnitude as the United States. It’s an immense, vast continental economy and it is at that level that we have an analysis of the increase in outstanding loans for financing housing. I mentioned the figure of 12% in the introductory statement. So it is clear that it is one of the elements that we looked at carefully. On the idea of changing the definition of price stability, it is totally absurd and we will certainly not do it. It will be the best way of destabilising the European economy by changing dramatically and disanchoring inflationary expectations. So you can count on our very inflexible attitude as regards the definition of price stability for the benefit of European growth and confidence in Europe, particularly confidence of households, which at their level, everywhere in Europe are sending us a very clear message: maintain price stability. And we will be fulfilling our mandate in this respect. On your second question, I have nothing to add to what I have already said. I have the highest esteem for Mr Juncker, who is a very, very good president of the Eurogroup. I will look very carefully at what will happen on Sunday. It will be a magnificent match. I have no doubt about that. I will not be present physically but I will look at it very carefully. I was present in Frankfurt on the occasion of the match between Brazil and France. And it was a beautiful match. But as always, que le meilleur gagne! ( May the best team win!) Let me say that I will not draw any conclusion from the fact that the four best teams in the world all belong to the euro area. But if anybody across the Atlantic or across the Channel wants to stress that, well, after all it would be their own decision, but I will not make an argument out of that. On the first question, it seems to me that I have already responded. We will take all decisions without any pre-commitment. All decisions that we will judge appropriate in order to maintain price stability and to ensure that we continue to have a solid anchoring of inflationary expectations. We have to cope with a succession of shocks; I mentioned the oil shock previously and our monetary policy is entirely designed to avoid the second-round effects that would destabilise this delivery of price stability in the medium term. This is very important and we consider that risks are on the upside. On financial market volatility we have looked at this phenomenon. We look at it in an ongoing fashion. I would say that it is clear that it needs very close monitoring. It is also clear that we had already diagnosed a degree of underpricing of risks in the financial markets in general, observed in particular as regards spreads, as regards risks premia. One can interpret what has happened as some kind of repricing of risks: that would go in the direction that we had more or less suggested because we were not that happy with the previous very low level of assessment of risks. At this stage, I would say that some correction has been observed. We have to remain careful and to monitor future developments closely. Again we never pre-commit ex ante – neither on the pace, nor on the quantum. The markets have observed us in the past and they have drawn their conclusions. But we proved in Madrid that we could increase rates also outside of Frankfurt. We are not trapped in any kind of pre-committed pace or rhythm. That being said, we act when we judge it to be appropriate to act. Today, taking into account all of the elements, we judged that it was not appropriate to act. We will see what happens next time we meet. Yes, very much. As regards your first question, there was an overwhelming sentiment that it was appropriate to meet physically for our meeting at the beginning of August. As regards divergences, I prefer the expression “diversities” because, in our analysis, the diversity that we observe in the vast continental European economy is of the order of magnitude of the diversity that we observe in the vast continental US economy, as regards growth, inflation and a number of other key parameters. So, what marks the European economy is much more the persistence of differences than diversity itself. In that respect, we have already said several times that this had to be looked at very carefully and that, in some cases, the persistence of diversity was a good thing, permitting corrections and adjustments that are or were necessary or even overdue, whereas in other cases, it would call for corrections. If, for instance, a country and an economy have unit labour costs that are going faster than the average in the euro area, with a competitive position that is already not flattering, and with external accounts that are displaying negative signals, such as important trade deficit and current account deficit, then we would certainly call for appropriate progressive correction – so that those unit labour costs move not over and above the average, but lower than the average – in order to progressively restore appropriate relative cost-competitiveness. That being said, I think that it is normal that one observes a large deal of diversity when dealing with more than 313 million people today, and more tomorrow. As regards consumption, we will see exactly what happens. Our analysis is that there are elements for consumption to continue picking up. We will see. I will not comment again because I did that already in the past on the impact of VAT and the speeding-up of consumption before the impact of VAT and then the slowing-down. It is clear that there will be some kind of boom-bust profile, which would be normal and is anticipated by all institutions and observers. On the 50 basis points, no, there is no sentiment that we should do something different from the previous decisions we took, although we of course remain fully free as I have always said. We will see what we do on 3 August, and I do not want to say anything except that we will look very carefully at all the elements, we will meet physically and there will be a press conference. Our sentiment is that it would certainly be useful in the circumstances to meet physically, which permits us to have interaction which is more profound than in a teleconference. However, we have a lot of teleconferences in the course of the year, something of which you are perhaps not fully aware, and decisions are always possible via teleconference. For instance, we have approved a number of convergence reports, which had been very carefully and professionally prepared, by teleconference and reached a number of decisions. I will not comment on any acceleration of the pace of our progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation if our baseline scenario is confirmed. You know the way in which we are looking at the future: any interpretation in terms of ex ante decision to change in any respect the rhythm of our withdrawal of monetary accommodation would not be correct. Again we do not take ex ante positions. We take the facts and figures as they are and our monetary and economic analysis as they are when we meet. Again, we will decide when we meet. We are outside our concept of not committing ex ante. So, “progressively” meaning to the extent that we see our baseline scenario developing according to our own projections and scenario, then we will progressively withdraw monetary accommodation in order to permanently keep inflationary risks under control. This is necessary for us to deliver price stability in the medium run, for inflationary expectations to be firmly anchored and for growth and job creation to be sustainable. As you know, job creation has been quite substantial in the recent period, and we are very happy about that. It has to be sustainable, and we have to take care that the recovery is sustainable. I would certainly confirm very solemnly to you that Governor Fukui is regarded as a great professional and held in very high esteem, not only by myself, but also by all his colleagues in the Community of central bankers. It is not only the case in the industrial world: it is also the case globally. I am therefore absolutely sure that monetary policy decisions, as they have been done in the past, will continue, in the future, to be taken according to the good and appropriate professional guidance from Governor Fukui without any other consideration. As you know, we look at it very carefully. I mentioned it very clearly myself in the introductory statement on behalf of the Governing Council. We have not done so now or recently, but have done it for a long period of time, and our strategy has two pillars! I therefore entirely agree with you that it had to be looked at very carefully, not only at our level, but at the global level. In this respect, the last BIS report was very interesting to read carefully. You might remember that we increased rates against a lot of recommendations. I have been questioned a great deal about that: Why you are raising rates when the IMF is telling you not to raise rates? Why are you raising rates when the OECD is telling you not to raise rates? Why are you raising rates when doubts are being expressed in market literature? It was because we thought that the monetary analysis and the economic analysis, as well as the cross-checking of the economic analysis with the monetary analysis, was calling for an increase in rates. We are not behind the curve; we are doing exactly what we judge to be appropriate. That being said, we will continue to monitor all information very closely and to be as pertinent as possible in our economic analysis and our cross-checking with the monetary analysis. And we are not behind the curve. As regards the euro and the dollar, I will stick to the G7 Communiqué that was published at our last meeting in Washington. When I have a message to deliver, I deliver it. It is as simple as that. As to your other point, I will certainly not comment any further, as I have already said everything that I have to say about the future. I credit you with a lot of cleverness and intelligence and I do not think you need any other information. I know of course that there are permanent comparisons with our friends across the Atlantic... Then, we have not changed anything in our concept of communication. Those who have been here for a long period of time know that we have always had the same principle. We have not changed; we have not changed recently; we did not change a long time ago. You can draw whatever conclusion you want to draw from the words I used today. I will let you draw any conclusion you want from that. But if you look at what we have said in the past, you will see that from time to time we have said that, and you and your colleagues are free, of course, to draw any conclusion from that. Our concept of communication is clear: as I have always said, we are not pre-committed; we do not decide ex ante on sequencing; we decide on the basis of our own concept of monetary policy, in the view of facts and figures. Now, it is up to you to draw the appropriate conclusion from the words that are in the introductory statement and those that I use in this session. Until now, it seems to me, these have been quite well understood. Everything that goes in the direction of convergence, in the direction of fiscal soundness, is of course welcome. We will see, when the time comes, whether the convergence, the economic “rapprochement” will operate effectively. We ourselves hope that Poland will go as far as possible in this direction. We believe that it is in the interests of Poland taking into account the Treaty and the fact that the euro area is open to Poland, as well as to all other friends, provided they meet the Maastricht criteria, provided they have converged sufficiently, and taking into account the fact that they have no opt-out clause, which we are happy about. Well, we will have a number of new figures. Do you want me to give you all the new information that we normally have in the month of July? Not all of it? Well, amongst many, many, we will have the Commission confidence indicators for July, which will come on 31 July; we will have a number of indicators of industrial production on 17 July; we will have the PMI on 1 August; we will have… So again, facts and figures, as always … Thank you very much indeed. "
08/06/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Madrid. I would particularly like to thank Governor Caruana for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to the staff of the Banco de España for their excellent organisation. Let me now report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today’s meeting, we decided to increase the  key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that have been identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. The further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will thus contribute to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. As stressed on previous occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Overall, also after today’s increase, the key ECB interest rates are still low by historical standards, liquidity is ample and our monetary policy remains accommodative. Given the outlook for price developments and the dynamism of money and credit growth in the euro area, we will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. All the main indicators of economic activity that have recently become available are positive. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP grew by 0.6% in the euro area in the first quarter of 2006, compared with 0.3% in the previous quarter, with domestic demand making a significant contribution. The expected re-acceleration of real GDP growth in the first months of 2006 has thus materialised, confirming our view that economic growth is broadening and becoming more sustained. This assessment is further supported by information on activity in the second quarter – such as various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates – which continues to be encouraging. Looking further ahead, the conditions are in place for growth in the euro area to remain close to its trend potential rate, despite the impact of the rise in oil prices. Growth in the economies of the euro area’s main trading partners remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. Strong investment growth is expected to continue, benefiting from favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring, and gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should continue to strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves. This outlook is also reflected in the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which provide additional input into our analysis of the prospects for economic activity. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.8% and 2.4% in 2006, and between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2007. The growth projections for 2006 are broadly unchanged from the ECB staff projections of March 2006, while those for 2007 are slightly lower, reflecting mainly the recent rise in oil prices. Most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions give a broadly similar picture. It is the Governing Council’s view that risks to these projections for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, while longer-term downside risks relate mainly to potential further oil price rises, global imbalances and protectionism. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation increased to 2.5% in May, compared with 2.4% in April and 2.2% in March. Although no detailed information is available as yet, this increase probably stems from energy price developments. In the months to come and in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, the precise levels depending on future energy price developments. While the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007 – also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector – indirect effects of past oil price increases and the announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to have a significant upward effect on inflation. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Further input into our assessment of the outlook for price developments is provided by the June Eurosystem staff projections. Annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 2.1% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007. Compared with the March 2006 ECB staff projections, these ranges imply a slight upward shift to the profile for HICP inflation in 2006, largely reflecting the assumption of higher oil prices. In the view of the Governing Council, risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger than expected wage developments due to second-round effects of past oil price increases. Turning to the monetary analysis, the Governing Council again had a thorough discussion of underlying developments in money and credit. In a context of already ample liquidity and very strong monetary and credit growth, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has increased further in recent months to reach double-digit levels. Credit growth has also been broadly based across sectors. Borrowing by households – especially for house purchase – and by non-financial corporations has been growing very strongly. At the same time, monetary growth has risen further over the past few months, with the annual growth rate of M3 standing at 8.8% in April. The rapid rate of monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components. Thus, the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion, which signals inflationary risks over the medium to longer term. The further acceleration of monetary and credit growth in this environment of already ample liquidity points to increased upside risks to price stability at longer horizons. Monetary developments, therefore, require careful monitoring, in particular in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook on the upside. Given the strength of monetary and credit growth and the ample liquidity situation, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability over the medium term prevail. A further adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted. By acting in a timely fashion, the Governing Council is helping to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. Overall, our monetary policy remains accommodative and the Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. With regard to fiscal policies, the forecasts published recently by the Commission point to a broadly unchanged situation in the euro area in 2006 and 2007; deficit ratios are expected to remain at around the 2005 level of 2.4%, while debt ratios, after declining only marginally, are forecast at levels still above 70% of GDP. This is disappointing against the background of the economic outlook. Most countries with an excessive deficit have not corrected their position in a timely manner. Furthermore, there is a risk of consolidation delays in other countries. It is crucial to avoid the mistakes of the past, when many countries failed to consolidate sufficiently in good times. The Governing Council considers that more determined progress is required towards sound public finances in a number of countries, that concrete and credible measures should be implemented swiftly as part of a medium-term-oriented strategy, and that it is vital to consolidate confidence in the revised Stability and Growth Pact by ensuring the sustainability of public finances in the euro area. In terms of structural reforms, the Governing Council reiterates its call for the implementation of firm measures to ensure open, competitive and well-functioning product and labour markets, so as to foster an attractive environment for investment and innovation and to promote flexibility in wages and prices. There is a broad and firm consensus that such reforms are beneficial in promoting growth and employment and in enhancing the resilience of the euro area economy to external shocks. At the same time, these reforms would further facilitate intra-euro area adjustments by reducing rigidities that contribute, in some economies, to wage developments that lead to high and persistent unit labour cost growth, higher inflationary pressure and losses in competitiveness. Examples of such rigidities are low productivity growth due to a lack of competition in some sectors and an explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices. All in all, a comprehensive set of reforms is essential to strengthen the foundations for sustained growth in output and employment across the euro area, to underpin the ongoing economic recovery and to further smoothen the functioning of adjustment mechanisms in the euro area, thereby facilitating the conduct of the single monetary policy. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  As regards today’s discussion, it was a very deep discussion, weighing the advantages and disadvantages associated with the various options that we had. There was an overwhelming sentiment that 25 basis points was appropriate, but we also weighed the advantages and disadvantages of having a 50 basis points increase. But again there was an overwhelming sentiment that 25 basis points was appropriate. On the elements that were in our analysis: as usual, and as I have repeated very often in such press conferences, we take absolutely all elements into consideration, including exchange rates, and our synthesis of those elements is based on a comprehensive overall analysis. Our decision certainly does not depend mechanistically on any particular input, including the input from the projections, which are an important piece of information for us. We look at our own staff projections, as well as the wealth of information which is coming from the public sector and the private sector, and, again, all of the various data and figures and models that we consider. We do not depend on any single piece of information or any single model of the economy. We want to be as comprehensive as possible. First, the question on volatility. We had a discussion on what we have been observing in financial markets over the last few weeks. And we observed that volatility had augmented in a large number of markets. We considered that it was certainly something which was important and to be taken into consideration in our overall assessment. That being said, we also looked at the fact that it came after a long period of very low volatility, something which could be regarded, according to some analysis, as a normal correctional phenomenon. Again, we will also continue to monitor closely developments in financial markets. In a way, the re-appreciation of risks in the financial markets also corresponds to a view of the Governing Council. That view which is shared at a global level by the constituency of central bankers - I say that as Chairman of the G10 -, which thinks that there has, to a certain extent, been an underpricing of risks in the global financial markets. Again, if this pricing of risks were to increase somewhat, it would perhaps be going in the direction of an improved pricing of risks. As regards the second question, I would only say that we are in exactly the same mood as before. If our assumptions and scenario – our baseline scenario – are progressively confirmed, and until now we have been very happy to see that it has been confirmed, then the progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation would be warranted. No, our slight change in methodology has not had a significant impact on the projections themselves. It is a technical change that we in the Governing Council judge appropriate, taking into account all the elements at stake. But as far as the assumptions about long-term rates are concerned, we - in taking a long-term rate assumption - took the yield curve foreseen by the market. Therefore, the change that we introduced is not as big as suspected by some, and consequently, I would not underline any significant change in the projections that could be attributed to that change. When I look at the projections, the changes in the growth projections for next year, which have been revised slightly downwards, are fully in line with other projections, for instance the Commission projection. And the main driving parameter has been the change in the assumption about oil prices. I have said often enough that I am Mr Euro. There is no doubt: we issue the currency and I sign the banknotes. My signature is on the notes. As far as the letter is concerned, I will only say the following. In my understanding, the relationship that the ECB has with the executive branches, in line with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, is probably the best organised at the global level. I invite, on behalf of the Governing Council, the President of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner to each meeting of the Governing Council, i.e. twice a month, which allows as much contact as possible. It allows not only informal contact with me but also the opportunity to see, from the inside, the deliberations of the Governing Council. Once a month I am invited, along with the Vice-President, to the Eurogroup meetings. This facilitates all kinds of contact and a deep understanding by Lucas and myself of the way the Eurogroup is reasoning, because we are present in the room. I do not think that you would find such an intimately organised relationship between a monetary authority and an executive branch anywhere else in the world. I think it is remarkable and I will take this opportunity to mention that it is something really exceptional in the world, but not unusual in Europe. For example, the Council of the Deutsche Bundesbank used to invite the members of the government to its meeting every fortnight, and, as a former Governor of the Banque de France – now it is Christian Noyer – I also invited the relevant member of the government – the Minister of Finance – to the meeting every fortnight. Of course, in the European tradition and in the Maastricht Treaty, this is accompanied by what I would call the inflexible independence of the monetary authority, which is in the Treaty and which forms the basis of our credibility. My third question is on exchange rates: you talked about not taking certain elements into account mechanistically, and I thought you were going to mention the exchange rate but you didn’t. Is that one element where it is generally presumed that when the euro strengthens, this, ipso facto, has some sort of dampening effect on whatever tightening you might be engaging in? And is it correct to say that you did not do that mechanistically? And I also have one last question for your Spanish host, Mr Caruana. I realise that you have probably answered this question, Mr Caruana, a million times already, but I am myself in Spain for the first time in ten years, and am seeing the extraordinary amount of building that has gone on, and is continuing to go on. Can you give us a sense of how you see this sector of the Spanish economy developing and whether you see the growth contours of the Spanish economy balancing out in the future, reflecting greater growth in the industrial or services sector rather than this heavy reliance on construction and real estate? In answer to your first question, if our scenario is confirmed, and until now it has been confirmed, the further withdrawal of monetary accommodation would be warranted, and this is clearly what I have been saying since December. We will see what happens. Of course, you can refer to this as a tightening of monetary policy, but I like to use the expression “withdrawing monetary accommodation” to refer to what we will do or could do according to the confirmation of our baseline scenario. It is absolutely clear that we have no pre-commitment and that this is the way the Governing Council has been looking at it since December, when I said for the first time that we were not committed ex ante to a particular sequencing of decisions. We are always conditional and we are always free to do what we judge to be appropriate. We do not make any unconditional commitments. We have never done so. Not even when we were at the very low historical level of 2% did we commit to maintaining that level for a considerable period of time. We always at any time do what we judge to be appropriate for countering the existing inflationary risks and ensuring price stability over the medium run and for continuing to anchor solidly inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability. In response to your third question, I would only say that I have already answered it. We look at absolutely all input, without any exception, and we have no mechanistic response to any particular individual input. We synthesise all the inputs, so to speak. Caruana: You know that over the past few years, we have had a very active and dynamic housing market in various respects: in terms of prices, in terms of activity, the number of new houses has been increasing dramatically, and also in terms of the credit granted to the households to buy these houses. Recently, we have started to see prices moderate. One year ago, the price increase was 17%, it then moved to 14%. Now it is around 12%.It is cooling off a little bit, but it is not yet clear that activity or credit has started to calm down. In terms of the evaluation, we have sometimes expressed that when you look at fundamentals, the present evaluation was above these fundamentals. We have signalled several times that this poses risks, but at the same time, we have also expressed that, in addition to the increasing debt, there has been an increase in the wealth of households, which is a positive development, and that the central scenario is still that this over-valuation could be corrected smoothly and not necessarily through an abrupt correction. We see risks that this could happen, but it is not our central scenario. We are very much following the development of this market. The preoccupation is not really the financial sector, but more the sensitivity of the consumer to developments in fundamentals, such as interest rates or the prices of homes, etc. Thank you very much. From our perspective, we look at the euro area as a whole. At the level of the euro area as a whole, credit to finance housing is very dynamic, despite the fact that it is much less dynamic in Germany. As I have always said, we think that our interest rates are correct and correspond to what is needed to counter inflationary risks. What we are see when we look at our baseline scenario is, that we have progressively gone to a level that is close to our potential. In a sense, this is going towards a more “normal” situation as regards growth and, it calls for countering increased inflationary risks and to progressively withdraw monetary accommodation. There has been no change whatsoever since December in the way we look at what is happening. We, the Governing Council, have no position on such matters and we have no power over them as a central bank. It is clear that, all other things being equal, my personal sentiment is that a European option would be better than an external option for whatever issues are at stake, whatever dossier is involved, and whatever question asked. I would also say that a euro area option is preferable to an extra-euro area option. And you can draw whatever conclusions you like from the various attempts, ideas and proposals that have been made thus far. All other things being equal, I would personally prefer a euro area option to another option, and a European option to another option. That having been said, it is not our responsibility to decide on the matter. We had no sentiment on that particular event. When we list the risks at a European and global level, I would say that we have the risk of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances, we have the risk of protectionism, we have the risks that are associated with a disorderly evolution of the global financial markets, given the underpricing of risks that I have already alluded to. We also have the oil price risks that we have now come to know rather well over a very long period of time, and I would say, in that respect, any event that occurs in the geopolitical sphere obviously has an influence. So, I would say that anything we have that goes in the direction of an alleviation of this combined risk of oil prices, commodity prices and geopolitical risk would go in a good direction, but I have no other comment. First of all, I have already responded to your last question and I said that we will do precisely what is necessary at any time, according to our own analysis, and that we will progressively withdraw monetary accommodation in line with the development of the baseline scenario. In our opinion, risks to price stability augmented sufficiently during the preceding period to trigger our interest rate increase in last December, a new interest rate increase in March, and the new interest rate increase today. It is obvious that we now see this baseline scenario developing in line with what we had already judged in December, and even before December. As far as the monetary analysis is concerned, we utilise it to cross-check the economic analysis and the result of both analysis explains why we increased rates in December and March and why we have done so again today. As regards the sentiment of today, there was an overwhelming majority that thought that 25 basis points was more appropriate. This was the judgement of the Governing Council as regards the level of risks that we have to counter at the moment and it was in line with what – to my understanding- the market itself was appreciating. We are totally candid and totally open: everybody knows what our definition of price stability is, everybody knows the figures, everybody knows our two-pillar strategy, and everybody can make his own judgement taking that into account. As you know, not all central banks are as candid and transparent regarding their definition of price stability and their monetary policy concept. So the decision we took was fully in line with our monetary policy strategy. On the first question I will stick to the statement made in the Communiqué of the G7 and on the paragraph that deals with exchange rates. I have no other message. And when I have a message you know pretty well by past observations that I give it! On the future trajectory of our interest rates, we are working on the assumption that we will proceed with a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation; not unconditionally, but conditional on the confirmation of facts and data, and on the basis of our own future observations. We have no ex ante commitment. This is the working assumption. We will do what is necessary, when necessary, and we are not stuck to any pre-commitment of any sort. We can proceed more rapidly or less rapidly. We are free and we remain free to do at any time whatever is needed. The fact that we have increased rates three times at intervals of three months is not due to some ex ante idea that we would increase rates by a certain amount at regular intervals. We judged these increases to be the best and most appropriate way of dealing with the risk that we had analysed. Caruana: Regarding your first question about credit, what a central bank does and what we have been trying to do is to signal very clearly the need for banks to measure properly the risks involved in lending. We do not tell banks what is to be done, what is to be increased or what lending figures they should have. What we are signalling is that they should take into account all factors, and not just today’s factors. They should also work with scenarios that provide information on the capacity of borrowers and on their own capacity if a scenario were to change even if the central scenario is not going to change. It is a necessary analysis. So what we have been asking for is prudence, measuring properly the risks, taking into account properly the risks and in that sense I think we have achieved a lot. I think the dynamism of the credit reflects to some extent the dynamism of the economy and I think it would be appropriate to have a little bit of a slowing but again, it is a question of each bank deciding and taking the measures necessary to ensure that they can handle the risk that they are taking. I turn to the question on the differential between inflation rates inside the euro area. I had a number of occasions, including contacts with the executive branches both individually and collectively in the Eurogroup, to say that we, the ECB’s Governing Council, are responsible for average inflation and the inflationary expectations in the euro area as a whole: the average inflation for the 313 million inhabitants that are our fellow citizens in the euro area. In a way we are responsible for the level of the sea, but some swimmers, if I may, can swim above that level other ones below. The inflationary expectations have to be anchored for the euro area as a whole. The difference between the average euro area inflation level and the national inflation level is the responsibility of the national authorities. Again, at the level of the Eurosystem we can only ensure price stability and the credibility of price stability over time for the euro area as a whole, and that is very important. And of course we call on the national authorities to be fully conscious of their responsibility vis-à-vis their inflation differential with the average. That being said I would also draw your attention to an argument which I see from time to time and which does not seem to me to be appropriate. Some argue that the real interest rates in some euro area economies are precisely influenced by this inflation differential and that some economies are benefiting from low real rates while others are suffering from high real rates. I would draw your attention to the following: the level of inflation, which is closely correlated with the unit labour cost and the costs in general in the economy, functions in such a way that what one particular firm would theoretically gain out of a theoretical abstract computation of real interest rates is much more than offset by a loss in terms of cost competitiveness: what is lost when inflation is above the average is much greater than what you could theoretically gain with a lower level of real rates. This is very important. On protectionism you cannot expect anything from the Governing Council of the ECB but the demand for completion of the single market. Full completion of the single market is a target which seems to us extraordinarily important, not only because it is one of the major goals of Europe as a whole, but because it would considerably improve the functioning of the European economy. It would elevate the level of growth potential; it would raise the “speed limit” of growth in Europe, and in the euro area. It will also facilitate the functioning of monetary policy, because the more an economy is flexible, the more an economy is competitive, the more you can obtain price stability with ease. I will not comment more on stock exchanges. I have said all that I had to say and, again, we have no power in this domain ourselves. Also on the issue of protectionism in commercial banking, which is particularly topical in cross-border mergers or cross-border cooperation, I would say that the most recent evolution that we have observed has been moving in a much more favourable direction than previous observations. On the issue of sound fiscal policies it’s an allusion to the fact that in good times a great number of countries and economies have unfortunately not paved the way for coping with more difficult periods of time and this issue is very closely associated with the preventive aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact. We believe that repeating the mistakes of the past would be terrible because as we know, those mistakes had an enormous cost and were extraordinarily difficult to cope with. As regards our deliberations, we did exactly as we always do. There was absolutely no change. A presentation was made by José Manuel González-Páramo on the one hand, as Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell used to do, on the financial markets. We had a presentation by Jürgen Stark on the economic and monetary side of the coin. And in line with the majority view of the Executive Board, there was a proposal made by Jürgen Stark, as always. So there was absolutely no change as regards the functioning of the Governing Council. As you know, all our decisions are collegial decisions. There are no individual decisions in our decision-making process and our credibility is the credibility of an institution – and it cannot be anything but the credibility of an institution, because we must be credible on a 10, 20, 30 and 50-year basis. There are bond issues on a 50-year basis! The institution is there, and the women and men in the institution are replaced. Nobody stays here forever. We were on this occasion paying homage to Otmar, and it was also a good occasion to welcome Jürgen. As regards the letter, it was a personal, individual letter, which Jean-Claude Juncker did not, to my knowledge, discuss with the members of the Eurogroup. I did not discuss that with the Governing Council. I told you what my own views are. It was an exchange of personal views. As regards monetary inflation, we will – and it was said by Otmar – publish the results of this exercise. I draw your attention to the fact that it is a work in progress and not underwritten by the Executive Board. It is very interesting and stimulating work, which is being done at staff level, and we consider that this is good to work on, but we clearly have more work to do in this particular domain. As regards hedge funds, the Vice-President, as you know, presented the sentiments of the ECB, of the Governing Council, in the last issue of our own Financial Stability Review, which was very comprehensive, and for the first time included a box on hedge funds, a section on hedge funds, which was considered by the global media to be an important one. Perhaps you could say a word on that, Lucas. Vice-President: In the Financial Stability Review, we focused on risks associated with the operations of hedge funds. Hedge funds are, by definition, institutions that are in the business of taking and diversifying risk. And they have played an important role in the diversification of risks and in contributing to the efficiency of the financial system. One important issue is how the counterparties of the hedge funds, i.e. banks and businesses, can assess risks that are associated with the products that are being offered, as well as with the hedge funds as institutions. And to this end, we emphasised various issues. Of course, one important issue is that the risk management systems are further improved, and they have improved a lot in recent years. But we also emphasised the importance of enhanced information and disclosure. So, in this context, the proposal, because you asked specifically about the proposal made by the Bundesbank, is a proposal which merits consideration and further study. Caruana: I have not much to say about this, really. I would just like to say that I have spent my years here working on monetary policy, central banking and financial stability issues, and I now look forward to working in these areas from a different perspective in the IMF, which is a great institution, in a few months’ time. But today, and for a bit more than one month, I will continue to be here and will continue to do my work as Governor and as a member of the Governing Council of the ECB. Can I seize this opportunity to say that Jaime has had the confidence of the whole of the international community in chairing the Basel Committee, which is one of the most important positions you can have in the constituency of surveillance authorities and central banks. As Chairman of the G10, I conveyed to Jaime the incredible debt of gratitude that we have to him. I said that we were expecting him to continue to play a major role in the international financial community. Jaime, we are extraordinarily happy that you will indeed continue very soon to play that role. I will respond to the second question first. As I said, we all considered that a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation was clearly appropriate. For 2007 our main understanding of why the growth rate is projected to be slightly lower is associated with the oil price impact. It does not hamper the trend that we have over the medium run of growth around potential. As regards the Chief Economist, it is not a position that we ever decided upon. Such qualification was given by the external world to Otmar as a very appropriate denomination, but we did not take such a decision. I very much insist that we are a college and all decisions are collegial. There is no dominant influence. If there were to be, it would be the influence of the President. But there is no dominant influence precisely because we rely upon collegial wisdom and that is absolutely essential in monetary policy. All central banks that are independent rely entirely on collegial wisdom and that is absolutely crucial. Furthermore, I am particularly attached to team spirit within the Executive Board, which is a collegial body. The Vice-President and I have a special responsibility for that team spirit to be as good and deep as possible. I was able to mention the team spirit of the Eurosystem and of the Governing Council yesterday in front of all our colleagues. We are a team: the 13 – and very soon 14 – institutions that make up the Eurosystem are a team. I must confess that I am impressed and very heartened by the team spirit that we have been demonstrating very well for a number of years now. Thank you, Jaime, for the organisation of today’s Governing Council meeting and all the best in your future position. "
04/05/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Overall, the information which has become available since our last meeting broadly confirms our earlier assessment of the outlook for price developments and economic activity in the euro area, and that monetary and credit growth remains very dynamic. Against this background, the Governing Council will exercise strong vigilance in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Such vigilance is particularly warranted in a context of ample liquidity and still very low levels of nominal and real interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum, implying an overall accommodative monetary policy stance. For monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and employment in the euro area, inflation expectations must be firmly anchored. Let me now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. The data that have become available since the start of the year point to a re-acceleration of economic growth in the first quarter of 2006, following the moderation observed in the last quarter of 2005. In addition, the latest indicators and survey information point to continued growth in the second quarter and lend support to the scenario of a gradual broadening in economic activity as embodied in the March 2006 ECB staff projections. Business confidence is particularly buoyant, which, in principle, bodes well for investment, and the recovery in consumption and employment appears to be proceeding, albeit still gradually. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for continued growth over the coming quarters. Activity in the world economy is expected to remain strong, providing continued support for euro area exports. Investment growth should benefit from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, and gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should also strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation continues to improve. This favourable outlook for economic growth is broadly in line with available forecasts from international organisations and the private sector. Considering the information available, risks to this scenario appear broadly balanced over the shorter term, although recently oil prices have again demonstrated high volatility and their potential for posing downside risks to growth. This underlines the need for further improvement in the transparency of oil markets and further investment in this sector. Concerns about global imbalances continue to prevail over longer horizons, as do risks relating to protectionism With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in April 2006, compared with 2.2% in March and 2.3% in February. In the short term, annual inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, with the month-to-month profile largely dependent on developments in oil prices and the strength of their pass-through to other prices along the production chain. Beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to affect inflation significantly in 2007 and a further upward impact may also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. At the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate in recent quarters and wage growth is expected to remain contained, partly reflecting global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Recent wage moderation has helped to dampen domestic inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, it is equally crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, not least with a view to fostering employment growth. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger wage developments than expected at present, possibly due to second-round effects stemming from past oil price increases. Turning to the monetary analysis, in a context of ample liquidity in the euro area, monetary and credit growth remains very dynamic. In particular, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has continued to increase over recent months and has now reached double-digit levels. Credit growth has also become more broadly based across sectors, with borrowing both by households – especially for house purchase – and by non-financial corporations growing more strongly. Monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components. Thus the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion. Overall, further acceleration of monetary and credit growth in this environment continues to point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments, therefore, require careful monitoring, especially in the light of the strengthening of economic activity and, in particular, of strong asset price dynamics, especially in housing markets. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007 and the economic analysis confirms that the risks to price stability continue to lie on the upside. Some of these risks appear to have increased in view of the renewed strength of oil prices. Given strong money and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. It therefore remains crucial to ensure that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability – a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. Accordingly, particular vigilance is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. With respect to fiscal policies, there are some signs that the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and commitment to the rules have improved since last year’s revision. However, fiscal targets in a number of cases are rather lenient and their attainment is still subject to considerable risks. The Governing Council therefore supports any further reinforcement of fiscal consolidation efforts that also takes full advantage of a more favourable economic environment. Appropriately ambitious fiscal targets as part of a comprehensive structural reform programme would bring deficit and debt ratios down more rapidly. This is decisive in order to secure the sustainability of public finances. Such strategies would also boost confidence in the economic prospects of the euro area. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council again stresses the importance of undertaking comprehensive reforms to ensure open, competitive and well-functioning labour and product markets, including the promotion of wage and price flexibility and the fostering of an attractive environment for investment and innovation. The need for such reforms has again been highlighted by recent oil price developments, as they would enhance the resilience of the euro area economy to external shocks. There is a broad and firm consensus that openness and flexibility are beneficial in promoting growth and employment and it is now essential to turn the agreed reform plans into actions and to strengthen them where necessary. By pushing forward with ambitious structural reforms, euro area countries will also lend support to the ongoing economic recovery. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  I can only tell you that we took the decision of today on the basis of the analysis that I have exposed in detail, both the economic analysis and the monetary analysis, and our conclusion is again that we would be in a posture of strong vigilance, particular vigilance. I used the word several times, perhaps three times if you counted well. And this is our today’s sentiment. We have no predetermined decision. Everything that we do is conditional upon our own analysis based upon as robust as possible information, analysis, data, facts and figures, as I always say. I would say there is a lot of new information which came in until now, that confirms our main scenario. I could go back to our analysis in December and at the beginning of this year, because you might remember that we had not that good data in some respects. But we said that we were extracting all the information, and that the underlying growth trend in our own analysis was around potential, and we have been proved right, until now. So, if the main scenario is confirmed, further withdrawal of the present monetary accommodation will be warranted. But we do not commit or pre-commit to anything. It seems to me that you always got me right in the press conference. As you know, we have every month a rendez-vous here and it is that rendez-vous which allows us to present to you the conclusions and sentiment of the Governing Council. If you look at what happened between all the monthly rendez-vous we have had, you will see that I always stick to what I have said on behalf of the Governing Council. As regards the inflation risk we consider that this risk is going upwards and that is why we said vigilance is of the essence. For example on a short-term basis, obviously, the price of oil has gone up and that is something important. As regards the economic analysis, we have confirmation that our working assumption, our main scenario, is pertinent and with growth growing faster than before, it pushes up risks to price stability. And in the longer term, or medium to longer term, we have the monetary analysis which is pointing in the same direction. First of all, I would like to be absolutely clear: I will stick to the document I signed in Washington, the G7 communiqué – you are aware of. You also know that the paragraph it contains on exchange rates is not, in any respect, sending a message that would call for a change in our relationship with the US dollar. There has certainly not been any such message. Second, I have always mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council that the risk of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances is a risk to growth that we have to be aware of. Our conclusion in Washington was very clear, namely that homework has to be done by all partners. And we were more explicit, as you know, than in the earlier G7 reflections with the publication of a full page listing the homework that has to be done by the United States, Japan, emerging Asia, the oil-producing countries and Europe. I have mentioned Europe’s homework in the last paragraph of today’s Introductory Statement – the structural reforms that we have to carry out. These will be our contribution, perhaps a modest one, because we are not largely imbalanced, as you know. But by increasing the growth potential of Europe, we would certainly contribute more actively to global growth and this would facilitate the orderly unwinding of these imbalances. And by raising labour productivity, particularly in the services sector and in the non-tradable sector we would also contribute to that unwinding. I mentioned this in particular at all the meetings we had in Washington, at the IMFC or at the G7. You know that there are a number of contributions to growth. We have in particular the consumption of households, we have investment, and we have the external side. And, in the case of the national economy, i.e. the largest economy in the euro area that you have mentioned, it is clear that the main drivers of growth are – at the moment, but that might change and I trust that it will change – exports, net exports, and investment. This is important, because it started in the middle of last year and was, of course, one of the signals that were very encouraging. As you also know, the normal sequence in any economy, in theory, and certainly historically in Germany, would be first exports, then investment and finally domestic consumption. It is clear that we still have mixed signals in domestic consumption, as you underlined with this morning’s figure. Again, what we have to extract from all this information –is the trend. We trust that there are very good reasons for the German economy, on the one hand, and the euro area as a whole, on the other, to gradually and progressively register a more dynamic growth of domestic consumption and household consumption. We will see how it develops. One good reason is certainly the improvement in the employment figures. Here we have had the clearly good news of the decrease in unemployment down to 8.1% at the level of the euro area. This is one of the elements that could argue in favour of a change in the overall behaviour of some of the consumers. That having been said, it must never be forgotten that we look at the euro area as a whole, not only at the largest economy, and that there are some economies in the euro area in which consumption is quite dynamic, even very dynamic. We have to take all of them into account. Question (translation): When Mr Duisenberg was in office, foreign-exchange reserves accounted for 14% of the various national central banks’ reserves. This percentage is now higher and a growing number of national central banks are topping up their euro reserves with foreign-exchange reserves. How high the percentage is now and what do you expect it to be in the coming years? Of course, you will receive dollars in return for euro. Do you want to maintain the same percentage of dollars, and then write them off later, or are you thinking of increasing the share of securities or gold in the reserves? You know that since the very setting-up of the ECB, it has been the policy of the Governing Council, expressed by my predecessor Wim and now by myself, not to encourage the international use of the euro. We are also not discouraging the international use of the euro. We consider that the decisions are up to the various parties concerned. I would say that as orderly and smooth evolutions as possible are certainly welcome in this respect. It is what we have observed since the setting-up of the euro, and all the information that I have from various sources, including the IMF, the BIS and other institutions, confirms that this evolution remains very smooth and very orderly. I have no other comments on that. Answering to your first question, I stick to what I have already said. Vigilance is of the essence. I have already used that word several times, and I have already said that, contrary to what some would think, there is no rule to exclude a decision when we are not in Frankfurt. As to your second question, as you know we include absolutely all elements in our analysis. We synthesise our understanding of what is happening, we examine various models of the economy and of the behaviour of the euro area economy to have as robust analysis as possible, and then we make up our mind on the basis of all this information. We do not have a mechanistic approach. Our decision is not triggered by any particular data, and what counts, is the overall judgement on the basis of all information.  On your first point I have not studied the accord that you mention. I will refer to the fact that when we meet every year with our friends the governors of the central banks of the Asian continent, we always express our willingness to tell them what the European experience has been – particularly as regards monetary cooperation, ERM cooperation and the single currency endeavour. – They always show a lot of interest in what we can offer in this respect. Some ideas are being floated in Asia – some are very bold, others are more modest, and some are concentrating at this stage on deepening and reinforcing the financial markets in a pan-continental, pan-Asian model. But I will not comment on any bold moves that may have been decided. I have no information on that at this stage. As regards our technical cooperation with the Gulf, I can confirm to you that we are involved in a technical cooperation. The ECB and the Eurosystem have been asked by the Gulf Cooperation Council to pass on our own experience and understanding of what the appropriate requirements are for a single currency to be a success technically and economically. Obviously we have expressed our availability vis-à-vis all our friends, all over the world, who would like to have our views on our own experiences. I could also confirm to you that the Eurosystem has regular meetings with our Latin American friends –. We also have meetings with Mediterranean central banks – those to the south of the Mediterranean. We are very open to this kind of dialogue and exchange of experiences At today’s meeting we were unanimous in our attitude, decision and overall analysis, which I have explained to you at length. As regards what I have said, what others have said and what the Vice-President has said, we all agree that we see till now the confirmation of the main scenario that I have already mentioned. We will have next month the Eurosystem staff projections and the data and we will see whether this confirms this main scenario. Until now we have been very lucid and I want to go back to December and to March. Some people – including some in this very room – were telling us “Look, some of these figures are not that flattering!” You will remember that we had a poor last quarter of last year, and it was known during the first quarter of this year. And we said that if we extracted all information from what we had, the pertinent information remained that growth trend was around potential. Until now, all of this has been confirmed. Again, I remain prudent and cautious. We will not pre-commit in any respect, but I have to say that we are satisfied that we were right. We did not wait for other information; we thought that it was appropriate to increase rates in December and to increase rates in March. As I have said already to the extent that our scenario is confirmed, it is clear that further withdrawals of monetary accommodation will be warranted, and there is no doubt about that. What I said in December, in January and after was that we had not decided, ex ante, on the sort of series of interest rate increases which had been observed in other countries. But again, if our scenario is confirmed, it is clear that further withdrawals of monetary accommodation will be of the essence. As regards our next meeting we will take a decision when the time comes and you will see what the decision is at our June meeting. No, I think that this risk has not augmented. I would even be bold enough to say that, when I participated in the various “Gs”, including the G7 in Washington, I had the sentiment that all parties concerned were speaking for real when they said that they would do their best to implement what I call their “homework”, all partners including us, even if our contribution might not be very large. We are all in the same boat. We are a single global economy and we all have homework to do. What I also noted is that all partners are convinced, and that is true for John Snow and Ben Bernanke, as well as for ministers and central bank governors concerned including me, we are all convinced that this homework is not a burden that we have to accept for the sake of the greater interest of the global economy, which is true of course, but first and foremost it is something which is good for each economy. This is particularly true in our case, we would be much better off if we had more growth and more job creation through structural reforms. But it is also true for the United States and for emerging Asia. Don’t expect any comment from me. The markets make their own judgement, and that is up to them. We take our decision, and what is important is that we take good decisions. I did not say that. But I said that it was my firm understanding and conviction that each party concerned was convinced that their respective homework had to be done. As regards the administered price increases, I think that those that have already been decided for next year are well-known. A risk would be that further increases could be made. That is a risk that we always mention. As regards the most important risk, it’s the constant position of the Governing Council that the most important risk would be second-round effects. Let me remind you, that at some time in the past I heard analysts and perhaps even some media suggesting that we should wait for the second-round effects to materialise before increasing rates. It would have been the biggest mistake we could have made. We of course have to prevent this risk from materialising. We have to be ahead of the curve. That’s the reason why we increased rates in December and in March and why vigilance if of the essence today. We do not have second-round effects materialising and this is good. More, than that it is necessary. It is one of the conditions for sustainable growth. We strongly encourage social partners to continue to be highly responsible in this respect. And we have to remain vigilant. All partners have to remain vigilant in this respect. This was also my response to your third question: I do not see these second-round risks materialising at the present moment, including in wage and salary formation, but we have to remain vigilant. I would be cautious - as you might understand - on the projections. They are worked out by the staff. It is a very professional exercise and I do not want to prejudge in any respect what could be produced. All what I can say at the moment I am speaking - again I remain very cautious - by making the synthesis of all the information we have been receiving – information on growth, information on oil price increases, information on exchange rates, all kinds of information –is that it broadly confirms our baseline scenario, but I will not confirm anything that would suggest that our growth projection would be different from the present baseline scenario to the extent that you addressed explicitly the question of growth. We will see and we will look at the result of this professional exercise. Again our working assumption is that broadly our present assessment will be confirmed. As regards the IMF, the meetings in Washington were good meetings in respects, in particular because partners were more and more convinced that they had a lot of homework to do. I had the possibility of expressing the view of the ECB in the IMFC meeting, so I respond to your question, it has been the case as we had called for. It was also the clear will of Gordon Brown, the President of the IMFC, to reinforce the capacity of the IMFC to embark on a real global surveillance exercise. The IMF has, as you know, also reflected a lot on its own reform and progressive and orderly transformation, and it is followed very carefully by the European side. As you know, we look at inflationary expectations from a variety of angles. One angle is the financial markets and there are various angles because you can compute the forward, break-even, medium and long-term rates, and you can compute the break-even rate without going forward and so forth. We also have the surveys, which are steady in confirming the 1.9% inflationary expectations on a medium-term basis. This is certainly something which is good from the standpoint of the anchoring of inflationary expectations in a period where we have oil shocks that are succeeding oil shocks. We look very carefully at the information which we can extract from financial markets, and we have noted a tendency for break even inflation it to go up again. So it has to be looked at very carefully. This is one of the reasons why we mention vigilance three times. I have already said what I have to say on exchange rates. I stick to the G 7 communiqué I commented on it already. We integrate into our overall judgement all pertinent information, including information on exchange rates. But no particular data trigger a mechanistic response from us. I already responded on the way we look at this if our main scenario develops, as we believe it will. It seems to me that the other major institutions also believe it will. At the global level, it is not particularly the sentiment of the Governing Council of the ECB, it is perhaps rather the sentiment at the level of the G10 and of the global economy meeting that we regularly have in Basel - which I have the privilege of chairing - that progressively the very powerful dampening that you mentioned on global inflation stemming from globalisation itself, and the increase of the share in the global economy coming from very low unit labour cost economy, that this is perhaps gradually diminishing. This is one of the overall remarks that can be made and I already made that remark when I mentioned the sentiment of this particular central banks constituency. Thank you very much indeed for your attention. "
06/04/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged, following the increase of 25 basis points on 2 March 2006. The information which has become available since then confirms our assessment that a further adjustment of our accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted to address upside risks to price stability. It remains essential to ensure that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. With interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum still at very low levels in both nominal and real terms, and monetary and credit growth remaining strong and liquidity ample, our monetary policy remains accommodative. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Turning first to the economic analysis, recent information has confirmed our assessment of an improved outlook for economic growth in the euro area, following the more subdued developments in late 2005. On the basis of the latest data, survey releases and various indicator-based estimates, it appears that growth is strengthening and broadening in the first half of 2006. Indeed, the conditions remain in place for solid growth over the coming quarters. Activity in the world economy remains strong, providing support for euro area exports. Investment activity is expected to remain solid, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should also strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation continues to gradually improve. This outlook for economic activity is also confirmed by available forecasts from international organisations and private sector institutions. The risks to economic growth appear to be broadly balanced over the shorter term. Further ahead, downside risks still relate to potential increases in oil prices and concerns about global imbalances. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in March 2006, compared with 2.3% in February and 2.4% in January. In the short run, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, with the precise levels depending largely on developments in the more volatile components of the index. Beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to significantly affect inflation in 2006 and 2007, and an upward impact may also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. At the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate over recent quarters and growth in wages is expected to remain contained, partly reflecting strong global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Over the recent past, moderate wage trends have helped to dampen domestic inflationary pressures; looking ahead, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a possibly stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger wage and price developments than expected due to second-round effects of past oil price increases. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the high trend rate of monetary expansion. Moreover, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector has continued to increase over recent months, with borrowing by households – especially loans for house purchase – and non-financial corporations rising rapidly. Overall, strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity in the euro area continues to point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, and the economic analysis indicates that the risks to price stability remain on the upside. Given the strength of monetary growth and the ample liquidity situation in a context of improving economic activity, cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability over the medium to long term prevail. It is essential that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. As regards fiscal policies, while the budgetary results reported for 2005 are mostly better than anticipated a few months ago, the budget balances planned for 2006 imply no significant progress in fiscal consolidation for the euro area as a whole. Given the economic outlook, a faster pace of deficit reduction is necessary. Delaying fiscal consolidation in times of improving economic activity implies risks for the medium term, as has been observed in the past. Speeding up deficit reduction on the basis of credible and fully specified measures as part of a comprehensive reform programme would help to enhance confidence in the medium-term prospects of the euro area and prevent a repeat of past experiences, when complacency in good times contributed to persistent budgetary disequilibria. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomes the call by the European Council, which met in Brussels on 23-24 March 2006, to maintain the momentum of the re-launched Lisbon strategy for growth and employment. As emphasised by the European Council, the focus should now be on ensuring the effective, timely and comprehensive implementation of the measures agreed in the national reform programmes presented by Member States and, if necessary, on strengthening them. These measures are designed to, among other things, enhance the sustainability and quality of public finances, promote flexible labour and product markets, support a favourable business environment, and ensure a fully operational EU internal market, including the markets for energy and services. Applying comprehensive structural reforms is of particular importance for the euro area countries, in order to increase wage and price flexibility and the resilience to shocks, facilitate structural adjustment, raise potential output growth and job creation, and reduce price pressures, thereby facilitating the task of the single monetary policy. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  First of all, as regards the first question, I would say, with some caution, that we do not observe any secondary effects today. They would represent a high risk, but one which did not materialise. I mentioned, in particular, what we observed in the sphere of wages and salaries. I draw your attention to the fact that if and when you do observe those secondary effects, it is already too late. So, our problem is to prevent them from materialising. We are not particularly happy because they are not materialising, we consider that it is exactly what should be observed. We are doing our own job properly, when we do not see these secondary effects materialising. As regards the monetary pillar, you know it is one of the major differences between our monetary concept and a number of others that we are continuing what was the strong tradition and also the success of the euro area national central banks before the euro was set up. I have mentioned the fact that the Governing Council follows what is happening very carefully. The development of the monetary aggregates and their counterparts is very dynamic, particularly loans to the private sector. This is something that we interpret in the medium to longer run, as more and more economists and the mainstream are also doing, as an important information regarding future inflation. As we do in all our meetings which concentrate on monetary policy, we discussed the issue of rates. We discussed it at length. It is our responsibility to be as clear and transparent as possible with market participants, investors and savers. I would say that the current suggestions regarding the high probability of an increase of rates in our next meeting do not correspond to the present sentiment of the Governing Council. I would also add that the sentiment that I see from time to time in some remarks or market literature concerning the perception that we do not increase rates when we are out of Frankfurt is equally not at all the sentiment of the Governing Council. I trust that, for the sake of clarity, transparency and simplicity, it was perhaps useful to make these two remarks. And it is true, vigilance is not mentioned in the introductory remarks, as you very wisely remarked. As you know, we do not qualify all the decisions that are taken in member countries of the euro area. We usually provide general orientation, convey general messages, and make general recommendations for the euro area as a whole. In the present particular case, even if the Governing Council did not discuss that, I would say that it does not seem to me in line with what would be appropriate. Again. Clarity and transparency are essential. First, as regards growth, the sentiment of the Government Council as expressed in the introductory remarks is that we had confirmation during the last month of the way we had assessed the situation in our last meeting. You may remember we were a little bit challenged after our last monetary policy meeting. We increased rates, while we said: yes, there is some volatility as regards quarterly growth. It’s true that quarterly growth appeared to be a little less flattering than was expected for the fourth quarter but we look at the trend. We consider the trend as the pertinent entity. We make a synthesis out of all information received and we are not impressed by short-term or quarterly volatility. It seems clear to me that it was a good way to look at the situation and that all the information we have had since then has confirmed that we have a trend which is around our growth potential. So I see absolutely nothing which would contradict the way we were looking at the situation a month ago. You were mentioning downside risks to growth in a number of countries. I would say that the Governing Council considers that the risks as regards growth are really balanced at the moment I am speaking. I could even say there are a number of indications which are really on the upside. But we remain prudent. We look at the trend, we are not impressed by the volatility of figures, whether they are so-called soft data or hard data. It has always been the position of the Governing Council and of the ECB. It’s part of our way of looking at things. As regards your second question: first of all, we never comment on rumours. You could have asked a question on rumours about markets, exchange rates, etc. – we never comment on rumours. Second, our communication is transparent, crystal clear and public. There is absolutely no concept of “anonymous communication” by the Governing Council. We don’t like and we don’t need anonymous communication. Why would we need anonymous communication? And on the occasion of the successive press conferences I communicate on behalf of the Governing Council. There is a lot of public and transparent communication. I have said all that I have to say on both May and June. You may draw your own conclusions, but it seems to me that I was very clear on both May and June. First, we consider in the Governing Council that we owe you – as journalists, observers, watchers and market participants – the appropriate level of clarity and transparency. We are very proud to be transparent, and we are also very proud to have introduced the concept of transparency and real time communication from the very beginning of the setting up of the euro, under the presidency of my predecessor. This is one of our assets, and we are very attached to that. Second, let us not complicate things. From time to time, we give markets pieces of information that the markets regard as important information. I remember when I said, on behalf of the Governing Council, that we would probably do something in December. This was not known by the market at all, so the market took that as an important piece of information. From time to time, we give information that is a little bit different from what the market may have expected. In the present case, it is perhaps a slight correction, because the market, if I am not misled, is pricing in a 100% probability that in June at the latest we will move rates. What I told you concerns May, and I do not want to elaborate more on that. Each time we will consider what is necessary for you to have as pertinent communication and what I, as spokesperson of the Governing Council, should communicate to you. It is as simple as that, and that is what we are doing today. Thank you very much indeed for your question. As regards the first point, I would say that it is probably normal behaviour to consider the last indication that you have received as a very important indication. I have seen that both in the market and in the media. So when we have “bad news”, the idea that we will slow down the process of normalisation, in which we are, is always observed. The reasoning might go “Bad fourth quarter last year, ahah, they will probably cool down their interest rate increases; good news, of course they will accelerate.” As I told you, we do not reason like that. We take a medium-term perspective; we extract all the information we can in order to identify the trend. We are not too impressed by volatility. I guess that the reaction of some people might have been the result of being impressed by some very good figures that we had for Germany. These figures are a reason to rejoice, I have to say. For instance, the various Ifo surveys, the PMI and so forth, were giving a very good sign, and there have been a number of such signs. We extract information and transform it into a trend. In the process of normalisation, in which we are, we draw the appropriate conclusions in our fashion, namely with serenity and steadiness. As regards the fiscal situation, our judgement is that, in the present episode of the cycle, and at the level of the various economies of the euro area as a whole, we have good behaviour and less good behaviour. But taking the euro area as a whole, we really believe that what is in the financing laws for 2006, does not correspond to the optimum in a period of cyclical recovery, even if we had some good news as regards the 2005 final results. They are in fact only quasi-final results because, in this domain, we always have to wait for the definitive figures. For a number of reasons and, in particular, for structural reasons, good and sound fiscal policies are absolutely of the essence in Europe and are closely associated with structural reforms. First of all, I said all I had to say on June and can confirm to you that we have absolutely no rules regarding not increasing rates when we are meeting outside Frankfurt. As regards the pace I was very clear: we are abstracting trends, looking at the facts and figures, being pragmatic. It’s clear that in June we will have a wealth of new information coming from a variety of angles, including the last quarterly results and the staff projections, amongst others. As regards France, we did not discuss, and the Governing Council does not have a position on the French reform. I can only say that, in the Governing Council’s opinion, the rigidities of markets are playing a very important negative role in producing mass unemployment, not only in France but in the whole of the euro area, which is unfortunately characterised by too high a level of unemployment. The rigidities in the labour market are particularly important in France. So if the goal is to progressively reduce unemployment, and ultimately eliminate mass unemployment, everything that is done with the aim of achieving less rigidity goes in the right direction. Inside the euro area, or the de facto euro area, you have very good examples that could be benchmarked: you have Ireland, which has no mass unemployment. It is a success because of the absence of rigidities in the economy, including the labour market. You have Denmark, which has a very different concept: it is de facto in the euro area, since it follows our monetary policy and has no mass unemployment. Denmark also has a very good level of flexibility and absence of rigidity in the labour market, together with a good social protection. We see that it works, we have examples and we are not necessary obliged to look at examples outside the euro area, as we have them “ à la maison”, at home. Thank you very much again for your question. On the first question, I have already said that we never comment on rumours. We give messages, we don’t comment on rumours. If you start commenting on rumours, you get into a dialogue which begins to be very abnormal. And again, anonymous declarations are, in our eyes absolutely nothing. As regards the discussion on accommodation or neutral rates and so forth, I would only say that what we have always been doing is to counter inflation risks. We do all that is necessary, even if it implies, at some moment, going over the neutral rate. The neutral rate itself is a very complex, Wicksellian concept. It is one of these concepts on which, of course, you could see a lot of different analysis and a lot of different opinions. I would only say that we are in a process of normalisation, we are in the process of countering inflation risks that we have seen as being on the upside for some time. That is why we have increased rates twice and why there will be an increase in rates in the future. We will do what we think is appropriate, taking into account our own analysis and all the information we extract from both analyses – both monetary and economic analysis. We are extracting the trends and we have a medium-term, a longer-term perspective; that is the concept. We do not hesitate. You could go back to only one month ago when some of your colleagues would have questioned increasing rates at the moment where you see that euro area growth in the last quarter of 2005 was only 0.3 %, which is much lower than the growth potential or trend rates. Again we do not hesitate, we do what we judge is appropriate in such circumstances; we do that with a view to extracting all the pertinent information. I told you that information received in the last thirty days confirm our previous analysis. I wouldn’t say that the Governing Council underwrites the staff projections, but we had the staff projections and we have the overall projections of international institutions. We are convinced that we are growing at a pace which corresponds, presently, to the best of our information, to the euro area’s growth potential. I take your point. First: I don’t want to prejudge the outcome of the next international meetings, be they G7 meetings or IMF meetings. But it’s absolutely clear, if I refer to the present global diagnosis, on which we agree, that homework has to be done on both sides of the Atlantic and of the Pacific. On our side of the Atlantic, it’s clear that structural reforms are absolutely of the essence and could contribute not only to being better off in Europe but also to a better situation at a global level. We would contribute more to global growth and more to the solution of the global imbalances. On the other side of the Atlantic, it’s clear that the problem is not one of economic rigidities. It is clearly a lack of savings, a lack of domestic savings. This problem is of a very substantial size and you are right to say that we don’t see presently a correction of that situation. We all agree, on both sides of the Atlantic, that this lack of domestic savings is mirrored by a current account deficit of considerable magnitude which has to be corrected. As you know, we also judge that Japan has to continue with its structural reforms, just as the Europeans have to do. That being said, when we take a decision, we take all elements into consideration. But I would not attach a particular importance to imbalances in our decision. We see these imbalances as a risk to growth and, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, we see two major risks to growth: the price of oil and global imbalances. I will not comment on the saying itself! No, we do what we judge and trust is appropriate to do and it would be a mistake to do anything for reasons falling outside our own mandate. From time to time, we receive very good advice: “Don’t increase rates, please.” You might remember a number of voices at the end of 2005. Three other voices were saying in 2004: “Decrease rates, please.” We did not change our course of action. It’s the same today. We do what we have to do. It is for that reason we have the trust of those who are expressing inflationary expectations, long-term inflationary expectations. They can trust that we will do what we have to do and not react to, I would say, erratic inputs. As regards the salaries of the Executive Board, we publish the sum of salaries of the Executive Board Members. First of all, if the Japanese central bank changes progressively the course of its monetary policy it is for very good reasons. Governor Fukui and the Monetary Policy Council have very good reasons to do that and they are doing it certainly for the sake of the medium and long-term price stability and therefore prosperity of their own country, within their own responsibility and, by way of consequence, for the sake of the rest of the world. The same is true in the US and here in the euro area. It is certainly not to be judged as contributing to global difficulties. On the contrary, I would say. What we do is contributing to long-term, medium to long-term, stability. I have no particular comment on what has happened in the various markets you mentioned. Of course, we are analysing that but we have no particular comment on that. "
02/03/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today’s meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability that we have identified on the basis of both our economic and monetary analyses. The adjustment of interest rates will contribute to ensuring that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, which is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum still remain at very low levels in both nominal and real terms, and our monetary policy remains accommodative. While this policy stance reflects our current assessment, we will continue to monitor closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the euro area was 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005. This was considerably lower than the strong 0.6% recorded in the previous quarter. However, looking through the short-term volatility and assessing recent economic indicators and survey information, the evidence suggests that economic activity is improving. Accordingly, we should see stronger growth rates over the short term, as also reflected in various indicator-based estimates. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for ongoing economic expansion in the euro area. The external environment remains favourable, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring and gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should also strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves. The March ECB staff macroeconomic projections have provided an additional input into our analysis of the prospects for economic activity. These projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.7% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2007. The results constitute a slight upward revision to the Eurosystem staff projections of December 2005, mainly reflecting a somewhat stronger outlook for private investment over the projection horizon. Most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions give a broadly similar picture. In the view of the Governing Council, downside risks to this outlook for growth relate mainly to oil price developments and global imbalances. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.3% in February 2006, compared with 2.4% in January. In the short run, inflation rates are likely to remain at above 2%, with the precise levels depending strongly on future energy price developments, which have recently been relatively volatile. Beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to significantly affect inflation in 2006 and 2007, and an upward impact can also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. At the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate over the recent past; our working assumption is that this will continue to be the case, due not least to strong global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Moderate wage trends have helped to contain domestic inflationary pressure despite strong oil price increases. Therefore, looking ahead, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. Further input into our assessment of the outlook for price developments is again provided by the March ECB staff projections. Annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.9% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007. Compared with the December 2005 Eurosystem staff projections, these ranges imply a slight upward revision to the profile for HICP inflation over the coming years, reflecting mainly an increase in the assumption for future oil prices, in line with market expectations. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger wage and price developments than expected due to second-round effects of past oil price increases. Turning to the monetary analysis, the Governing Council has again discussed the assessment of monetary developments in depth. The annual growth rate of M3 remains robust, notwithstanding signs of a resumption of the unwinding of past portfolio shifts into monetary assets, which exerts a dampening effect on headline M3 growth. Looking through the short-term effects generated by such portfolio behaviour, the trend rate of monetary expansion remains strong, reflecting the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates. Moreover, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector has strengthened further over recent months, with borrowing by households – especially loans for house purchase – and non-financial corporations rising at a marked pace. Overall, strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity in the euro area points to risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, and the economic analysis indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. Given the strength of monetary growth and the ample liquidity situation, cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability prevail. An adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted. By acting in a timely fashion, the Governing Council is helping to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability and thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. As regards fiscal policies, while some countries plan to maintain or attain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus over the horizon of their stability programmes, progress towards sound public finances in the euro area as a whole remains slow. A number of countries continue to report severe imbalances, and in some of them consolidation efforts barely attain the minimum required by the revised Stability and Growth Pact, despite the improving growth outlook. At the same time, the fiscal costs of population ageing cast a shadow over the long-term fiscal outlook for most euro area countries. It is therefore essential that countries pursue a more determined consolidation, introducing concrete and effective measures where needed. These consolidation efforts will more easily succeed if they are embedded in a comprehensive reform programme that adequately prepares for the long-term fiscal challenges. This will enhance the credibility of the revised Pact and create confidence in a sound and growth-friendly fiscal environment. The broader implications of population ageing also require attention in other fields of economic policy. Comprehensive structural reforms in labour and product markets and the creation of a favourable and competitive environment for firms are vital to support potential growth and raise employment rates as the demographic effects materialise. Completing the EU internal market – including the market for services – should be a key priority. On the labour supply side, tax and benefit system reforms are essential to provide stronger incentives for people to stay in or enter the labour market. On the labour demand side, there is a need to promote wage flexibility and address labour market rigidities. Moreover, better education and training are important for the development of human capital. The forthcoming meeting of the European Council on 23-24 March 2006 will review progress made with the Lisbon strategy, which was relaunched last year. We strongly support the initiatives taken by the European Commission and the European Council to revive this reform process. A full and effective realisation of the necessary reforms is the key to the long-term economic success of the European Union. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  First of all, we have increased rates today. Our monetary policy stance today, after this increase, reflects our current assessment. We will continue to monitor closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability. It is the state of mind that we have. As regards the future, we will decide to move on the basis of the facts, figures and data, and on our future assessment of the risks to price stability. As you know, we never pre-commit ourselves unconditionally. So we will do what is required of us to ensure price stability, to be credible in ensuring price stability and to continue anchoring inflationary expectations – as we have done up till now. That is a major contribution for a very favourable financial environment. The market participants, observers, savers and investors can see what we have been doing; they know what our monetary policy concept is; and they know how we implement this monetary concept. Papademos: I have to pass the question to the President. We have already been very clear on that point. We will decide in the Executive Board with Lucas and all our colleagues including our new colleague when he is appointed. It is a collegial decision. And we will of course communicate immediately our decision. Today’s decision is in our opinion the right decision in line with our present analysis and our assessment of the risks to price stability. We will see how the situation develops and whether the new assessments of risks to price stability lead us to take new decisions. In order to complete the previous response to the previous such question, we are very much in the same state of mind as we were after the December decision. There are two messages: first we did not decide today ex ante on a series of monthly increases, as other central banks might have done; at the same time, we stand ready to do whatever is necessary and appropriate to ensure price stability and anchor inflationary expectations and to continue to contribute, through that anchoring of inflationary expectations, to a favourable financial environment. On the first question, the clear message we received from families, from households, from our 313 million fellow citizens is to ensure price stability. They are saying that in all surveys that we can observe. The message is very strong. They are not necessarily fully satisfied with the present level of inflation, as appears in a lot of surveys, and they are calling upon us to meet our responsibilities, which are given to us by the Treaty. As you know, it is an immense responsibility, and we will continue to be faithful to our mandate, because it is essential. Not only in the view of the market anchoring of inflationary expectations, but also, because it is a major contribution to the overall confidence of consumers and households. On to of that because we are credible, we incorporate, in medium and long-term market rates, a low level of inflationary expectations, which is obviously good for the families you were talking about. On the second question, I would say that we did not discuss any particular dossier. I will only refer to the constant position expressed already by the Governing Council, which is strongly in favour of the completion of the Single Market. I said that a number of times: we are expecting all rules of the European Single Market to be respected. That is the constant sentiment of the Governing Council.  I told you that we will continue to monitor closely all developments that could modify our assessment of the risks to price stability. We do not engage a priori in a series of interest rate hikes, but we will do all that is necessary any time. And you know that we do not pre-commit ourselves unconditionally. And I am giving that information to the markets: again, I feel that we are very much in the same mood as we were in December. First we consider that there was good reason to increase rates and the present level reflects our assessment of the situation at the present moment. Second, as regards the projections, as you know, the Governing Council does not underwrite the projections. Both the projections of the staff of the ECB and the projections of the staff of the Eurosystem are made by our experts. We have a lot of trust in them – in their professionalism and in their excellent work – but we do not underwrite this information and we look also at all other pertinent information. I confirm that the methodology you mentioned as regards interest rates is the present methodology for the staff projections. Our aim is to be as certain as possible, with the best analysis possible, that we are at any given moment in time putting our monetary policy stance in line with what we feel the risks are for future inflation. We trust that, at the present time, today’s decision is the good one. And again, we will what will be necessary in the future depending on the data, facts and figures. I was expecting a number of questions relating to the question asked by an Italian journalist and I will tell you exactly the same. We did not discuss any particular dossier – I think you have in mind one particular dossier – and it is our previous constant position that the European rules of the Single Market have to be respected. This is our long standing position already expressed today. In advance not only to Italian and Spanish journalists but also to the Luxembourg journalists, French journalists, German journalists I will give the same response to all such questions. Turning to the question on the interest rate differentials that you asked…. Again, we have a single currency area, we have a single monetary policy, we have the same interest rates and we have to make up our minds on the basis of all 313 million people in the euro area. It is a very heavy responsibility and we have to look at the full picture. We cannot concentrate on any particular country, Spain for instance. We also know how different the situation is between Germany and other economies. When we took today’s decision we considered all the information contained in the monetary analysis – not only in the evolution of M3 but also in the evolution of the counterpart of M3 – such as loans including loans for housing. Clearly we have a number of indications that require careful monitoring and are, among many other considerations, explaining today’s decision. In the case of Spain it seems to me that we are observing today a certain appeasement vis-à-vis the previous evolution. Again, we look at the full picture for the euro area. On the first point, we weighed the assets and liabilities, the pros and cons, associated with various possibilities: zero increase, 25 basis points and 50 basis points. We were unanimous that 25 basis points was the appropriate decision to take today. As regards vigilance, I already responded clearly and I will not elaborate more on that. As regards the position that we have on the Single Market, the constant position of the Governing Council is that it is important for all the European rules of the Single Market to be respected. But again, we did not discuss any particular dossier and we did not discuss either today’s Financial Times. As regards the reason why we increase rates today, it reflects our assessment of all the risks to price stability that we see. We are doing it to counter these inflationary risks. The economic evolution is for us pertinent to the extent that it modifies the risks for inflation. Do not forget that there is a needle in our compass, and it is price stability. We will see what happens; we take no a priori commitment. We are reasoning over the medium term and we have to be sure that we are countering these risks. The economic analysis is very important. The monetary analysis is also important particularly for the medium to longer-term perspective. This monetary analysis gives information which we consider pertinent and which is also pointing in the direction of risks to price stability in a somewhat longer term perspective. You mentioned the possibility that our own assessment of future inflation could be lower. We will see, but do not forget that we have an economic analysis and a cross-checking with a monetary analysis. First of all, as I say very often, we look at trends and it is absolutely normal that we have had a good deal of volatility in the day-to-day figures concerning soft data and hard data. What is important for us is our assessment of the trends evolution. I will not comment too much on what we have been observing in one particular, very important euro area economy recently because what counts for us is the full body of the euro area. But some German figures are clearly a good sign, there is no doubt. We will see whether it corresponds to an “inflection” point. What is absolutely clear is that in our analysis, which is shared by economists and observers particularly in international institutions, after having had a clear driving force coming from the external side, then having seen perhaps since the middle of last year, an important contribution to growth coming from investment and gross capital formation, it would be in line with the normal sequencing to have now a significant contribution coming from consumption. I would say particularly in Germany, where the situation has been very depressed for a very long period of time for reasons that are very well known. Again it is a working assumption that we will have a significant contribution to growth coming through that channel. I will not say that we have already seen the “inflection” point. It is clear that it is our sentiment that it should materialise at some point in the present episode of the recovery. You had another question, Madam? Same thing, it is not a reason for us to change our present assessment, certainly not to change the projections which have just been made, but we will see whether beyond the inevitable volatility of these figures there is something more permanent. I have mentioned the risks to price stability coming from the delay in incorporating in non oil prices the previous oil prices increases. It is clearly one of the risks that we have to be fully aware of. We consider a priori that there is an opportunity cost which is significant not to complete the Single Market in a convincing manner. But again we have not discussed any of these particular dossiers. Certainly not. This is not the present methodology. Regarding the first question, I said that we were in the same state of mind as we were in following December’s decision. You can draw the conclusion that you will judge appropriate for that observation. As regards the soft versus hard data, it is clear that until now in a number of economies, and therefore at the level of the euro area as a whole, we have a number of so-called soft data that are very good, obviously even historically good in some very important economies, including the German economy. At the same time, we have maybe not yet seen the following hard data confirming the soft data. But historically, we always observed in the past that the hard data followed suit soft data. There was a strong correlation. As I said, we are very pragmatic, we depend on the information that we receive and we will examine all new information as it comes in each month or each quarter. What is important for us is to eliminate the noise from the data and filter out the pertinent information which for us, of course, taking into account our medium-term reasoning, is the trend. As regards the Stability and Growth Pact, we have always said that, first of all, the new Pact, as amended unanimously by all governments, had to be rigorously implemented. This is the first observation. The second observation is that we always said that we expected each partner to fulfil its responsibility. So I will tell you what our position will be when we see exactly what the Commission the German Government and the Council positions are. On the first question, I would say the following. First of all, 2.5% is, in nominal terms, the lowest level ever attained by the Bundesbank, since the creation of the Bundesbank. That is just to give you an order of magnitude and the possibility to make a comparison. It is a stimulative monetary policy – there is no doubt about that. As regards the monetary policy of Japan, I have said in the past that central bankers have created a strong brotherhood of mutual admiration! So, what the Bank of Japan does is good and what the Bank of Japan will do will be good. I will not make any further comments on the monetary policy of Japan. First, it was not on the agenda. Second, it is not on our normal agenda. The responsible public entities in this respect, apart from the Governments involved, are the European Commission and the Council. I would add to what I have already said: each institution must meet its responsibilities, ours are already very heavy! I mentioned that when I was referring to the monetary analysis. We consider monetary analysis to be important under our two pillar strategy not only because it permits us to cross-check the economic analysis but also because it gives us particular information on the risks from the medium to the longer-term horizons. That was why I mentioned that. As you know, the measurement of the output gap is not part of our monetary policy concept. We believe that when you look at the immediate, real-time estimate of the output gap, and then you look at the same analysis of the output gap one year afterwards, or two years afterwards, you see such huge differences that you have to be cautious. I fully understand that a number of observers and economists would look at it, but we are very cautious in this respect. It is not part of our own monetary policy concept. I would not embark on my present estimate of it, precisely for that reason. We trust that it is a concept which is extremely delicate to manipulate. Trichet : I said that there is certainly no such rule as increases every month! There is no rule to increase every three months! We increase rates if necessary when we judge it to be appropriate. Questions: A few people in the financial markets have been observing that the European Central Bank seems not to have changed interest rates on occasions when it has been meeting outside of Frankfurt. In June it is going to be in Madrid. Would that be an inopportune time to be changing rates? You can draw any conclusion from past observations, of course, but I have always said that we could act whenever needed. Do not conclude that I am confirming anything! We will do whatever will be necessary when the time comes. We have always said that we should make the future decision clearly, with a rigorous observation of the Maastricht criteria. Nothing more than the criteria and nothing less than the criteria. I will not comment in any other fashion. As regards the debt outstanding, I only remind you that the wording of the Treaty is not exactly the same in the case of the 3% threshold on the current deficit which I cherish personally because I introduced myself the 3% threshold when we negotiated the Maastricht Treaty and in the case of the 60% threshold for accumulated debt, which is of a different nature and is not qualified in the same fashion in the wording of the Treaty. That was my response to the last question. Now I have to mention that we did decide something else during our meeting and that information is being made public right now. I think that it is courteous for me to tell you that we have decided that Mr. Jürgen Stark is a person of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters as required by the Treaty of Maastricht. So we have expressed our positive opinion and we are now communicating this positive opinion to the respective institutions of Europe. "
02/02/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We have also concluded that the most recent information from the economic analysis broadly underpins our assessment of the outlook for price developments and the euro area economy, and that monetary and credit growth remains strong and liquidity ample. Against this background, we will exercise vigilance so as to ensure the solid anchoring of long-term inflation expectations at levels in line with price stability. Such vigilance is also warranted, given the historically low levels of both nominal and real interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum and the overall accommodative stance of monetary policy. In order for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and employment in the euro area, inflation expectations must be firmly anchored. Let me now explain our assessment in more detail. Turning first to the economic analysis, recent data continue to lend support to the scenario for economic activity embodied in the December 2005 Eurosystem staff projections. Hence, our assessment of the outlook for growth in the euro area has been broadly confirmed. Economic activity started to improve and broaden in the second half of 2005 and, on the basis of the latest indicators and survey data, it appears that this process has basically continued, taking into account the usual degree of volatility of quarterly growth rates. Looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for economic growth to continue over the coming quarters. The external environment is favourable, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should also strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves. This outlook for economic activity is also confirmed by available forecasts. Downside risks to economic growth, relating, in particular, to persistently high and volatile oil prices and concerns about global imbalances, still dominate on the external side. In relation to price developments, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in December, down from 2.3% in November and 2.5% in October. Over the short term, annual inflation rates may again increase somewhat, reflecting in particular renewed increases in energy prices and some base effects. Looking further ahead, indirect effects of past oil price rises on other components of the price index may gradually materialise, and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes can be expected to have an upward impact on HICP inflation. Meanwhile, wage dynamics have remained moderate over recent quarters and are assumed to remain so for the time being, reflecting, in particular, global competitive pressure. All in all, currently available information is broadly in line with the scenario embodied in the December 2005 Eurosystem staff projections for HICP inflation over this year and next. Risks to this outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further rises in oil prices, a pass-through of oil prices into consumer prices stronger than currently envisaged, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – potential second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 remains robust, even though it moderated further in December. This moderation can be explained in part by an apparent resumption of the unwinding of past portfolio shifts, which exerts a dampening effect on headline M3 growth. However, the trend rate of monetary expansion remains strong, reflecting the stimulative impact of the prevailing low level of interest rates. In particular, growth in the most liquid components of M3 continues to be very robust and the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has increased further. Mortgage borrowing is particularly buoyant, implying a need to monitor developments in the housing market closely. Overall, strong monetary and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity in the euro area points to risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that indirect effects stemming from past oil price rises and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes can be expected to have an upward impact on annual HICP inflation over the coming years. It also indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. Cross-checking the outcome of our economic analysis with that of our monetary analysis supports the case for vigilance to ensure that the risks to price stability over the medium to longer term do not materialise. It is indeed essential that such risks do not affect medium and long-term inflation expectations, which need to remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. This is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation As regards fiscal policy, recent information points to somewhat better than expected outcomes for 2005 in a number of countries and for the euro area as a whole. With the improvements in economic growth, determined fiscal consolidation is now even more important. In particular, countries with excessive deficits must take this opportunity to reduce their fiscal imbalances in a decisive and sustainable manner. This would strongly support the European fiscal framework as established by the Stability and Growth Pact. Delaying consolidation would be both inappropriate in the short term and risky in the longer term. Adjustment efforts should be based on credible, fully specified measures as part of a comprehensive consolidation programme. Any windfall gains from higher than expected growth or other factors should be allocated to speeding up deficit reduction. This would help to prevent a repeat of past experiences, when complacency in good times contributed to persistent budgetary disequilibria. With respect to structural reforms, the Governing Council discussed a range of issues relating to the euro area services sector. Services-related activities represent an important input for other sectors of the economy and account for a large, growing share of output and employment in the euro area, standing, in both cases, at around 70% in recent years. Given the services sector’s increasingly important role, the need to ensure a fully integrated internal market for services in the European Union is at the forefront of the European policy agenda. Structural reforms aimed at increasing competition in both EU and international services markets would allow firms to benefit from economies of scale and should be expected to increase economic efficiency. This would support both a higher level and stronger growth rate of labour productivity in the services sector, promote a more dynamic economy and create more jobs. Moreover, a higher level of competition in the services market should have a dampening impact on prices and would contribute to the reduction of price stickiness in some areas of the services sector. Overall, opening up the services sector to new entrants would tend to foster more efficient and flexible services markets, facilitate adjustment processes and increase the resilience of the euro area to economic shocks. This would support economic growth and employment in the longer run. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  And my second question is: Markets are expecting another rate increase in the first quarter and yet another one – at least one more, anyway – by the end of the year. Would you repeat again this month, as you did last month, that markets have taken your message well? First, I have mentioned the word “vigilance” three times and I am happy that you have noticed that. Second, as regards the market expectations for future action in a short period of time – what I am observing seems to be reasonable. Looking at all the information we have and taking into account our baseline scenario that assumption has been broadly confirmed by all what we have observed. Over a longer period of time, I would only say that we will continue to do whatever is needed to ensure the delivery of price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. I would say that our working assumption on growth has been broadly confirmed by all what we have observed. I would also confirm that our own staff projections at this stage are a good point of reference. I see no reason, at the moment, to change anything. When we have the new staff projections, we will see what they indicate and what kind of new information they contain. As regards the risks to growth, I have mentioned that it is on the external side that we see the major risks. Oil prices are on top of the list of risks – certainly in the eyes of this institution, and also in the eyes of all others – and there is also the issue of imbalances. These are the two major risks that I have been mentioning. There are others, of course, and these are well known. I will respond to the second question first. Otmar Issing was a team member of extraordinary quality – and he still is, because he has not yet left. And we are still benefiting from his presence in our team. I will not elaborate at all on what decision the Executive Board will take when the time comes. But we will take that decision together with our new colleague. On the first question: We are looking at what is necessary for Europe. We have been credible since the setting‑up of the euro seven years ago. And, as we have always said, and as my predecessor always said, we incorporate all pertinent information to see what the risks to price stability are and what the appropriate response is in order to cope with those risks. Again, delivering price stability and being credible over time in delivering price stability – there is no other consideration. And the second question is once again about your language: You mentioned last month that the Council was monitoring price stability risks very closely; today you used the word “ vigilance” . Can you tell us whether you believe that risks to price stability have escalated since 12 January? On the downside risks – and there I am not on the external, but on the domestic, side of the coin – I would say that since Q2 and Q3 of last year we have observed something materialising which had been expected for quite a period of time, namely the pick-up in investment. If my memory serves me correctly, we had quarter-on-quarter growth of around 0.4% in the second quarter of last year; half of it was due to the contribution of gross capital formation, i.e. 0.2% out of 0.4%. And, again, in the third quarter it was 0.6%, and half of it, 0.3%, was due to gross capital formation, according to the present data. You know that those data are corrected, but it is what we have at present. It was really something which was important and had been expected because the normal sequencing, as you know, is that you have first, in the period of recovery, a contribution of net exports, then a contribution of investment and then consumption. So we will see – but what is expected by observers and economists – and is incorporated in our own staff projections – is a progressive pick-up in consumption, which is the third, “episode” in the sequencing. As I said, we are very pragmatic and we will see exactly what happens – but it would obviously be the normal sequencing. You had a second question: I would say, to the extent that we see the development of this ongoing economic expansion, we see risks progressively augmenting Well, it was the first time that Mario Draghi was here. I welcome him very warmly on behalf of the Governing Council. Most of us, and it is certainly the case for me, have known Mario for a very long period. We worked with him when he was Under Secretary of the Italian Treasury; he played a very important role in the modernisation of the Italian economy. He has a fantastic reputation and, again, we are very happy to work with him. So I am looking forward to our continued cooperation; and, of course, within the Eurosystem, the Banca d’Italia is a very important member of the team, and we will continue to maintain the closest possible relationship with this institution, in line with the team spirit which characterises the Eurosystem. First of all, we call upon social partners to have a responsible attitude, and this is obviously very important. As I said, until now we have not seen second-round effects in this domain. We are very happy with that. In any case, central banks should not wait for second-round effects to act. What we have to do is to prevent the second-round effects from materialising. So I will continue to convey exactly the same message: vigilance and social responsibility on the part of social partners, and I will say no more than that. In any case, when you look at the functioning of the economy, you have to take into account the situation of each particular entity, of each particular corporate business – and what counts, of course, is to be competitive and to be up to the European and international competition which is the hallmark of our time. First point. I was very happy that observers, journalists, yourselves and markets understood in December that we were not embarking upon a sequence of rate increases at every meeting. It could have been a possible interpretation, because, as you know, another major central bank had embarked upon such a concept. It was very important for us to convey the message that it was not what we had decided on; we had decided on a move, but we had not decided “a priori” to move at every meeting. You yourself got it and the market got it. At the same time, I said that we would continue to do what was necessary to ensure price stability and to ensure appropriate anchoring of long-term inflation expectations which relies entirely upon our credibility. And, again, we have no intention of changing the messages communicated to you in December – it is exactly the same two messages which we are conveying. That being said, I have added today that what I see as regards the very short-term expectations of future moves seems to be reasonable, taking into account all the information I have. Second point: again, we consider that when we take a decision, be it a decision to increase rates or leave rates unchanged or whatever, we are confident that it is what is needed at the time we take the decision in order to continue to cope appropriately with the risks for inflation. And we integrate all the information we have on all fronts. It’s a very complex process: there is no mechanistic decision. We have to work out a synthesis on the basis of all the information we have, and on the basis of our own framework: the needle of the compass is price stability. What can clearly be observed, and I am very happy about this, is that the decision we took in December, which was to some extent challenged “a priori”, has been very well understood. Last point, the Treaty is the Treaty. The criteria are the criteria. The countries that have joined the European Union will be examined in the next Convergence report on the basis of the Treaty and the criteria. They are very clear and, as you know, they call for the criteria to be met, not only on an immediate, short-term basis but on a sustainable basis – and that is what we will do, as we have done in the past. And we will see what the results are. I don’t want to “gossip” a priori about the various positions of the countries concerned. Yes, very well. I’m not sure if I understand the question correctly. But we think that it was exactly what we had to do and there is no doubt about that. No, I didn’t say that! I also said that we had increased vigilance and, as you noted, I not only said that our vigilance had increased, but I mentioned it three times. In reply to the first question, in the introductory remark I mentioned that there was a certain degree of volatility from quarter to quarter. What we are looking at is the trend. We had quit a number of information and you mentioned only those that are not encouraging. You could also have mentioned, of course, a lot of information which were much more encouraging, including a number of surveys from all over Europe, not only this country in particular. So again on the basis of all the information we have to date, we consider that there is no case for changing our own baseline scenario. That said, I also stated that we were pragmatic and that we have always respected the facts. What counts is reality. That’s absolutely clear but, again, there is no reason today to change the baseline scenario. As regards the risks, I explicitly mentioned the downside risks for growth and the international risks that are there and should not be forgotten. Concerning what you said about the influence of our interest rate increases first let me re-state that everything we do is aimed at being faithful to our mandate and being credible in delivering price stability. Delivering price stability permits medium and long-term market rates to remain well in order because then they incorporate a low level of inflation expectations. I would not ask you to remind me of the interest rates before the euro in the country that you have been mentioning, and what the interest rate would be in that country if there was not an institution here – namely the ECB - which is credible in the eyes of Europe and the rest of the world. Let me tell you that only one person expresses the sentiment of the Governing Council of the ECB: the President. I have already said that once and I will respond to your question, of course, but I mention that “en passant”. Mr Bini Smaghi is one of the 18 members of the Governing Council. He does not speak on behalf of the Governing Council. No, he does not speak on behalf of the Board. He made that remark as a personal remark. It is as simple as that. We do not have 18 speakers to communicate the position of the Governing Council. To the extent that what is at stake is the position of the ECB itself and if there is any doubt on the ECB position, yes, you got it perfectly right. We did not constrain ourselves in advance with any kind of quantities. Second, as always, we have weighed thoroughly the assets and liabilities associated with various possibilities, and we did that as thoroughly as usual. And I have expressed in the introductory remarks and in response to your question the overall sentiment of the Governing Council. Yes, certainly. First of all, Arcelor and Mittal Steel are not in the services sector, if I may say so we will not discuss that at all. We discussed the services sector issue and we noted that in a modern economy the services sector is overwhelmingly dominant, that is clear. We mentioned the fact that we were at the level of 70% of both GDP and employment as regards the proportion of the various services sector. For us it is the overwhelmingly dominant part of the economy and when we look more precisely at the functioning of the services sector we see the extent to which there is still a good deal of stickiness. The single market has not yet been achieved in the services sector, so we have a potential source of inflation which is superior to what it should be if it had been achieved. We also have the issue of labour productivity progress that is lower probably precisely because the single market has not been achieved in this domain. It is particularly clear if we compare the evolution of labour productivity in the services sector here and across the Atlantic. So, there is a lot of reflection and I expressed in the introductory remarks what the Governing Council would think on that point. Again, we have to be fully conscious that the services sector is very important. It is by far the largest part of any modern economy and of any knowledge economy. Well he is already part of the brotherhood, the fraternity, of central bankers. He has been a very good friend in the Federal Reserve System before. This is an occasion to mention that I see Alan going with great emotion. We have been working with Alan Greenspan for a long period of time. He has been a very close colleague in the bilateral relationship, in the G7, in the G10, in the G20. He has been a close friend. His personal qualities on top of his professional qualities are exceptional and he has been one of the best companions you can imagine. I also mention the fact that he has been extremely lucid in analysing situations I just spoke of labour productivity progress. He has been particularly lucid in diagnosing the labour productivity progress in the United States starting in 1995-96. It was not easy to realise that something extremely important was changing at that time. And unfortunately it was not changing in Europe and we are paying a certain price for the fact that our own labour productivity progress was not at all parallel to that in the United States. But even in the United States, it was not easy to diagnose what was happening. And he did it very rapidly and lucidly. As you know, we did not agree entirely on the concept of monetary policy. We have a lot in common, for instance, the fact that we do not want to be prisoner, on both sides of the Atlantic, of a particular equation, of a system of equations. We want to be as comprehensive as possible in the economic analysis. That is a point where we are very close. There is a point where we were not that close. We are extremely attached to a definition of price stability and to anchoring inflation expectations to that definition of price stability, which we display very clearly. On the other side of the Atlantic, for a number of reasons which I respect, it was not the sentiment of our friend Alan Greenspan and of the Federal Reserve System. All that being said he made an immense contribution to the brotherhood, the fraternity as you say, of central bankers and I hope very much that we will remain in close touch. With Mr Bernanke of course we have been in contact. I was very happy to congratulate him when he was nominated and then appointed, and I am sure that we will continue to have the closest possible relationship on both sides of the Atlantic. He has an immense responsibility with his colleagues of the Federal Open Market Committee, we have our own responsibility here in the Governing Council and we will continue to cooperate very closely. We will see. Everybody knows what the sentiment of Ben has been. I do not want to comment. I have said all that I had to say, and it is very clear. And I think that your colleagues have no doubts about what I have said. We incorporate all the information obtained over the months. Clearly, we will have our new staff projections, and this is something which we will look at, but, again, let’s not give greater weight to any particular piece of information. What we do is to incorporate all the information we have – there is the trend, there is the short-term information and data, and there is the “noise” that we have to extract from the information we have – and we will see. But I wouldn’t say, at all, that we did not decide today because we wanted to wait for something. We thought, taking into account the trend of the baseline scenario and taking into account the risks to price stability, according to our analysis of their presence and their dynamics, that it was the right decision not to move this time whilst, at the same time, clearly, we have increased vigilance and I also commented on what is presently expected by markets. I will not elaborate on that question. I would say that the functioning of the markets is the functioning of the markets. I will not qualify the present level. All I would say is that, from the information I would extract from stock market – over the period of time you have in mind – what I call our baseline scenario seems to be confirmed and certainly not negated. On the first question again we look at reliable information and we extract from stock market that information what we consider to be the trend. I will not comment in any other fashion on what we in the Governing Council may do. I have already said all that I had to say. I maintain that we are humble in the face of the reality. Regarding differences between “hard” figures and “soft” figures, these are difficult concepts. So-called hard figures change a great deal. You have a hard figure at a certain point in time, then one month later it is reviewed and revised and it goes up or down, and then two months later it is again revised up or down. Let’s also be cautious about that distinction between soft and hard. It is a very complex set of information. We have to extract all this information, make up our minds and take the decision under the scrutiny of the observers and the market. To date, the Governing Council of the ECB has remained credible over time in difficult circumstances, including a number of shocks, and we have taken all the appropriate decisions to maintain the anchoring of inflation expectations, again, in times which were not easy – and this is not an easy period either. Very good question. We never said that we were deciding our monetary policy simultaneously with the publication of the projections and I confirm that it is absolutely not the intention of the Governing Council to always decide on the basis of projections. I would also mention the fact that the Governing Council, as I have said already, does not itself underwrite the projections. They are our staff projections, we do not make the staff projections necessarily Governing Council projections. We look at all other information that comes from international institutions and private institutions. I don’t of course rule out the possibility that we could decide at that time, but there is certainly no rule and it has to be very clear. I say very often that we can decide at any time. We have never promised not to move, or not to move for a considerable period of time. Also, we never decided “a priori” to say that we will move at every meeting, and so forth. We are free. We always remain free to do what is necessary to do at any time. "
12/01/2006,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I would first like to express to all of you our best wishes for the New Year and welcome you to this press conference. Let me now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged following the increase of 25 basis points on 1 December 2005. The information which has become available since then supports the assessment that an adjustment of our very accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted. It remains essential to keep medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Maintaining price stability over the medium term is our guiding principle, and we will consistently apply it when examining new information, making our judgements and taking decisions. With interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum remaining historically low in both nominal and real terms, and with our monetary policy stance remaining accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability over the medium term. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, turning first to the economic analysis. According to the information available, real GDP growth did indeed improve in the second half of 2005, as we expected. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, real GDP grew at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.6% in the third quarter of 2005, compared with 0.4% in the second quarter. The breakdown of GDP data for the third quarter of 2005 confirmed a stronger contribution from domestic demand. Moreover, recent economic indicators and survey data support the view that the expansion of economic activity broadly maintained its momentum in the fourth quarter of 2005 and will continue to do so in the first months of 2006, notwithstanding the impact of high oil prices. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for sustained growth of economic activity, in line with our staff projections and other available forecasts. On the external side, the continued strength of global demand should support euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should further benefit from continued very favourable financing conditions, robust corporate earnings and gains in corporate efficiency. Consumption growth should gradually rise, broadly in line with expected developments in disposable income. Risks to this outlook for economic growth continue to lie on the downside and relate to high and volatile oil prices, concerns about global imbalances and the level of consumer confidence in the euro area, although the latter is improving. Turning to price developments, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in December, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 2.3% in November and 2.5% in October. This decline was the result of some relaxation of earlier tensions in oil and petrol markets. Nevertheless, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to remain at elevated levels over the short term, mainly on account of the most recent increases in oil prices and some adverse base effects. Beyond the short term, indirect effects of past oil price rises on other components of the price index may gradually materialise, and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes can be expected to have an upward impact. Meanwhile, wage increases have remained moderate over recent quarters. All in all, the information available remains consistent with the scenario for price developments as reflected in the December staff projections. Risks to this scenario remain on the upside and include further rises in oil prices, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as – more fundamentally – potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 moderated somewhat in November, but remained very robust, mainly owing to the stimulative impact of the prevailing low level of interest rates. The strong growth of M3 continues to be driven by significant contributions from its most liquid components. The growth of loans to the private sector – and, in particular, mortgage borrowing – has strengthened further over recent months, from already rapid rates of growth. Against this background, price dynamics in the housing markets need to be monitored closely. Liquidity in the euro area remains ample by all plausible measures. Strong monetary and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity in the euro area points to upside risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that some upward impact on HICP inflation will result from the indirect effects of recent oil price rises and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes. It also indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. This assessment is confirmed by cross-checking the economic analysis with the monetary analysis. It is essential that such risks do not affect medium-term inflation expectations, which need to remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Monetary policy can thereby effectively contribute to sustainable economic growth and job creation. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability over the medium term. As regards fiscal policy, most euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes, which include their medium-term budget plans. The upcoming assessment of these programmes by the ECOFIN Council and their subsequent implementation provide an opportunity to forcefully underpin the commitment to sound fiscal policies and the rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. This would have an important positive effect on confidence. This effect is likely to be considerable if emphasis is given to well-defined and credible consolidation measures, restraint in expenditure commitments, and the incorporation of fiscal measures into a comprehensive and growth-friendly reform agenda. With respect to structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomes the ECOFIN Council’s Conclusions of 6 December 2005 on the Lisbon National Reform Programmes and the intended response to the challenges of globalisation. In fact, the process of international economic and financial integration, characterised by strong growth in trade and capital flows, has been one of the driving factors behind the rise in Europe’s prosperity over the past decades. The ongoing transformation of the world economy, reflecting technological advances and the entrance of new economies into the world market, again offers great opportunities in terms of higher living standards. In order to translate these chances into achievements, Europe would greatly benefit from more flexible labour and product markets so as to speed up the necessary changeover from contracting to expanding activities and to minimise adjustment costs. It would also profit considerably from a more stimulative business environment which fosters the ability to innovate, invest and create new firms. Moreover, a fully operational EU internal market, including for services, offers great opportunities. The initiatives taken to relaunch the Lisbon strategy are a welcome step in the right direction. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  First, we were unanimous in taking today’s decision. We all held that all the information at our disposal called for the decision that was taken, that you, of course, knew of before this press conference. Second, all the information at our disposal since our decision of the beginning of December confirmed our working assumption that we were progressively reaching a rate of growth in the euro area that was close to potential, at potential or around potential. We, of course, remain pragmatic – we depend on facts and figures that we examine very carefully, as always. All the information we have received since December has confirmed our working assumptions. As regards our discussion: as always, each one of us is weighing the risks to price stability. That is what we are called upon to do – both individually and collectively – in the Governing Council, i.e. the competent entity for taking decisions. The wisdom of a “college” relies on a deep exchange of views and discussion, as well as on the fact that each member can change his/her own understanding as a result of the remarks made by – in our case – 17 other colleagues. That is how the wisdom of a “college” comes about. The wisdom of a “college” is not achieved by your coming to it with a certain view and then leaving with the same view, simply after having voted. That is not the case. You exchange views, and you reflect upon them and deepen your understanding of the situation. This is, of course, particularly important for us in the context of a single currency area. That having been said, we were unanimous in thinking that the present decision to leave the rates unchanged was the right decision. With regard to your second question, I said clearly on behalf of the Governing Council in my introductory remarks that inflation is at the level of 2.2% – a level that is, of course, over and above our definition of price stability. In the short term, we do not exclude some move upwards and for the medium term, we confirm that we have absolutely no reason to change the Eurosystem staff projections that were published on the occasion of the last press conference in December. So, I will stick to that. First, as regards our sentiment on growth in a longer term perspective. I said that we saw no reason to consider that we should modify the Eurosystem staff projections which were published in December. With regard to inflation, I would say that the same applies as for growth. We have seen absolutely no reason to change in any respect at the present moment the Eurosystem staff projections as regards inflation which have been published in December. Second, I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council that risks to growth existed and that they were on the downside. And I quoted in particular the imbalances and the oil prices. I also referred to consumer confidence in the euro area, which is improving, but remains low. On the two first points there is clearly a risk which we take note of. As I said, we are pragmatic and we fully respect the facts and figures. I would not embark on any kind of “gossip” in answering the part of your question which relates to how we should act in view of possible risks stemming from a slowing down of the global or US economy. With regard to the perceptions of observers and market participants, I would say that European and global investors and savers have pretty well captured the message we communicated at the last press conference in December. From that standpoint, I confirm that, from our own perspective, the message has been well-received and interpreted, including as regards what is presently in the market for possible future decisions. As regards future decisions, as you pointed out, I mentioned twice that we would monitor the situation “very closely”. We look at growth from a perspective that goes above and beyond quarter-on-quarter figures. As you know, quarter-on-quarter figures are very often corrected. We have to fully respect the methodologies applied by economists and statisticians. So I do not want to comment on one particular prior indication that the fourth quarter in one particular country might have been different from what was expected. We are reflecting on the euro area as a whole. Taking into account both so-called soft figures – surveys, polls – and hard figures, I would say that the bulk of information received since our last meeting confirms our working assumptions. I also mentioned that we were totally pragmatic and respect facts and figures. We will see, when all the figures are computed, what are the results for various economies and for the single, integrated economy of the euro area as a whole. On the sentiment of the Governing Council, I will only repeat what I have already said: we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability over the medium term and take the decisions that will be necessary. This is very clear. We have a needle in our compass and that needle in our compass points to delivering price stability, being credible in the delivery of price stability and, by way of consequence, solidly anchoring inflationary expectations. All this relies upon our own credibility. Our credibility depends on everyone knowing that we do not hesitate to act when necessary, and we have demonstrated that recently. That is well understood by observers, as I said, and certainly by market participants. We will monitor very closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability over the medium term. I already said that the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations is in a way the arithmetical illustration of our credibility because it is something which relies entirely upon our credibility. It is something which is also permitting the continued very favourable medium and long-term market rates environment. First of all, I will not comment on Nout. You will ask Nout directly what he thinks. I said that today our decision was taken unanimously. I add that perhaps each of us has his or her own way to mention the fact that we will monitor all developments very closely. There is no doubt in the mind of any market participant, observer, investor and saver that we will act and do what is necessary when it is necessary. Whatever good advice we receive from here and there, we have our own responsibilities and we will always be up to these responsibilities. They are decisive for Europe and for the prosperity of Europe: we will continue to do what is necessary. It is always time to be as sound and reasonable as possible in terms of protecting real wages .If inflation embarks on a dramatic upward movement, then as you know very well it is not good at all for workers, for employees and for households in general. We are defending price stability, and by defending price stability we are defending the purchasing power of consumers, of all households, of employees and workers. This is very important to understand. We will see again what the present state of the economy is, whether our working assumption is confirmed. Until now, everything that we have seen has confirmed our working assumption on the progressively more favourable conjuncture. I will not comment on US monetary policy. I have said what I had to say on our own monetary policy and we will see what the interest rate differentials are. As regards the imbalances, we consider that they are a risk to global growth and, of course, to economic growth in Europe too. It is a view which is not particularly original. It is shared by all “Gs” as I know. I myself recently expressed the same sentiment on behalf of the G10 at the global economy meeting in Basel: that it was one of the risks that we had to take into account when analysing and listing the risks to global growth and to growth in each particular component of the global economy. No, I really think that most of what you can hear or read here and there comes from arithmetical projections of the spot prices of oil. So, if you look at the price of oil, which is obviously very volatile, and then make projections using these different levels of the price of oil over a short to medium-term horizon, of course you find different levels of inflation. As I said, we do not consider, at this stage, that we have to change, in any respect, the present medium-term Eurosystem staff projections that we published a month ago. We stick to these staff projections as being the reference that we would consider appropriate. But because there have been downward moves in the price of oil recently followed by upward moves, we expect the profile to be volatile. We are presently at a level which some are saying is a bit lower than what they had in mind and then it will probably go upward only for the arithmetical reason that it will incorporate the most recent upward move. We are looking at the medium- term. We are not changing the Eurosystem staff medium-term reference projections. I will not comment on the exchange rates. On the first point I was not speaking on behalf of the Governing Council about particular social partner, but about all social partners and also about all price-setting mechanisms, not only wages and salaries. This is a permanent message that we have for social partners, on the one hand, and for all price-setting mechanisms on the other. As regards the economic situation, we will see whether the working assumption continues to be confirmed. Again, as I said, we are very pragmatic and respect facts and figures. It is clear that if the economy develops and continues to be at a level of growth which is significant, then it augments the risks to price stability that I have mentioned. Those risks have fortunately not materialised; but they exist, and that is the reason why we gave this message. As regards the future voting procedure, it is our law, it has been decided. We were very proud because, as you know, it was a unanimous decision of the Governing Council of the ECB which made it possible to get out of a situation which was obviously very difficult. It has been accepted by all decision-makers and it has been decided by the European Union as a whole, so we will apply the new rule. From all I have seen so far, observers, market participants and academics consider that we have a very good way of dealing with this obviously complex situation. I am extremely confident that when times come it will be applied well and will function very well. "
