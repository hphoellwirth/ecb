02/12/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB, the latter of which was attended by Mr. Niinistö, President of the EU Council. Let me first report that the Governing Council decided to confirm the reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4½% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the components underlying the derivation of the first reference value in December 1998, namely the Eurosystem's definition of price stability and the assumptions for trend real GDP growth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity, have remained unchanged. As before, the Governing Council will assess monetary developments in relation to the reference value on the basis of a three-month moving average of annual growth rates. The Governing Council has decided henceforth to review the reference value on a regular annual basis, with the next review to take place in December 2000. Against this background, the Governing Council wishes to emphasise that the trend growth potential of the euro area could be considerably enhanced by structural reform in the labour and goods markets. The Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy would take such changes into account, as appropriate. The derivation of the reference value of 4½% is an expression of a medium-term-oriented approach. The generous liquidity situation in 1999 will have to be borne in mind. The ECB will issue a press release today providing some background information on the review of the reference value carried out today by the Governing Council. The press release will also recall the role of the reference value within the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council also conducted its regular review of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area, this time including a review of the most recent forecasts and projections. After this examination, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was left at 3.0% and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and on the deposit facility were maintained at 4.0% and 2.0% respectively. Allow me to outline the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. With regard to monetary developments in the euro area, the data up to October 1999 - which still refer to the period before our decision to raise interest rates - confirmed the picture of a generous liquidity situation in the euro area. The annual growth rate of M3 in October 1999 was 6.0%. This compares with 6.2% in the previous month. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from August to October 1999, was unchanged at 6.0%, and thus stood 1½ percentage points above the reference value of 4½%. The growth of the most liquid components of M3 remained very dynamic. In addition, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to exceed 10%. As we have noted on previous occasions, these monetary and credit developments are considered to have been driven mainly by the low level of interest rates, as well as by the pick-up in economic activity in the euro area. The initial reaction of euro area financial markets to the Eurosystem's monetary policy move of last month was favourable. In particular, this was signalled by the continued decline in long-term government bond yields and the immediate substantial reduction in market uncertainty regarding the evolution of future long-term interest rates. Later in November, long-term bond yields in the euro area began to rise again gradually, in connection with developments in international bond markets and favourable expectations for world growth. Indeed, the global economic outlook remains positive, and the view that the world economy is set for higher growth appears to be shared by the major international organisations. At the same time, the expectation that growth differentials between the main economic regions will narrow in the course of time is widespread. While real GDP growth in the United States is generally expected to ease, it is expected to accelerate in the euro area. Overall, relatively wide growth differentials between the major world economies will give way to a more balanced scenario, thereby underlining the potential for the euro to appreciate. With regard to developments in economic activity in the euro area, the latest data confirm a strengthening of growth in the course of the second half of 1999. In particular, production growth in the industrial sector saw a further upturn in the third quarter and various survey data suggest that this will continue in the final quarter. All available projections indicate that this upward momentum will lead to an acceleration in real GDP growth, from around 2% this year to close to 3% in both 2000 and 2001. Consumer price increases, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), have recently resumed their upward trend, as expected. In October the annual rate of change in the overall HICP was 1.4%, up from 1.2% in September and August owing to higher price increases for food and non-energy industrial goods. The impact of higher oil prices on energy prices in the HICP, which had accounted for most of the upward pressure since June 1999, was countered in October by more moderate increases in other energy components. Some additional counterweight to the upward movement in goods prices came from a further moderation of increases in prices in the services sector. In general, the overall upward trend is expected to continue until early 2000 as a result of the increase in oil prices since spring 1999. Forecasts available suggest that price increases will nevertheless remain below 2% in the course of 2000 and 2001. However, the actual developments will very much depend on the behaviour of a number of factors, and in particular on wage developments remaining in line with price stability. In addition, our assessment has to take due account of prevailing uncertainties. On the upside, these relate to, inter alia, the behaviour of money and credit aggregates, the developments in oil prices and the path of the effective exchange rate, all of which are closely monitored with regard to their impact on price stability. On the downside, main factors are linked to the effects of deregulation and liberalisation. In conclusion, the current monetary policy stance should ensure a sustainable expansion of non-inflationary economic activity in the euro area. In line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council will remain vigilant with regard to any risks to price stability arising either from domestic or from external sources and act in a timely manner. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to introduce some of the additional topics we discussed during our meetings. The Governing Council today also took a decision on the subject of the minimum reserve system. As you may be aware, interbank liabilities are not subject to reserve requirements. In this respect, the ECB allows those credit institutions which cannot provide evidence of their interbank liabilities - in the form of debt securities issued with an agreed maturity of up to two years or money market paper - to apply a standardised deduction to the aforementioned liabilities in the computation of their reserve base. Since January 1999 this standardised deduction has been set at 10% for both types of securities. Today, following a review of new statistical evidence available, the Governing Council decided to increase the standardised deduction to 30%. This decision shall have effect as from the determination of the reserve requirement to be fulfilled in the maintenance period starting on 24 January 2000. A separate press release presenting this decision and some background information on standardised deductions from the reserve base will be issued to you here today. The Governing Council today approved the ECB's budget for 2000, which gives the ECB the green light to recruit further staff needed to support the ongoing activities of the ECB. This will bring the ECB's staff to slightly over 1000; the number of staff employed to date stands at 750. At its meeting on 18 November 1999 the Governing Council approved the publication of an update of the book on ""European Union balance of payments statistical methods"" (the ""B.o.p. Book""). This important book documents the statistical methodologies applied in Member States in compiling balance of payments statistics and, as such, improves the transparency of the compilation of euro area statistics. This new version includes additional chapters on: (i) investment income; (ii) estimation methods, especially for goods, investment income and portfolio investment; (iii) financial derivatives; and (iv) the stocks compiled for international investment position statistics. The book was published on the ECB's Web site at 4 p.m. yesterday and will be available from the ECB in hard copy format during the course of next week. Finally, let me inform you that the General Council discussed the monetary policy objectives, strategies and intentions of the non-participating EU central banks against the background set by the monetary policy of the Eurosystem. This is the second time that such an exercise has been undertaken since the ECB was established. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. We did discuss this internally in the ECB, as it should be, before coming to our proposal and we decided to stick to our original decision of basing our strategy - at least one pillar - on a comparison with a reference value, and not a corridor. This was not discussed. Yes, I think so - to continue to pursue a policy that is oriented to price stability in the euro area, and with success, I might say. We do believe - if we get that message across and we will continue to do so - that that in itself will underline, as I have already said, our feeling that the euro has a strong potential to appreciate. On potential growth, if I remember what I said and was reported correctly, I did not say that the potential growth was higher, but that it could be higher and could become higher than the trend rate of growth which we observe, which we put at the figure of 2% to 2½% for the euro area as a whole. If indeed the structural reforms in the labour market, in the good markets, were finally to be implemented throughout the euro area, then we could have a potential growth rate, or a growth rate, that is significantly higher than that currently perceived. But I did not say that it has already happened. The second question on approaching parity was not discussed very thoroughly. As you may know, we do not have an exchange rate target. On the one hand, the exchange rate is regarded as the outcome of the entire economic process and - may I add - the psychological process on both sides of the Atlantic. We are still faced with the phenomenon that we have a remarkable, continued high rate of growth in the United States and only a just recovering but accelerating rate of growth in Europe. That phenomenon, by itself, is what makes the exchange rate movements - let me call it - not inexplicable. Moreover, these movements, as I said earlier, underline our strong belief, as the rates of growth converge on each other, that the euro has a strong potential to appreciate. And the forecasts we have available - also the Commission forecast published last week - say that in two years time the rate of growth in Europe is expected to exceed the rate of growth in the United States. Question (translation): On the exchange rate, the euro/dollar exchange rate: one has the impression that, whatever you say, whatever you do, the euro has continued to slide against the dollar. So, is it a problem of communication, is it the markets who have a problem vis-à-vis the euro? The second question is: this depreciation of the euro against the dollar - is it not a piece of good news? Because some people seem to be thinking that it is a disaster. Could it not be said that it is very positive for the European economy and can it not contribute to the recovery of economic growth in the euro area? Well, you correctly said that - whatever I say or whatever I do - the euro continues its movement. So, I am perhaps best advised to stop saying anything, although, for once, you have not exaggerated. The movements that the exchange rate has shown over the past six months have a two-sided effect. On the one hand, they have increased the import price level in the euro area. So, that has an upward impact, albeit a small one, on future inflation rates. On the other hand, it is undeniable that it makes it easier for our exporters to compete in world markets. What might the motives be? I am an economist and not a psychologist. Well, let me say what I say ever more often: as a central banker, the one thing I have learnt is not to speculate on anything, but rather to fight speculation wherever I can. So, I will refrain from any speculation - also on this aspect. We do not yet see signs of a slowing down, although we expect it over time - but the lags are long, as you know - to do so as a result of our increase in interest rates last month. That might - but it will take time for it to materialise - lead to a smaller growth of M3 in the future. The decision to leave the reference value unchanged was based on the consideration that the factors underlying this decision, the 4½% figure, have remained unchanged. So they did not give any reason - and I will explain it in a minute - to change the overall figure. As you know, the 4½% figure for the reference value is based on our measure of what price stability is. We define price stability as an increase of 2%, or less, in consumer prices. Then it is based on the trend rate of economic growth as we perceive it, which - as I have just said - we still estimate at between 2% and 2½%, and - as a minor factor - on the trend rate of change in the velocity of circulation of money, which is still estimated at between ½% and 1% per year. Well, adding all these figures up, you again, like last year, arrive at a total of around 4½%. Now, what I added today is that if - indeed, also in response to the first question - if potential growth were to rise in the course of time, and if there were convincing evidence that this was happening as a result of structural reforms in the functioning of the various markets, if the potential rate of growth were thus to go higher, then that would also be a reason to reconsider our reference value. But, it is too early to tell whether or not that will materialise. It was what we regard as a highly successful conference. It was attended by all central banks and, in 11 out of 12 cases, by the Governors of the central banks of the accession countries, both the countries that are actually already negotiating and countries that are on the verge of starting negotiations. But it did not only cover co-operation on monetary policy. It covered a broad range of areas in order to make these central banks familiar with concepts, such as the legal framework required for not only the central banks, but also the banking system and the financial markets, with the necessity to change - on accession - the legislation and infrastructure in their countries, with the thought that accession would have implications for their currency regimes, which are now very diverse in the various countries. I would judge it to have been a very successful conference which will form the basis for increased and intensified bilateral contacts, as well as for more specialised multilateral contacts in the various areas of central banking, let me call it that way. And the next such conference, an all-encompassing conference, will take place next year in Vienna, again under the sponsorship of the European Central Bank and, in that case, the National Bank of Austria. The exchange rate - and I can apparently not repeat it often enough - is one of the main indicators forming part of the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy. So it will be watched closely. By itself, it will not trigger a monetary policy reaction. A monetary policy reaction will always be based on an analysis of the two pillars of the strategy. And whether or not I am concerned is not so relevant. I would become concerned if our strong belief - the potential for an appreciation of the euro, the future strength of the euro - were not to materialise over time. But these things always take time. Question (translation): Mr. President, I have a question on the review of the reference value for M3 in the event of a stronger growth potential. The stronger growth potential in the case of productivity advances would clearly also mean that the upward movement of prices is not developing as had initially been expected - viz. the United States. This means that a higher growth potential does not necessarily demand an increase in the reference value for M3. My second question: you have given the forecast or anticipated growth rate as 3% in the forthcoming year and in the year after that, or as just under 3%, and the rate of inflation as below 2%. Is this a first attempt at publishing ECB forecasts? The first question, I did not understand. As to the second question: indeed, when we make judgements about the forecasts of others, we also - for the time being, internally - compare them with those of the European Commission, the OECD, the IMF and our regular survey of forecasting institutions. We, of course, also compare those forecasts with our internal preliminary forecasts, which will ultimately be published in the course of next year, as I have often announced. But what is striking so far is that all the forecasts I have mentioned, both the external and the internal, are strikingly similar in their outcome. So, for example, the forecasts that were published by the European Commission, although the underlying assumptions were sometimes slightly different from ours, their outcome was virtually identical. So, I would point out that the European Commission also forecasts average inflation in 2000 and 2001 to be 1.5%, and we see no reason to deviate from that forecast. Would you excuse me that I will not join in the speculation on interest rates for the future? So, I will not give a judgement on that. Given the fact that our monetary analysis and our monetary policy stance allows for an expected price development of less than 2% over the next two years, i.e. over the medium-term, I do not share your hypothesis that our monetary policy would be far too accommodative. It would only be so if price developments would happen to exceed our limit of 2% in the medium run. All I want to say about the recent intervention in Germany - in the company market, may we call it like that - is that it does not enhance the image which we want to have of being an increasingly market-driven economy across the euro area. On the first one, I can be very quick. Our expectation is - as announced - that we will have the next review of the reference value for M3 in December 2000. Not ""definitely"", but ""not likely"". Our studies, as published in a Working Paper two months ago, already indicate that we perceive a very stable relationship in the money demand function, in the relationship between M3 and prices over the medium term. And the figures, as our statisticians have assured us, are becoming more reliable almost by the day. But we do, of course, have this Y2K effect which may cause some hickups in the development of the figures. On interventions: all I can say is that, as you know, we have the instrument available. As to whenever and wherever and how we are going to use it, I will not speculate. No, but I was only referring to the fall-out, to what impression of the European economy these actions have given and give, I think. And, whatever I may say to the German Government, I would rather say to the German Government directly. "
04/11/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The outcome of today's meeting was that the Governing Council has decided to increase the ECB interest rates. The forthcoming main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as fixed rate tenders at an interest rate of 3.0%, starting with the operation to be settled on 10 November 1999. This increase implies an upward adjustment of 50 basis points from the rate of 2.5% applied to previous such operations. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be increased from 3.5% to 4.0% and that on the deposit facility from 1.5% to 2.0%, both with effect from 5 November 1999. Overall, on the basis of prospective developments, the Governing Council considers that today's decision will counter the upward trend of the balance of risks to price stability. This decision will therefore contribute to sustaining non-inflationary economic growth in the euro area over the medium term. The main argument for raising the interest rates was the fact that since around the beginning of the summer the balance of risks to future price stability has gradually been moving towards the upside. In fact, the economic situation in spring 1999 had given rise to concern about downward risks and had led to a precautionary interest rate reduction by 50 basis points on 8 April 1999. However, the current economic environment is far more favourable. Moreover, several indicators, including monetary growth, suggest that there is ample liquidity in the euro area. Inflation rates are expected to increase gradually in the months ahead, mainly as a result of the increase in energy prices earlier this year working its way through to consumer prices. The latest data on industrial producer prices confirm this pattern. Over the medium term, however, it is important to prevent the availability of ample liquidity from translating into upward pressure on prices. In particular, an increase in interest rates now should help to counteract further liquidity growth over the medium term and contribute to maintaining inflation expectations safely below 2%. With regard to the perception that an increase in interest rates now would endanger the resumption of economic growth, the Governing Council is of the opposite opinion. A timely rise in interest rates will avoid the need for a larger increase in interest rates later and, hence, will contribute to stronger growth over an extended period of time. Concerning the size of an increase in interest rates, against the background of a fundamentally changed situation, the precautionary interest rate reduction made in April 1999 is no longer justified. Furthermore, today's move by 50 basis points appeared to be the best way in which to avoid uncertainties regarding the future course of monetary policy. In addition, such a move is expected to contribute to reducing any uncertainty premia potentially prevalent in financial markets and also to help to contain a possible increase in volatility in money markets towards the end of the year. Under these circumstances, the alternative of moving by less than 50 basis points now and examining the need for an additional step later on could potentially introduce unwarranted uncertainty for the period ahead. Let me now provide you with more detailed information on monetary, financial and other economic developments, and thereby further explain the decisions taken today. With regard to monetary developments in the euro area, the monetary data up to September 1999 reinforced the view that M3 growth is on a rising trend. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from July to September 1999, was 5.9%, which is almost 1½ percentage points above the reference value of 4½%. This deviation from the reference value has steadily increased during 1999. The strong growth of the most liquid components of M3 is particularly noteworthy, suggesting that the very low level of interest rates favoured the strong growth of monetary aggregates. The pick-up in economic activity is likely to have further stimulated M3 growth. Credit to the private sector also continued to expand rapidly in September 1999, at a rate in excess of 10%. The demand for loans remained strong throughout the first three quarters of 1999, supported in particular by the low level of bank lending rates and the ongoing economic recovery. Overall, these developments indicate a generous liquidity situation in the euro area. Euro area financial market developments over the past few months confirm the general change in economic conditions and perspectives for the euro area by also anticipating an acceleration of economic growth. This is reflected in the rise in government bond yields and the associated pronounced steepening of the yield curve since spring 1999. Today's decision should contribute to firming financial market expectations of stronger growth without increasing inflationary pressures. With regard to economic activity itself, current information indeed continues to support the view that there is an ongoing strengthening in the euro area. The outlook for the world economy remains positive; this mainly relates to the sustained growth of the US economy, but also to the apparent strengthening of the recoveries in South-East Asia and Japan. Most recent data releases for the euro area suggest an acceleration of real GDP growth rates in the second half of this year. This is indicated by confidence and survey data, as well as by production data for the industrial sector extending into the third quarter of the year. Therefore, the prospects for a continued improvement in output growth remain good. Concerning consumer prices, in September 1999 the annual rate of change in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was 1.2%, that is to say unchanged from August 1999. On the one hand, upward pressures related to the surge in oil prices in recent months and to the rate of change in prices for seasonal food. On the other hand, in September the increases in both services prices and prices for non-energy industrial goods were more moderate than in August. Countervailing price movements of such a kind may possibly continue in the coming months, while expectations remain that there will be some overall upward movement in the HICP rate in the short term, which will mainly be linked to energy prices. In conclusion, the downside risks to price stability have disappeared. Instead, monetary developments, together with the accumulating evidence of improved economic prospects, confirmed the view expressed earlier by the Governing Council that the balance of risks to future price stability has gradually moved towards the upside. This assessment argued in favour of adjusting the interest rates within the context of a monetary policy stance which is conducive to maintaining price stability over the medium term. Containing inflationary expectations in a forward-looking manner is decisive for ensuring sustainable growth in GDP and employment. This would be greatly facilitated if individual member countries were to make convincing progress in the structural reform of the labour and product markets, which, over the medium term, would enhance the euro area's production potential and thereby curb upward pressure on prices as the recovery proceeds. Together with fiscal consolidation in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact and the necessary moderate wage developments, such reforms could make a crucial contribution towards transforming the current cyclical upswing into a process of longer-term non-inflationary growth. In a press release dated 1 July 1999, the ECB indicated that an announcement would be made in November with regard to the decision on the public relations agency selected to prepare and execute a Europe-wide information campaign for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002. In this regard, I am now pleased to announce that the Governing Council has decided to negotiate the contract with Publicis. Further information on this matter can be found in a separate press release which will be issued this afternoon. Finally, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the second meeting of the Governing Council to be held in December has been rescheduled. As announced yesterday, the meeting has been brought forward from Thursday, 16 December 1999, to Wednesday, 15 December 1999, in order to enable several Governing Council members to attend a first gathering of a new forum consisting of ministers of finance and central bank governors (the so-called ""G20""), which is to be held in Berlin on 16 December 1999. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Yes and no. No, I can't say that. We don't precisely know what level would be the neutral rate. That is a well-known topic. We don't precisely know what it is. What we were sure of is that, whatever the so-called neutral or balanced rate might be, the level of 2.5% prevailing until today was below it. So we can say that this move of today is a move in the direction of the so-called neutral rate, even though we do not know where the neutral rate precisely finds itself. There was not a single final piece of evidence. We have received a lot of new evidence in the course of this month and not only, as some think, on M3 growth, but also on producer prices across the euro area which are an indication of future price developments in the consumer sphere. We have received evidence - as I have mentioned - on confidence surveys of both consumers and investors and of course a lot of anecdotal evidence coming from the various countries. So it was a host of evidence, but evidence all pointing in the same direction. I don't know. The surprise in April was a surprise not so much about the fact of moving, but about the size. The fact that we were moving in April was already widely discounted in the markets. The size may have been a surprise. And I would like to repeat that it is not our policy to catch markets by surprise. We do want to be predictable. We do want to be credible which doesn't rule out that, on some occasion in the future, we may be forced to surprise markets. That can then even be a part of policy. On the other hand, it is not our policy to do so. So what you can expect, that was your question, will there be a continued policy of going the other mile, as you put it, I would say: No, but then I don't know. I didn't mention it specifically, but, in assessing all the indicators we had, we paid due attention to the fact that in various regions of euro area there seems to be an acceleration in wage demands which, by itself, is adding to our conviction that it is about time to raise interest rates. By no means. We think that creating an environment of stable prices - and that is what this interest rate move is contributing to - is the best support that monetary policy can give to economic growth and growth of employment - wherever, in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands or Ireland. The level of interest rates at which we are means - to restate what I said previously - interest rates at a historically low level and certainly below a level which can be regarded as more or less neutral in an environment of sustained economic growth. We certainly think that, rather than inhibiting growth, this will help growth. The stability-oriented environment in itself is a great support for a gradual real recovery in all areas of the euro area. You can't understand anything because - let me phrase it this way - in our deliberations we were very sure that, had we moved by 25 basis points, we would immediately have created the expectation and speculation in the markets that there would be another step to follow. That is precisely a phenomenon which we did not want. We want to calm down markets and market expectations without saying anything about whether and when a next step might be necessary. Looking at the facts, you certainly can interpret it that way and I mean - in April we had lowered interest rates, in December, already last year, we had, in a co-ordinated way, lowered interest rates - now we are raising them. So there is a reversal of measures because there is a reversal in economic conditions and indicators which we perceived. No, I cannot. No. What I said is that we have come to the conclusion that there is ample liquidity, I could add, very ample liquidity available in the euro area economy. What we want to do is to prevent the liquidity situation from becoming so ample that over time - and the lags are very long, as you know, in monetary policy and monetary analysis - that over time this ample availability of liquidity would by itself exert an upward pressure on prices. And that is all I have said and that is what I must insist on continuing to say. Today's decision was a decision taken by consensus. Is that enough? It does. Not by copying the United States. If we were able to quickly enforce the so badly needed structural changes, as I said, in labour markets, in goods markets, in all kinds of activity in the economic sphere, then we could come to a higher potential growth rate than we are actually seeing now. But that is the first thing that is necessary. In other words, what is so much talked about, namely whether or not the United States has entered into a so-called new economy, I don't think that that moment has yet arrived at all in Europe. We first have to get our own house, and that is our labour house, our product market house, in order before we can start thinking about phenomena which are so benevolent in the United States. The forecasts by all institutions that we have available, including our own internal forecasts, in as far as we have them, point to an inflation rate which, on average, in the year 2000 - on average, I say - will remain safely below 2%. However, all indicators, as we assessed them today, - and I am talking about wage demands, I am talking about producer prices, and I am talking about the liquidity situation - point in a direction that the risks on the upside are increasing and have already increased, i.e. the risk of that figure of 1½% to 1½% being threatened. And it is precisely for that reason - since we want to keep inflation over the medium term well below the 2% figure that we have set for ourselves as being compatible with price stability - it is precisely for that reason that we have taken the decision of today. Question (translation): Mr. President, can you say whether today's decision was taken primarily with a view backwards or forwards? Have you found that the rate cut of April was too marked, so that monetary expansion was encouraged, or - if we look forwards and say that the rate of inflation will remain below 2% in the year 2000 - that the decision was, so to speak, the return to a monetary policy strategy? Only in that case can the interest rate decision be understood both in principle and in economic terms. Duisenberg:We remain forward-looking. That is our duty. That is also the basis for the decisions taken today. And we have considered this decision in the light of the two broad pillars in our monetary policy strategy, i.e. both from the angle of monetary developments and from the assessment of a very wide range of indicators for the future, in as far as we had them available. So, it is by no means a change in strategy, nor a change in tactics that underlies our decision. It was not an issue, but it was one of the factors taken into consideration - co-determining, if I may put it that way, the size of the rate increase. It was no issue at all. In some countries, I believe four, current inflation rates are over 2%. That is in Ireland, Portugal, the Netherlands, and Spain. However, current inflation rates are not a determinant of our decisions on interest rates at any time. We have a forward-looking strategy and we stick to that. I would also like to repeat, once again, that the inflation differentials, as they exist today in the euro area, are by no means exceptional, or anything special. For that, I would like to refer to the article in our last Monthly Bulletin which explicitly analysed this phenomenon and which also came to the conclusion that the regional differentials in inflation rates in Europe, as they are today, are even smaller than they are - also today - in that other big monetary area, the United States. Even if it was just an impression, I do not think it will undermine the setting of monetary policy. It is very difficult to prevent market expectations from developing in the way as they have done over the past two or three weeks. That is admittedly true. But we deliberately changed the tone of our assessment and of its presentation, starting on 15 July in a press conference, with all of you present. We did that deliberately on 15 July and we have continued to stick to those indications throughout the period up to the present. It sometimes happens in practice that in the repetition it may seem as if there is an acceleration, which was not our intention, but you cannot do anything about that. But then I want to repeat - we do want to be predictable, to the maximum extent possible, because only in this way can we also succeed in being credible on the markets. Next week Friday we have a seminar for the accession countries in Helsinki, organised by the ECB in co-operation with the central banks of Finland and Austria. And all governors of the accession countries - with the exception of one, I believe - will come to that seminar and we will discuss a wide range of issues which have to do with legal aspects, statistical aspects, monetary policy aspects of entry to or becoming a member of the EU. And, in this case, because the negotiations that are going on with these countries will not result in any country having the so-called opt-out clause, as the United Kingdom and Denmark had when they were already members, accession to the EU inevitably means that over time there will also have to be accession to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. And, maybe later, it also means that it will end in the adoption of the euro as a currency for these countries. But, for all these aspects, we will have this seminar to exchange information and to increase our visibility and transparency vis-à-vis our colleagues at the central banks in those countries. By the way, there will be a press conference after the seminar in Helsinki. Your hypothetical question relating to countries which want unilaterally to adopt the euro as their currency, be it in the form of a currency board or ""euro-isation"" of the country: we will watch closely whether that would have any monetary policy complications or implications for the euro area. If so, we would certainly get in touch with the countries concerned to consider whether and how they should take such a move. But, so far, the countries that have indicated that they are thinking of moving in that direction seem not to be an overwhelmingly disturbing factor for the euro area as a whole, let me put it this way. Question (translation): My question is addressed to Christian Noyer: Since we have just had Halloween, do you have the impression that public opinion will think that central bankers have seen a ghost - a ghost which only they can see - which is the return - still a long way off, if I have understood properly, of course - of inflation? How can you convey a clear message to the public without using the dread term ""M3""? Noyer: Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm only going to repeat what the President has already said. First, we've been trying - since 15 July actually - to explain to the public in advance that our assessments of past or current developments in all the indicators available to us - or which we said right from the start were the reference points of our strategy - be they monetary indicators for the first pillar or indicators both of the real economy and the financial economy for the second pillar - were showing a very clear development. We have tried to explain in advance to the public that it would not be our desire to put a stop to growth at the very moment it was beginning to pick up, but to make sure that this growth could remain non-inflationary and hence would have the best chance of lasting a long time. And that's our aim: that growth should pick up in Europe - growth is at different stages in different regions, but almost everywhere it is picking up - and at a favourable pace which does not generate inflationary tensions, because if that were to happen we should be obliged to take measures to curb it later on. We want instead that growth should be sound, without inflationary tensions so that it will last as long as possible and be as strong as possible. In other words, today's movement in interest rates is the ECB's contribution to the maintenance and the development of growth which is strong and lasting because it is non-inflationary. This being said, this is not the only condition for growth to remain strong over the long term and to have a powerful employment creation effect. Just as a last word: if I may repeat our leitmotiv, because in our view it is absolutely crucial: provided a number of structural reforms are carried out or pursued in Europe, inter alia in terms of goods, services and labour markets, Europe's growth potential will be maximised and the employment benefits of growth will also be maximised. So that if we want to see unemployment continue to fall - even fall faster - in Europe, we believe we are contributing to this end by our decision today, which supports long-term strong growth which avoids the danger of inflationary developments - although this is not a substitute for the carrying-out or pursuit of structural reforms. Well, that last conclusion I would not share with you. What I simply said in the past and what I said today is that we needed more evidence and we now can conclude that month after month after month the monetary aggregates have been moving further away from what we have called our reference value. That can vary from one month to another, of course. But you need an adequately long period in which you can come to that conclusion. Then, at the same time, we are not looking only at the monetary aggregates. No, we have deliberately adopted a two-pillar strategy in which we look at a broad range of other indicators - and I have mentioned quite a few to you today - which also determines our attitude, together with the assessment of monetary developments. To my mind, we were and we are very predictable. The major difference between, let us say, the underlying situation in April and that of today was that in April we had two pillars, so to speak, pointing in different directions, which made the situation more difficult to both interpret and to act upon. Today, we have both pillars suddenly pointing in the same direction, namely in the direction of an increased risk towards price stability as we perceive it. That is very difficult to describe. It is a process. It is not just one decision, or at one moment, that you come to such a conclusion - certainly not, as we did today, collectively. But every individual member of the Council has over the past few weeks, some even over the past few months, been busy with himself and others thinking about how do we interpret the current developments. And then, finally, we come together on a day like this. But it has been prepared very well in small circles. Of course, we in the Executive Board have also discussed it earlier this week and we all came to our individual assessments. And then, finally, you come together on a morning like today and you confront each other with your thoughts and the outcome of your thinking over the past period and then it finally comes out that this is the decision we want to take on the proposal one of us had made. "
07/10/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was attended by the European Commissioner, Mr. Solbes Mira. The outcome of today's discussion was that the Governing Council has decided to leave the prevailing ECB interest rates unchanged. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will thus remain 2.5%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 3.5% and that on the deposit facility has been kept at 1.5%. The Governing Council conducted an intensive discussion of the current monetary policy stance in which it was concluded that the balance of risks to price stability remains on an upward trend. With regard to monetary developments in the euro area, the three-month average of the 12-month growth rates of M3 for the period June to August 1999 increased to 5.6%, from 5.5% in the three-month period ending in July 1999. While a good deal of caution is required when interpreting short-term monetary developments, it should be noted that the 12-month growth rate of M3 has displayed an upward trend during 1999. The high growth of M3 seems to be related to the low level of opportunity costs of holding monetary assets, particularly the most liquid components. Furthermore, the gradual improvement in the real economic situation may have fostered the expansion of M3. Credit to the private sector also continued to expand at a fast rate in August 1999, namely 10.7%. Since the start of Stage Three credit to the private sector has been expanding at rates of around 10%. Developments in credit growth in August tend to confirm that the demand for loans remains strong, supported by low bank lending rates, indicating that euro area residents do not face borrowing constraints. On balance, the Governing Council believes that monetary conditions, especially the sustained growth of M3 in excess of the reference value, signal a rather generous liquidity situation in the euro area. Long-term nominal interest rates in the euro area continued to increase in September. While it is likely that this increase is related to expectations of a recovery of activity in the euro area, expectations of increasing inflationary pressure may also play a role. The more favourable expectations for economic development in the euro area are partly connected with a further improved outlook for the world economy, as is also reflected in the recent upward revision of the forecast for world growth by the IMF. The growth of the US economy continues to be strong, and in Japan economic indicators are now more clearly pointing towards an improvement in economic activity. In addition, in some Asian countries the recovery in growth appears to be taking place somewhat earlier than expected. Notwithstanding individual downside risks in the countries I have just mentioned and a more general uncertainty regarding the recovery in Latin America, the world economy seems to be set for higher growth. As regards economic activity in the euro area, some important data have been released since we last met. A first estimate by Eurostat for real GDP growth in the second quarter of 1999 points to slightly lower quarter-on-quarter growth compared with the first quarter of this year. However, these data do not appear to impinge on the view that there is an upturn in growth in the course of this year. In fact, industrial production data for the period up to July confirm the gradual improvement of recent months, and various survey data suggest that there was a further strengthening of output growth in the industrial sector over the summer months. Evidence for the consumer sector continues to point to broadly robust consumption growth. The outlook for a continuing improvement in overall activity therefore remains favourable. In line with our expectations, the annual rate of change in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) saw a further rise in August 1999 to 1.2%, up from 1.1% a month earlier. This upward movement was mainly caused by the ongoing increase in oil prices. Some counterweight came from a decline in unprocessed food prices and from a lower rate of increase in services prices. Largely reflecting this development in services prices, the HICP rate excluding more volatile components - namely energy and seasonal food - declined to 0.9% in August, having risen to 1.0% in July. Oil prices continued to increase further in September and, given the relatively short time of pass-through to consumer prices, expectations of further increases in the overall HICP rate in the coming months have become firmer. In conclusion, monetary and credit developments indicate that continuous close attention must be given to upward risks to price stability. In the light of the medium-term orientation of the Eurosystem's monetary policy, the rising trend of M3 growth calls for great vigilance on the part of monetary policy. The recent increase in oil prices will continue to impose additional upward pressure on the HICP. Seen in isolation, the increase in energy prices should have only a temporary effect upon consumer price increases, but it is essential that this effect does not trigger wage claims which prove incompatible with price stability in the medium term. Against the background of the medium-term outlook for a sustained acceleration in economic activity, decisive structural reform is warranted in order to prevent early upward pressure on prices. In fact, the Governing Council sees a strong case for enhancing structural reform in labour and product markets. The anticipation of an expected cyclical improvement should not lead to a weakening of efforts in this regard, but rather it should be used as a welcome opportunity to make convincing progress. This, together with continued wage moderation and fiscal adjustment in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, would greatly facilitate the monetary policy task of maintaining price stability in an environment of stronger growth. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to introduce three additional topics which we discussed during our meeting: In addition to reviewing the main monetary, financial and other economic indicators, the Governing Council formally adopted the Decision of the ECB on fraud prevention, according to which an independent Anti-Fraud Committee will be established to enforce an anti-fraud scheme within the ECB. The Committee will be composed of three independent persons of recognised standing and professional experience in the fields of central banking, justice and policing. Within the ECB, the Directorate Internal Audit is entrusted with the task of conducting all investigations relating to fraud prevention and detection. For the purpose of combating fraud, the Director of Internal Audit will report to the Anti-Fraud Committee. A co-operative relationship will be established with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). As I already emphasised at the last press conference, the ECB shares the concerns of the European Parliament, the EU Council and the European Commission about the need to combat fraud and other activities detrimental to the financial interests of the Communities and the ECB. You will find further information relating to this Decision in the separate press release which has been issued today. I should also like to mention that the Governing Council had a preliminary discussion on EU accession countries. The accession of new members to the European Union is an area of development in which the Eurosystem will be increasingly involved. As you are well aware, 12 countries are official candidates for membership and negotiations have already started with a ""first wave"" of six countries. The negotiations with these countries are intensifying and the chapters on Economic and Monetary Union and on Free Movement of Capital have been opened this autumn. Against this background, the Governing Council has already considered a number of issues related to EU enlargement in areas of relevance to the Eurosystem. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided to organise a high-level seminar between the Eurosystem and the central banks of the 12 accession countries to be held in Helsinki on 10-12 November 1999. Following a number of bilateral contacts which the ECB has already had this year, the meeting in Helsinki will be attended by the governors of the central banks of the accession countries. It will provide the opportunity to strengthen the working relationships between the Eurosystem and the central banks of accession countries and to deepen the dialogue between the two sides. Finally, the Governing Council approved 21 additional links established between securities settlement systems which can be used for the transfer of foreign collateral in the Eurosystem's monetary policy and intraday credit operations. With the approval of these links, the number of links which are currently eligible to be used by the Eurosystem increased from 26 to 47. You will find further information relating to this decision in the separate press release which has been issued today. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, on your comments: now, if you are looking at the two pillars of your strategy, then you have strengthened expectations of a further tightening of interest rates, or is that wrong? Because you are looking at the money supply and you are saying that there are no further distortions than there were at the beginning of the year. There is also further pressure from prices and the economy is looking as if it is going better. Now, looking at what Vice President Noyer said at the Parliament and what was said in New York, is it true to think that there is a tightening bias, which is actually going to lead to a tightening in the near future? We are of the opinion, as we found today, that we have already sensed in the euro area, effectively for more than a year, a rather accommodative stance of monetary policy. And we did come to the conclusion that it has served its purpose. It has contributed to a resumption of growth in a climate of price stability. So now, we are indeed assessing whether this period of an accommodative monetary policy stance has lasted long enough. But what we do need is some more evidence to make our conclusions very firm, which will lead us to further action. The discussion in the Governing Council was indeed very intense, very thorough, but not at all controversial. And we reached the conclusions, as I just read them to you, in great harmony. Now, as far as the pre-emptive nature of any strikes - if any - are concerned, I do want to emphasise, again, that it is not the inclination of the ECB to play a very activist role in trying to fine-tune the economy. On the other hand, any measures taken, whenever they are taken, will always have to be and will be timely. Well, it was not discussed as such at today's meeting. But what we do consider is that this deregulation, liberalisation and increasing competition in itself might be a process which is rather long-term in character - because it is ongoing. Let me repeat the words I used earlier. The discussion was very intense and was conducted, and ended, in great harmony. . it keeps on creeping. I am not good at measuring velocities, but - it is still there. What we were trying to communicate was that we wanted to maintain the tone that we had set in the press conference on 15 July. Well, we need not only a closer look, but also more data on the developments which I described earlier. On monetary developments, growth of M3, we will have new data by the end of this month, as well as new data on actual price developments and the entire broad range of indicators we look at. So, let me say this, the bias we discussed earlier is still there in full force. But before taking action we need more conclusive evidence confirming our preliminary assessment. Those that I read in the Introductory Statement. I am not going to disclose the individual members' behaviour. I am going to repeat that the discussion was conducted, and ended, in great harmony. We do not use the word ""bias"". That was put into our mouths by someone else. But we did not deny that the tendency was there. Neither do we deny that now. What we mean with what you call ""bias"": I hope that I have clearly described that we have seen monetary developments - already for nine months now - as going in the same direction. We see a slow, although not unexpected, increase in the rate of inflation. At the same time, we see the resumption of growth occurring in the euro area. We see ourselves confirmed in our expectation that this acceleration of growth will continue into the next year and throughout the next year. At the same time, we conclude that, as I said earlier, we have now already had a truly accommodative monetary policy stance over, effectively, more than a year. And we are now turning our mind in our medium-term outlook to the future, realising that we have to adopt and to have a monetary policy stance which is conducive to sustainable non-inflationary growth, which is somewhat different from the accommodative stance we had in a period when we saw output slowing and inflationary expectations or tendencies even going in a downward direction. I can't say when - I can say, of course: ""when the time is right"". That would be the right time. But what we do see - as far as inflation is concerned, insofar as we pay attention to current developments - is that inflation is slowly creeping up, but - and not unexpectedly - due almost exclusively to the increase in oil prices which is working its way through into consumer prices and which will presumably continue to work its way through. At the same time, our expectation is that this will continue for a few months, but that it will then flatten out. But we also see signs that it might accelerate somewhat further, but we need further evidence to confirm this. And especially - what I warned against - if a fear, which is there, were to become true that the current rate of increase in inflation would spill over into second-round effects, if we were to see signs of that, that would increase our anxiety, to say the least. We do see that the Y2K phenomenon has some impact on future interest rates, we see that as a once-and-for-all impact. As to the problem of Y2K as such, we think and we have published that we have it well under control. Especially in the payment systems area, we have - as you know - conducted extensive tests together with hundreds of private sector financial institutions which have, on the whole, proven that the financial sector, including the central banks, is well prepared for the changeover to the new millenium. The answer to the second question is ""no"". The answer to the first question is somewhat more complicated. You have to realise that the statement by the fifteen participating central banks implied that they would limit their annual sales of gold to an amount of approximately 400 tonnes per year and to an amount not exceeding 2,000 tonnes over the next five years. There are many plans, decided or planned by some central banks. But the statement was intended to give some certainty, or to take away uncertainty - let me put it that way - in the gold market for five years and then we will review it. And we will probably review it sometime ahead of the end of the five-year period. As far as your question on compensation is concerned, I would say that that is not on the agenda, given the fact that we know precisely what the UK Government intends to do, which are sales far below the 400 tonnes per year, and they have announced the amounts and the time schedule precisely. We know, preliminarily, what the Swiss authorities intend to do, but I would like to emphasise that the Swiss have never announced either when they would start or when they would end. So there is no time schedule there. Well, we do not know that yet. If there are any distortions, we would only be able to draw conclusions from them after they are known. I am not afraid of them, no. In today's decision? To no extent - neither large nor small. Well, the exchange rate has behaved, let me say, quite normally over the past, let's say, four weeks, since we last met here. It has gradually strengthened somewhat, to a level - as it was this morning at 1 o'clock - of about USD 1.0710. Then we announced our interest rate decisions and the exchange rate dropped to USD 1.0660 within five minutes and ten minutes later it was back at USD 1.0710. So, on the whole, the movement has not given rise to any unrest or concern. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg - actually, the question is also addressed to Mr. Noyer - do you really feel in your speeches that the general public actually gets to hear what you want to say or do you rather feel that some of your statements are interpreted to an excessive degree? Duisenberg (to Mr. Noyer): Do you or do I have to answer that question? Noyer: You could do that. But I can simply say that what I have said was exactly along the lines that have been developed in this room in July and September, and nothing more. Perhaps you want to add something because you have also been quoted. I have seen that your remarks, Christian, which you made in French, seemed suddenly through the translation to adopt quite another meaning and that was a phenomenon which we have to deal with and to cope with. But there it was purely translation which gave another interpretation to the remarks than that given in the original language. Very specifically, in the English translation in the Parliament the translators used the word ""probable"" in a certain context, whereas the word ""probable"" did not appear in the French text. In the translation it was stronger, yes. But the problem - if I answer this question - is that I have to answer it every time, which I do not want to do, but - for this time - I will make an exception. There was no vote. Question (translation): Please, Mr. President, your interpretation of the interpretation of your statements makes me raise the question as to whether you would put things as your colleague, Mr. Greenspan, always does: ""Congressman, if you got this right, then I've done something wrong?"" I hope not. I hope that I will always be perfectly transparent, clear and predictable. So I hope to be understood well. "
09/09/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB, which were attended by Mr. de Silguy, European Commissioner. The Governing Council reviewed the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area, in line with its monetary policy strategy. As a result, the Governing Council decided not to change the prevailing ECB interest rates. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will thus remain 2.5%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 3.5% and that on the deposit facility has been kept at 1.5%. Let me give you some details about our review of the latest information on monetary, financial and other economic developments, as well as about our latest assessment of the monetary policy stance and thereby explain the decisions taken today. With regard to monetary developments in the euro area, the 12-month growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 increased from 5.3% in June to 5.6% in July 1999. The latest three-month average of M3 growth, covering the period from May to July 1999, rose to 5.4%, compared with 5.3% in the previous three-month period from April to June 1999. Overall, the annual rate of growth of M3 has been moving away from the reference value of 4½% since the start of the year. This upward movement may be explained to a large extent by the very low opportunity costs of holding monetary assets, especially the most liquid components, but perhaps also by the gradually improving economic conditions in the euro area. At the same time, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector remained high, even though it declined by 0.5 percentage point in July, to 10.4%. The monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem assigns a prominent role to the behaviour of M3. Accordingly, recent monetary developments merit close attention. At the same time, taking into account the fact that we are still in a very early phase of Monetary Union and that figures for broad money growth have been subject to some revisions in recent months, shorter-term monetary developments need to be interpreted with caution. Concerning financial market indicators, the upturn in long-term interest rates in the euro area seen since early May continued in August and early September. Domestic factors seem to have played a dominant role, as indicated by the fact that differentials between US and euro area bond yields have narrowed further. In particular, market participants appear to be increasingly optimistic about the prospects for economic activity in the euro area. At the same time, expectations for inflation, as reflected by, inter alia, the signs emanating from index-linked bonds issued in the euro area, tend to indicate that markets still expect an evolution of consumer prices, which will remain compatible with price stability. Developments in the world economy continue to show signs of improvement. Growth in the US economy continues and some positive economic signals have been recorded for Japan. While the outlook for stronger growth in the global economy is also supported by recent developments in other regions, notably South-East Asia, some risks remain, primarily in relation to the strength of the recovery in Latin America. As regards economic activity in the euro area, industrial production data up to June point to a further improvement in output growth in the second quarter of this year, as has already been indicated by various survey data. Moreover, available evidence in terms of retail sales data and consumer confidence, while somewhat more mixed, suggest broadly sustained consumption growth. These developments are consistent with recently published forecasts, which foresee an upturn in economic growth in the course of this year. The downside risks pertaining to these projections have tended to recede and real GDP growth might eventually turn out to be somewhat higher than currently forecast. As generally expected, consumer price increases, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), picked up in July, with the annual rate of change rising from 0.9% in June to 1.1% in July. This effectively reversed the downward movement in the overall HICP rate, which had been evident since April 1999. While prices for unprocessed food declined further in July, this downward effect on the overall HICP rate was more than offset by a stronger increase in energy prices, resulting from a continued rise in oil prices. We expect consumer price increases to rise somewhat further from their July levels, mainly as a consequence of higher oil prices. However, at this stage we also expect this further increase to level out below the ceiling we have defined as being compatible with price stability over the medium term. In conclusion, the prospects for a sustained economic upturn in the euro area are good, as are the chances of continued price stability. However, we remain vigilant taking into account the upward risks to price stability. In particular, with a view to conducting a thorough assessment of the risks to price stability in the medium term, the increase in monetary growth over recent months and the high growth rate of credit to the private sector need to be monitored very carefully. In addition, the short-term upward pressure on consumer prices, which stems from the increase in oil prices over recent months and the lagged pass-through of developments in the exchange rate, have to be taken into account. If accompanied by continued wage moderation, these factors alone should not be expected to threaten the current outlook for price stability. Accordingly, the results of the wage bargaining round for the year 2000 will play a particularly important role for the further assessment of price developments in the euro area. The only way to prolong a non-inflationary recovery, and hence to substantially re-absorb the still very high unemployment, is for all responsible parties to act decisively, in the near term, to increase flexibility in the labour, product and service markets. This would also be the best way to allow the economy to take full advantage from the present stance of monetary policy. Taking all this information into account, the Governing Council decided to maintain the prevailing ECB interest rates. In addition, it stressed that low inflation and therefore low interest rates should encourage higher investment, helping to prevent the emergence of capacity constraints during economic expansion. At the same time, the expected improvement in economic activity offers greater opportunities to cut fiscal deficits further and to enhance structural reforms. Indeed, the creation of this virtuous circle depends on all policy-makers playing their part. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to introduce three additional topics, which we discussed during our meetings. In addition to reviewing the main monetary, financial and other economic indicators, we discussed issues relating to the transition to the Year 2000. We are now approaching the final phase of testing activities in connection with preparatory work for the Century Date Change. On 25 September 1999 the ECB and the EU national central banks will conduct a demonstration of the TARGET Year 2000 compliance in which - according to current information - several hundred EU credit institutions will participate. Prior to this, the ECB and the national central banks have already successfully tested their TARGET components first at the national level, and thereafter in cross-border tests. To a large extent credit institutions have already taken part in these tests. In parallel, as announced a few weeks ago, on 29 June 1999 the ECB together with the national central banks successfully completed the bilateral testing of the ESCB applications that are necessary for the conduct of monetary policy operations. The testing exercise, together with the parallel remedial actions, has proved that these systems are Year 2000 compliant. You may recall that on 15 July 1999 we decided to close TARGET on 31 December 1999, in order to smooth the transition not only for the ESCB institutions, but also for the other financial institutions. This day can thus be kept free for end-of-year operations and for making full back-ups of the relevant systems. In the area of TARGET, as well as in the area of monetary policy implementation and liquidity management, we are also reviewing our contingency procedures to minimise any potential Year 2000-related impact. It is worth noting that general contingency procedures had already been put in place shortly before the launch of the euro. In addition, we will use an efficient communication infrastructure between the ECB and the national central banks to monitor developments over the Year 2000 transition period. The ECB will also share information with the Joint Year 2000 Council and will thereby extend its monitoring capabilities beyond the Eurosystem to a global perspective. As far as our monetary policy framework is concerned, we are convinced that it is flexible enough and has built-in mechanisms designed to deal with any level of liquidity demand that might arise in the euro markets. Indeed, should any adaptation be advisable, this would be of limited importance and consistent with the overall set-up. We have analysed different scenarios and have come to the conclusion that the Eurosystem will be in a position to cope with any potential increase in the demand for liquidity. The stock of banknotes held by national central banks is sufficient to allow for a considerable additional demand for banknotes in circulation and the amount of collateral available in the Eurosystem will be sufficient to allow for the corresponding increase in refinancing needs of the banking system. We are therefore confident that the Eurosystem will continue its operations smoothly on 3 January 2000 after the Century Date Change. We also reviewed cross-border retail payment services, which are essential for the smooth functioning of the Single Market. We believe that citizens and businesses can only benefit fully from the fundamental principles of the free movement of goods, services, capital and people if they are also able to transfer money as rapidly, reliably and cheaply from one part of the European Union to another, as is now the case within each Member State. Despite the introduction of the euro, however, there is still a clear gap between the service levels of domestic and cross-border retail payment systems in terms of quality, efficiency and pricing. The substantial disparities between domestic and cross-border services ought now to be reduced, and should ultimately disappear. In order to encourage the development of cross-border payment systems enabling the public to benefit more fully from the single currency, the Eurosystem has drawn up a set of objectives for cross-border retail payments in the euro area. These will be detailed in a separate press release which will be issued in the coming days. The Eurosystem calls on the banking and payment service industry to fulfil these objectives by 1 January 2002 at the latest. Finally, I would like to inform you that we also discussed issues related to fraud prevention. I would like to emphasise that the ECB shares the concerns of the European Parliament, the EU Council and the Commission about the protection of the Communities' financial interests against fraud and other detrimental activities. Consequently, for the sake of transparency, efficiency and accountability, the Governing Council decided to establish an external Supervisory Committee to enforce an Anti-Fraud Scheme at the ECB. This Committee will establish a co-operative relationship with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Noyer: We will see if there is a specific demand for liquidity that is clearly related to this period, that will probably show up in the last weeks of this year and the very beginning of next year. If this is the case, we will of course have to take due account of that in terms of disturbances in the monetary indicators. But that can be taken into account within the framework of our instruments and analysis. So, of course, if there is a special disturbance, we will have to take that into account and make an assessment excluding the exceptional factor that would then have arisen. But that is not a big problem in theory, in terms of the policy indicators. But you will remember that, when we made the choice of the monetary policy strategy last year, and we made the choice of the reference value, one of the explanations for calling that a reference value was that we were cautious for many reasons. One of the reasons was that there might have been a special shock related to the introduction of the euro. I would say the same sort of caution must be exercised with the Year 2000. There might be a shock, at least in the statistical series, and we must, of course, be prepared to deal with it. However, we have the technical capacities - we think so - to make the distinction between the trends that are behind that and any event or statistical move that would be clearly linked to a very transitional Year 2000-related shock. Well, my opinion is very brief, can be very briefly formulated: our decisions today, again and as always, were based on a euro area-wide analysis of economic and financial developments - and nothing else. And, as regards the development of M3, I can only repeat what has just been said by the Vice-President and what was said in reply to the first question we had. We have to deal with monetary figures in a structurally changed environment, monetary figures which are only of a very recent nature, and we have to interpret them with extreme caution. I would like you to put a figure on ""this somewhat higher than currently forecast."" And if you are not willing to do that, maybe you can give us an indication of what you think is currently forecast, so that we know what you think, what will be then higher than - what figure? Duisenberg:First, on the bias. It's creeping and it remains creeping - but at snail's pace, you might say. The bias was introduced by me in reply to a question. Oh, it continues to creep. And on the forecast. If you compare the forecast we had, with those of most of the international institutions as well as those of national forecasting bureaus, we have forecasts of some 80 institutions, which we regularly consult. Back in April, the general forecast was that growth this year would be in the order of 2%, that next year it would be in the order, generally speaking, of 2½%, of 2½%. We now distinctly feel that both these forecasts will be surpassed in reality. For this year, we now expect an outcome higher than we and everybody else expected in April, and the same holds true for next year. So we are distinctly, I might confirm this, more optimistic now on the outlook of the development of the real economy, both for this year and for next year, than we were three months ago. Now, before that discussion takes place and before I answer that question, I would rather have the discussion first in Turku, in which I will make my contribution, together with Mr Noyer. And then, afterwards, we can report on what role we see for the ECB. I want to emphasise that we, the ECB, will be a full participant in the broad macroeconomic dialogue that was decided upon at the Cologne Summit. Well, the message you might want to repeat is what I said in my Introductory Statement, namely to continue on the road to increasing flexibility in the labour, product and service markets, to take measures especially in a period when the economy and the economic outlook are brighter than we had foreseen earlier. It seems to be a golden opportunity to take further measures both in the sphere of reducing the fiscal deficits and in the sphere of structural measures to increase the flexibility of markets. And that is the message I give here today, via you, and I will also give it directly in Turku. I will not be tempted to indicate any specific level which is good. I publicly declare that the level at which the euro is trading now and has already been trading for 5 or 6 weeks is, to my mind, an understandable level. I am not reacting to anybody's remarks in this area and you will have noted that the word ""exchange rate"" did not appear in today's statement. And I might add that this was deliberate. Well, the answer is: No, we did not discuss it. I did not indicate a specific date when it will be discussed. It will undoubtedly be discussed at one of the forthcoming meetings, but what the result of that discussion will be, I cannot predict. Well, the answer is that we, like the Deutsche Bank, are studying and assessing the impact of developments of M3 on inflation in the medium term. And the monetary aggregate, as you know, is an important reference value underlying our policy decisions. But, at the same time - and here I come back to the first question asked - we are still at a very early stage. And it is not sure to what extent the structural and cultural shock of the introduction of the euro may itself have changed behaviour and relationships of investors and consumers across the euro area. So we have to deal with it very, very carefully and we do not yet have long enough time series for the new situation to come up with conclusions which are very similar to the conclusions that, for example, the study of the Deutsche Bank came up with on the basis of a time series extending over 40 years or so. Duisenberg:I would like to point out that the structure of the economy, especially the financial structure, and, for example, the ownership of equity and the dispersion amongst the public at large in the United States is very different from that in Europe. The general phenomenon, which the IMF pointed to, is whether asset price inflation is going on. And asset price inflation in the United States, in the first instance, expresses itself in terms of the development of the prices for equity. In Europe this phenomenon is related far more to developments in the area of real estate. Now there are some pockets of the euro area where we see a hefty development of real estate prices, but certainly not euro area-wide. Certainly not enough to give us cause for concern, but we try to monitor it as closely as we can. No, I cannot. We did not even consider the issue in the Governing Council today. We have the instrument available, in principle, to switch to a variable rate tender if we were to deem that necessary. But, from our decisions today, you can derive that we do not deem it necessary at short notice. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, your friend, Karl Otto Pöhl, after he was President of the Bundesbank, said that he did not really understand what M3 had to do with official rates. He said he never understood the correlation between the two. Now I ask you, perhaps to prevent a myth, if you think that too. Is M3 so important or is it just a way of keeping the hawks and the doves in a balance on the board? This is the only reason, he said, it was ever mentioned - to keep the hawks and the doves on the board on an equal footing? We do think, I do think, with many others, that money matters and that the developments in the monetary aggregates do have an impact over time, with a long lag, on the rate of inflation. The transmission mechanism as such is somewhat in the dark, I admit. But money matters. We understand that, and that is why we also take it as an important reference value. But only as a reference value to guide us in our policy decisions. And it has nothing to do with hawks and doves. Question (translation): Let me ask again: how strongly must the money supply M3 rise before you say that the official interest rates must rise? President: Of course, I cannot answer that question because - and I keep on coming back to it - we have to interpret the movements in M3 in a totally new environment and with totally new time series with great caution. So it would be very irresponsible if I even tried to begin to answer your question. President: We explicitly base our monetary policy decisions on - what we have publicly said - a medium-term outlook. We are not moved by the day-to-day fluctuations in economic variables as we see them, as I also indicated in my statement. We tend to attach greater importance to three-month moving figures than to the volatility of one-month figures, or even daily figures. So, from that you might derive that we are indeed not inclined to try to fine-tune the economy with monetary policy, or to give fine-tuning answers to short-term developments. So, in that aspect, you might say that we are somewhat less activist than some other central banks in the world tend to be. Noyer: It is a little bit more complicated than that. I apologise that we are not able to provide for a detailed explanation of the initiative today. What we would like to do is to ensure that the necessary structural measures within the banking system, to a certain extent also between the national central banks of the Eurosystem and the banking system, are taken so as to lower the costs, but also to increase the efficiency of the system, to increase the speed of payments and so on. It is not intended to fix the final costs and the financial relations between customers and banks - we think that it is the market that must provide for that - but to ensure that a maximum of efficiency and flexibility as well as competition between banks on that very issue does exist or is improved. So we will give details on that. We are not going to publish the amounts of fees or to give instructions to banks to change their fees and cut them by X or Y%, but to ensure that all the banks take the necessary steps to progressively provide for the same sort of service in terms of availability, quickness of delivery of payments and costs between countries that they are performing internally today. That it is the objective. They will not. Duisenberg:No, we have not said that we can deal with any liquidity crisis, as you formulated it. We can deal with an increased demand for liquidity that may arise. We do not think that the public at large should be worried at all, but we cannot help it if the public at large is worried and thus asked for greater liquidity. In that case, we can, through the banks and directly, handle any increased demand for liquidity that might arise. I do not think that interest rate policies would have an impact on the effects or the anticipated effects of the century date change. Noyer: No, just to build on what the President has said. You must bear in mind that there are two differences between the situation, let us say, in the United States - I am just taking this as an example, and could be any other large economy - and in Europe. The two differences are: first, concerning the banknotes: because the NCBs are now printing euro banknotes, they have accumulated a stock of national banknotes to cover the period between now and the Year 2000. So we actually have far more banknotes in the vaults than central banks would normally have. These stocks enable us to provide for liquidity in banknotes to a much larger extent than normal, so that, in practice, everything is as if we had prepared for a special event. But the event we have been preparing for was, of course, different. But it can also be used for that purpose. The second difference: in our monetary policy implementation framework there is a facility that does not exist in most of the other monetary policy frameworks around the world, which is what we call the marginal lending facility. Through the marginal lending facility, if there are unexpected needs, on a given day or at a given time of day, from the banking system that have not been covered through tenders, all the banks may immediately come to the Eurosystem and take all the liquidity they need. I mean, there is no ceiling to that. They can take everything they need whenever they need it, that is on 31 December or 30 December, that is no problem. The only question mark was: is there enough collateral? As you know very well, looking at the tenders, the amount of collateral is far, far higher than that which is actually used both for payment systems and for monetary policy operations. So, they could increase their liquidity value on any given day by a very high factor. So, these specific features are the fundamental reason why we say that there is no problem with liquidity. And, having said that, you can also see that it is not related to the interest rate policy conducted, because the marginal lending facility works whatever the interest rate for this facility may be. The cost for 24 hours, or even a few days, is really of minor importance. He was here, I can confirm that. He was already here yesterday afternoon, so that we already discussed it yesterday afternoon. And it had no impact on our decisions today. "
15/07/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was attended by the EU Council President, Mr. Niinistö, and by Mr. de Silguy, European Commissioner. The Governing Council reviewed the main monetary, financial and other economic indicators in line with its monetary policy strategy. As a result of its examination it decided not to change the ECB interest rates. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will thus remain 2.5%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 3.5% and that on the deposit facility has been kept at 1.5%. Let me give you some details about our latest assessment of the monetary policy stance and thereby explain the decisions taken today. With regard to monetary developments in the euro area, the three-month moving average of M3 growth, covering the period from March to May 1999, increased slightly to 5.2%, from 5.1% in the three months up to April. Consequently, M3 growth remained above the reference value of 4½%. The major contribution to the rise in M3 growth in May came from overnight deposits. With the exception of repurchase agreements, marketable securities included in M3 also experienced higher growth. The annual growth rate of total credit to euro area residents rose in May, from 7.3% in April, to 7.9%. The pick-up in credit growth was visible both in loans and in securitised lending and occurred in respect of credit to both the private sector and the general government. The growth of loans to the private sector rose to 10% in May, stimulated by the further decline in bank lending rates. Taken together with the high pace of growth of the most liquid components of M3, this evidence supports the view that households and firms in the euro area do not currently face liquidity constraints. In the view of the Governing Council, this situation is not seen as threatening price stability at present. However, a reassessment may be appropriate if money and credit growth increase further. Turning to financial market indicators, we have seen a significant upturn in long-term interest rates in the euro area since the end of May. This development was certainly affected by the continued increase in bond yields in the United States over the same period. More recently, however, domestic factors have probably played a more important role in the determination of domestic bond yields than was previously the case. These factors include financial market perceptions of more evidence pointing to a further strengthening in economic activity in the euro area during the year, accompanied by a modest pick-up in inflation expectations from the low levels seen in recent months. The more positive market sentiment regarding the prospects for euro area output growth has also been reflected in a narrowing over recent weeks of the relatively wide differentials between US and euro area bond yields. Exchange rate developments do not yet reflect these very same factors. As we have said on earlier occasions, the Governing Council believes that the euro is firmly based on internal price stability and therefore, has the clear potential to achieve a stronger external value. The Governing Council reaffirmed its view at today's meeting that the monetary policy of the Eurosystem will safeguard the euro's internal purchasing power and will thereby support its international value. The prospects for a more broadly based and sustained recovery in the world economy have become stronger. The outlook has improved further, in particular in relation to expectations of continuously strong growth in the US economy and some tentative indications that the prolonged decline in activity in Japan may have come to a halt. In addition, recent developments in economic and financial indicators for the emerging market economies suggest that a recovery is under way in South-East Asia. Moreover, to the extent that the Kosovo conflict may have had a negative impact on economic sentiment in a number of countries, its end has eliminated a risk to the outlook for economic developments in the euro area. As recent developments in Latin America indicate the outlook has improved only moderately. With reference to developments in economic activity in the euro area, some important data have been released since our last meeting. Most notably, Eurostat has now started to publish euro area national accounts data which are based more closely on data compiled in accordance with the new ESA 95 methodology. According to these estimates, the quarter-on-quarter rate of real GDP growth increased to 0.5% in the first quarter of this year, compared with 0.3% in the previous quarter. At present there is insufficient experience with regard to the properties of the new ESA 95 data, in particular their susceptibility to revision, and some caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting the most recent developments in real GDP growth. However, further evidence supporting the view that growth will recover in the course of this year is also provided by the recent development of other indicators of economic activity. Following successive declines, the level of industrial production appears to have stabilised in the months up to April. Given the developments in industrial confidence up to June, it would appear that the trough was reached at the end of the first quarter. This points to a turning-point in activity in the industrial sector. At the same time, household sector demand patterns appear to be broadly unchanged, as indicated by a still high level of consumer confidence. Therefore, while the signs of recovery are still modest and are not yet reflected in labour market developments, recent data appear to confirm the outlook for a continued improvement in the course of this year. The Governing Council considers it necessary that other policy areas make a decisive contribution to bolstering confidence in the euro area's growth potential, particularly by means of firm structural reform measures to enhance the sustainability of public finances and the efficiency of labour and product markets. Looking at the latest developments in consumer prices, the annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) fell to 1.0% in May, down from 1.1% in April. While energy prices, which had caused the rise in the overall HICP rate in the previous two months, continued to exert some upward pressure, this was more than offset by movements in other components. A lower rate of increase was recorded in May for both processed and unprocessed food prices and for services prices. Hence the decline in the overall HICP rate was also reflected in the HICP rate excluding the two more volatile components - energy and seasonal food. These developments have to be seen partly in the context of a one-off base effect resulting from country-specific increases in indirect taxes which occurred last year. Against this background, the expectation remains that over the next few months the rate of price increases will tend to edge upwards, mainly reflecting the increase in energy prices. In conclusion, the outlook for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area remains favourable and in line with the Eurosystem's definition of price stability. The Governing Council therefore decided to maintain the prevailing levels of the ECB interest rates. At the same time it noted that the sustained growth of monetary and credit aggregates, the slight improvement in output growth in early 1999, the expectation of a strengthening in economic activity in the course of 1999 and a further acceleration next year all indicate that any upward pressures on prices will have to be monitored very carefully. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to introduce two additional topics we discussed during the Governing Council meeting: In addition to reviewing the main monetary, financial and other economic indicators, the Governing Council also considered the days on which the TARGET system would be closed in the year 2000. With regard to the calendar of TARGET operating days for 1999, the ECB announced on 31 March 1999 that the TARGET system would close on 31 December 1999, in addition to Saturdays and Sundays, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. However, considering the financial and social cost of keeping the TARGET system open on days which are traditionally public holidays (or bank holidays) in most of the euro area, and in view of the indication given by the European banking industry that it would welcome the closing of TARGET on such days, the Governing Council today decided in principle that next year - in addition to Saturdays and Sundays - TARGET will be closed on New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, 1 May (Labour Day), Christmas Day and 26 December. In countries where one of these days is not a public holiday, the national central bank will endeavour to close the national RTGS system on the day in question or, when this is not possible, will seek to limit domestic payment activity as much as possible. You will find further information relating to this decision in the separate press release to be issued today. Last and certainly not least, it is my great pleasure to announce a very important milestone along the road to the introduction of the euro banknotes. The production of the euro banknotes has begun and, by the end of this month, euro banknote production will be under way in printing works in several euro area countries. As you will remember, we presented the draft euro banknote designs in December 1996. The designs were subsequently adjusted and refined in order to meet the technical specifications in full. Intensive work then began to convert the detailed designs into the origination material, in other words the final dies, films and plates which enable printing plates to be made. Production of the pilot series started in September 1998 and was completed a few months ago. The printing of this pilot series involved the production of several million banknotes under normal operating conditions. This was a success and we therefore agreed that the participating national central banks could release their printing orders. The number of euro banknotes to be printed for the 11 participating Member States before the launch - which will take place exactly 900 days from today - is estimated at 13 billion. To give you an idea of the size of the production process, if the 13 billion euro banknotes were placed end to end, they would stretch to the moon and back twice. As you may remember, the Governing Council has already decided that the euro banknotes will not bear any national symbols and, therefore, will be totally identical irrespective of where they are produced. The euro banknotes are being produced in accordance with specifications of the very highest standard and they will include a wide range of sophisticated security features. The ECB has today issued a press release on this matter. A press folder containing, inter alia, TV footage and a brochure on the euro banknotes and coins has also been made available to the media. The brochure is available in all 11 official languages of the European Union. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, for months and weeks there has repeatedly been great excitement; the value of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar has been dropping constantly. What do you think of this? Do you think that this is not a problem? Do you think it is slowly becoming a problem? Do you perhaps also believe that 1:1 is easier to remember? Does it simplify calculations? The last time I expressed myself publicly on the exchange rate, it was precisely before this group, at the press conference on 2 June this year. Now, six weeks later, I can for the first time say something about the exchange rate again and I will not say anything more than that. I am prepared to repeat what I said. We believe that the euro is firmly based on internal price stability and, therefore, has the excellent potential to achieve a stronger, external value. That view was confirmed again by the Governing Council today. The view is that the monetary policy of the Eurosystem will safeguard the euro's internal purchasing power and will thereby support its external value. That is what I had to say, what I have to say about the exchange rate. It is all that I am going to say about it. Duisenberg:Well they have differed in various Member States. In some Member States, measures have been taken to increase the flexibility of the economy in certain respects. But, looking at the euro area as a whole, it is certainly far from sufficient. Many, many more structural measures have to be taken in most, if not all, of the euro area Member States. What I have said is that we do not see price stability as being threatened at present. But, if money and credit growth increases further, a re-assessment may be appropriate. You could interpret that, not as a bias, but as a bias gradually creeping into our considerations. We did not explicitly discuss investors' confidence in the euro, but we did, very explicitly, discuss the development of the euro, which includes, of course, an assessment of investors' confidence. As our answer, we expressed our strong belief that the success of our policy to maintain price stability would, over time, underline and underscore the inherent strength of the euro. It is the same. . and I added ""morecredit growth"". No, that is not a problem. But it requires a careful assessment and judgement about what is actually happening and going on - also in the monetary world. And that is, under the new circumstances, somewhat more difficult than it used to be in the past before the euro was created. Question (translation): Two questions. The first, on the confidence of the markets in the euro. If the Monthly Bulletin is read carefully, one gains the impression that the Governing Council, or economists at the ECB, are taking a somewhat new look at the interest rate cut of April, because the econometric models had already indicated an economic recovery in the first quarter. Is the difficulty in understanding your interest rate cut perhaps also a reason for the euro not having gained the confidence in the markets that it should have had in terms of its internal stability? The second question concerns fiscal policy in the euro area. On Monday you submitted a financial report to the ECOFIN Council concerning the fulfilment of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is now being discussed. How do you regard the statements on the Stability Pact, for instance those of the Planning Council in Paris, that are placing this Pact in question, because it might curb the growth momentum. What results did the discussion of this matter by the Governing Council have? That was a very long question, I will ask Mr. Noyer to answer the second part. But, as far as the first part is concerned, the key word was ""confidence"" and another key expression was ""our interest rate decision of 8 April"". All I can say is that circumstances may change and I have already answered the question about the bias, using the word ""creeping in"". We do not in any way regret our decision of 8 April. We believe that this was an appropriate decision at the appropriate moment and, of course, the effects of monetary policy decisions will become evident only with a very long time lag. In the meantime, what we do want is to maintain the climate of stability, of stability-oriented policies, as perceived by the public - and as it must be perceived by the public. Noyer: On the second question. I suppose that you make reference to a report that was issued by a working group of an economic institute, a kind of a think-tank, even if it has an official name - Commission General de Plan. In fact, today it works like any economic institute undertaking research. That report did contain the remark you are referring to and this has been firmly denied by the French Government, very officially, and several times by the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister of France. For us, there is no such indication at all, as you have said. Christian, you went to the ECOFIN. Can you give a report on individual criteria? Noyer: No, unfortunately, I cannot give any report. I think reference is made to a report that had traditionally been made by the European Monetary Institute during the time of the preparation of all the decisions on which countries would join the euro area from the beginning. That report was taking care of all criteria. The ECB has simply continued this practice. Not because there is any possible consequence, but because we have the technical knowledge and habit of doing this with the help of all the national central banks of the Eurosystem. It might be helpful for governments to have a number of technical analyses in looking at their own fiscal stances. It does not look at all at the short term, of course. It looks more at the medium term and at the risks that may arise if a number of improvements are not pursued and if there are adverse developments in the medium or long term in, for instance, the real economy. But, to take the most obvious example: if the governments were all sticking to exactly 3% and then, in the case of a future recession, it would obviously be extremely difficult for governments to not breach the 3%. So, we say in that case there is a strong reason why sticking to the Stability and Growth Pact will give you the room for manoeuvre. That is the global assessment. But it does not point to any risk of such a development in the short term. First, because progress has been made, and second, because economic developments are going to look better, as the President has explained. So it cannot be concluded from this that there is a risk in the foreseeable future. In the analysis that we have done many times, and that has been very clear to all of you, either from the Monthly Bulletins or from other publications, we have repeatedly said that an actual implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, and of the programmes that all countries have designed for themselves, are very important as a safeguard against any kind of downward trend in the future. It does not mean that we foresee that there will be any slowdown of economic growth in the foreseeable future. So there is no immediate implication for one country or another. Noyer: Well, there is an analysis of all countries - yes. But it is not pointing at a specific risk of a breach in specific countries. For all countries, it analyses the strengths and weaknesses in the fiscal consolidation process which, of course, are different - the balance is different from one country to the other. But it is not pointing at certain countries in saying that there is a special risk of breaching the 3%. This is not the objective of the analysis. It is more to give analytical help to countries to better shape their process of fiscal consolidation. And to add one sentence, as I told you, the meeting today was attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council, Mr. Niinistö, and - I must say to our great satisfaction - he reported that the ECOFIN Council had at its last meeting unanimously endorsed its commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact, and we were very pleased with that. As far as the 50 billion euro in foreign reserves are concerned, I do not think that they have already been turned over. And it is not that important either, because all foreign exchange reserves already come under the management of the ECB, whether they are in the hand of or still in the coffers of the national central banks. The third question on the appearance of the banknotes: don't read to much in that. Essentially, nothing has changed. To give you one example why the banknotes - when they are issued - will look slightly different from those that were published as illustrations some time ago: in those that have been published, there was a fake signature. Ultimately, there will be my signature - that is the difference! And another difference, to mention another example, is that the banknotes also bear the word ""EURO"" in Greek letters. In the ultimate series the word ""EURO"" will still be there in Greek letters, but it will be somewhat shadier than in those published earlier. It was not discussed today. It will be discussed in the coming months. Whether the system will change is still open. Yes, we do intend to be as open and transparent as we possibly can. And, as your colleague had already concluded from the Monthly Bulletin, there might have been some slight change in tone that was confirmed today in my statement, and we will monitor the developments in the months to come very carefully. Noyer: The first question: actually, the material was not stolen near Paris, as far as I know, but nobody knows where it disappeared. Somewhere in the air probably. It was a cross-border transfer. But the real answer is that it has not been found, but it could not have been used, because it was not final. The stolen material is of no use at all. We have changed the features to have something that is absolutely safe. I can take the second question. Is it a problem: no. When there are 10 printing works producing these banknotes, it is monitored very, very carefully that they are identical across the 10 printing works involved. I might add that the start of production yesterday was a total success in all printing works. That is correct. The answer is ""no"". We will not reveal at this time specifics of the extensive safety features which have been incorporated into the new banknotes, but we will start an extensive information campaign well before the actual issuance of the banknotes to make the public and the experts, the cashiers at banks and in the retail sector, very familiar with the safety features, as they have been incorporated. The short-term interest rates have hardly moved over the past six weeks. The three-month interest rates were at 2.6% and, in the last few days, they have moved up to 2.7%. So, that is not a cause for concern. At the long end of the yield curve there has been a significant move to an average yield for government paper of now 4.9%, which is one of the factors I have discussed in my introductory statement. It is not a cause of concern which would, in our opinion, threaten price stability. But this has to be monitored very closely. We continuously assess that and we then come to the same conclusions that you had formulated so adequately in the article you published yesterday. Well, that is an unrealistic prospect. We do agree - both politicians and the ECB - that it is important to speak with one voice, even if we do it through many mouths. "
02/06/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General and Governing Councils of the ECB. At its meeting today, the Governing Council reviewed, as usual, the main monetary, financial and other economic indicators in line with its monetary policy strategy. Following this discussion, it saw no need to change the interest rates on the ECB's monetary policy instruments. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations thus remains 2.5%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility continues to be 3.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility is maintained at 1.5%. Let me give you some details about our current assessment of the monetary policy stance, and thereby provide explanations for the decisions taken today. With regard to monetary developments in the euro area, the 12-month growth rate of M3 decreased from 5.2% in March to 4.9% in April. This decline was accounted for mainly by a contraction in deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years, which in turn may have been connected with some portfolio shifts towards longer-term financial instruments not included in M3. The three-month moving average of the M3 growth rates covering February to April 1999 fell to 5.0% from 5.3% in the previous three-month period covering the first quarter of 1999, thereby moving closer to the reference value of 4½%. Against this background, the Governing Council took the view that current monetary developments are in line with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. The Governing Council also took note that the figures for credit growth were revised downwards significantly for early 1999 and that the annual growth rate of total credit declined to 6.4% in April 1999. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector nonetheless remained relatively high in April 1999, at 8.4%. This suggests that households and firms are at present exploiting the favourable interest rate conditions to finance their consumption and investment plans. As regards financial indicators, long-term government bond yields in the euro area have increased since the end of April. In our view, this upward movement of long-term bond yields primarily reflected a spillover of developments in the US bond market, where a larger increase was seen. At the same time, there was little indication that developments in euro area bond yields reflected any change in market expectations for inflation in the euro area. Against this background, we have observed a further slight widening of the differential between US and euro area long-term interest rates since end-April. In addition, since short-term interest rates were broadly unchanged in the euro area during May, the euro area yield curve slightly steepened. Turning to exchange rate developments, the Governing Council noted that from the start of Stage Three to 1 June the euro depreciated by 7.7% when measured in nominal effective terms. Vis-à-vis the US dollar the exchange rate declined from around 1.18 to 1.04 over the same period. The current effective exchange rate leveI broadly corresponds to those observed in summer 1997 and spring 1998. In the view of the Governing Council the major economic factor behind these short term developments is constituted by cyclical divergences between the euro area and the United States, which are expected to diminish over the course of this year and thereafter. The euro is a currency firmly based on internal price stability and therefore has a clear potential for a stronger external value. Since the start of Stage Three of EMU the euro has become the second most important international currency in the world, and the policy of the Eurosystem will safeguard its internal purchasing power, thereby also supporting the international role of the euro. As already mentioned, nominal long-term interest rates are low by any historical standard, reflecting the confidence of global investors in the euro. Looking at recent developments in the world economy, the risks seem to have become more balanced. Among other factors, this relates to somewhat firmer expectations that the growth of the US economy will remain strong in the near future. In addition, there now seems to be less danger of contagion effects among emerging market economies, given that economic and financial conditions have improved in a number of countries, notably in South-East Asia. For the euro area, essentially no additional data on real economy indicators have become available since our last meeting. On the basis of currently available data the picture remains unchanged: there was a noticeable slowdown at the end of last year and there is only limited evidence as yet that activity may have seen a turnaround in the course of the first months of 1999. At the same time, when considering the broad outlook for economic developments, the Governing Council today agreed that more favourable conditions for a recovery in the course of 1999 and stronger growth thereafter are in place. For the euro area to better exploit its growth and employment potential, decisive structural measures in other fields of economic policy are urgently needed. In this context, it is crucial that the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact are strictly adhered to. With regard to the latest data on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the annual increase for April was 1.1%, up by 0.1 percentage point from the rate of increase in the previous month. As in March, when the overall rate of consumer price increases rose by 0.2 percentage points, the rise in April was caused by increases in energy prices. However, in April, the upward movement in energy prices has been partly offset by developments in prices for other goods and services. Excluding the HICP components for energy and seasonal food, the rate of increase in consumer prices in April was 1.0%, declining from 1.1% in the two previous months. In conclusion, given recent monetary trends and the development of other indicators, the outlook for price developments remains in line with the objective to maintain price stability. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to maintain the ECB interest rates at the current levels. Other business In addition, it gives me great pleasure to announce the launch of the ECB's Working Paper Series. The initial publication consists of five papers, the titles of which are listed in a separate press releasethat will be issued to you this afternoon. The papers have been available on the ECB's Web site since noon today. We are now at your disposal should you have any questions. Your first question was: ""do I regard it as possible that the exchange rate would reach the level of one to one to the US dollar?"" I will not join in the speculative mood that seems to be vivid around the world. So, I will not comment on any such possibility. The second question was: ""are there differences of view on the decision by the Finance Ministers to slightly amend the conditions for the Stability and Growth Pact for Italy?"" The answer is: there are no differences of view. I mentioned in my introduction that the economic factor, and I underline that word, was the main explanation. There are, of course, other factors which I did not mention, i.e. the war in Kosovo, which certainly also has a somewhat different impact on the euro than on the US dollar. Now, as far as devaluation is concerned, may I repeat what I said: the euro is a currency which is firmly based on internal price stability and therefore has a clear potential for a stronger external value. I think that should be ""crystal clear"". Well, the message to the summit in Cologne is clear. That is contained in the statement that I made today and, as far as the particular point is concerned, I would like to point out that the decision of the Ministers of Finance has been on Italy. What we are talking about is that budgetary policy should aim at limiting any slippage from the target of a total deficit of 2% of GDP which, in any event, will stay below 2.4%. So I would like to underline that the emphasis is still on the 2%. The broad economic policy guidelines say that, in any event, it will stay below 2.4%. I would be dishonest if I did not say that this was some loosening compared to earlier intentions or guidelines. It certainly does not run counter to the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact. But, may I repeat what I have said before elsewhere in public: if this were to become a trend across Europe, then there would be a real reason for concern. That is the reason why the Governing Council today also pleaded for a strict adherence to the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact. On the first question, the adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact, I would like to point out that the Stability and Growth Pact prescribes that over the medium term, the government deficits should have disappeared. Budgets should be in equilibrium or even show a small surplus. That target, seen over the medium term, has not been changed in any way in the meantime, not by the Ministers of Finance either. They are still sticking to, luckily, I am inclined to say, to the medium-term target of a balanced budget or a small surplus. In the precise wording of the Finance Ministers' decision, if you refer to Italy, it contains the explicit warning that reaching the objective of 1% of GDP in 2001 could require additional corrective measures on a larger scale than envisaged. So, the objective is still there and I am very happy about that. On the question, ""what would you say if one euro was one dollar?"", I would say that one euro is one euro. By that I mean that the crucial thing is that we seem to be achieving our aim, which is to maintain price stability. So the purchasing power of the people of Europe is not being undermined by an inflation rate which would be in excess of our target. I think, that is the main thing. The guarantee that we are trying to give to the people of Europe, and actually are giving, is that there will be no inflation in the sense of a price increase of more than 2%. Actually, we are at 1%. We expect to remain in that neighbourhood in the course of this year, and next year. There may be a slight increase due to temporary factors which are, in particular, the rising energy prices that are working their way through to the price level. That is, by definition, just as much as the decline in inflation was partly due to temporary factors, such as the falling energy prices last year. Now it is a temporary factor that may temporarily lead to somewhat higher inflation, but it is our view that over the medium term - I am looking toward the end of the year 2000 at least - the average rate of inflation will remain relatively low. The maximum we have set for ourselves and for Europe will be well below 2%. Well, I only saw one of them today. The one I saw seemed to be in a quite happy mood. I am not going to say anything myself about being concerned or not. These very short-term volatile movements in the exchange rate, I am inclined to play them down. As I said in my introductory statement, in the longer run, as I have often said publicly, I have seen more factors pointing towards an appreciation of the euro than that I can see factors pointing to a depreciation of the euro. And so, these temporary developments, like the quite normal occurrence of the cyclical divergence between the United States and Europe, of course have an impact on the relationship between the two currencies. The quite abnormal thing, the Kosovo war, also has an impact on the exchange rate of the euro. Well, that is about what I want to say about it. What I want to emphasise is that, over a longer period, I have full confidence in the actual performance of the euro. No, we all agreed that we have to make quite an effort to speak with ""one voice"" because the song we are singing does not differ at all, but we sometimes need some repetition to achieve full harmony. It has always been our view that automatic stabilisers are necessary. To let them play their role, you have to create adequate room for manoeuvre for the deficit to move in reaction to cyclical developments as are taking place. Now, we are not quite sure in the Italian case, and I will not comment further on that specific country, on the extent to which the disappointing growth performance so far is due to cyclical or to structural factors. And it certainly is the case that Italy, due to the composition of its exports, has been harder hit by the crisis in south-east Asia. But that could be qualified as a structural factor in as far as the crisis would have lasting effects. It is true that there is little room as yet for the automatic stabilisers to do their work. Let me say this about it: I derive great comfort from the fact that, also in the case of Italy, the ultimate objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact have remained intact and that is a pledge by the Italian Government also. That has remained intact: to achieve a deficit of no more than 1% in 2001 and to go beyond that thereafter. That is a difficult question. I think we should keep doing what we are doing. The relevance of what we are doing will become fully clear and transparent once the confidence we have in the future of the euro is rewarded by the facts. Question (translation): Mr. President, have you been invited to participate in the so-called European partnership for employment? Will you accept that invitation and what could you contribute to it? I have received no such invitation. Let me first answer the procedural question. I am not afraid that our image will suffer through these mishaps. The mishap of four weeks ago is still questionable as to whether it was a mishap. What happened today is simply that I was aware of the fact that it had been agreed to release the statement on interest rates for the next two refinancing tenders at 1:45 p.m. and, actually, the member of the staff who put it on the Web site apparently had his watch set wrongly, so he inadvertently, and I apologise for that, already put it on the Web-site at 1:40 p.m. All that we can do about this is to give statements, as we have done today, whatever the repercussions in the political arena might be. We have given clear explanations for the movements of the euro/dollar exchange rate and we have said the major economic factor causing that is the cyclical divergence between Europe and the United States. And I think that should be enough. I do not see that danger at all. On the first question, you did not see the figures for the ECB. What you saw were the figures of the consolidated statement for the European System of Central Banks, that means the ECB plus the national central banks. Therefore, you cannot attribute the decline of EUR 2.8 billion in reserves to any single one of the twelve institutions included in that consolidated balance sheet. These movements are quite normal; they may have something to do with government purchases of military equipment abroad or whatever things have to be paid. So, there is nothing much further that I can say about that. On the increase in the foreign exchange reserves, I want to recall that the Treaty stipulates that immediately after the establishment of the European Central Bank - literally, that would mean immediately after the first of June last year - the ECB and/or the Commission have to make a proposal to further increase the reserves of the ECB - that is an obligation. Why that obligation? Because at the time the Treaty was drafted it was impossible to determine with any degree of precision what amount of reserves would be optimal for the ECB's purposes. Now, it still is quite difficult to do and, indeed, we have now drafted and agreed on a recommendation to increase the amount of reserves to be turned over to the ECB - a recommendation which has, that is the procedure, to end up in a Regulation adopted by the EU Council. Today, we have agreed on the recommendation which will be sent to the EU Council and which will hopefully be transformed into a Regulation. I will not comment on interventions. I will comment on interventions when it is necessary to do so, but not today. Regarding the level of reserves, we have recommended to the EU Council, for the time being, to double the amount of reserves, but leaving the question open whether in the future so-called ""further -further -calls"" of reserves could be made. So, we do not have a specific level in mind. Sorry, I did not get the last question. First of all, the issue of intervention was discussed only to the extent, if I may disclose something of the meeting, that I asked what should I answer if a journalist asked me ""have there been interventions?"" And the suggestion I got from a colleague was: ""on interventions, we do not speak, unless we regard it as necessary."" So, that deals with the first question. Secondly, on structural measures - well, I am in danger of repeating myself, but we do place all the emphasis on all our policy recommendations. You might say that, to tackle the major problem that Europe has, i.e. the high level of unemployment, given that it is caused only partially and to a minor extent by cyclical factors and to a major extent by insufficient flexibility in the markets for labour, goods and services, call urgently for precise measures that differ from country to country to increase the flexibility of the labour market and to increase the flexibility of the markets for goods and services, e.g. opening hours of shops, etc. That would basically tackle the problem of unemployment. It will also, by implication, be a long drawn-out process. On interventions: Whatever we discussed in the Governing Council that did not lead to certain decisions, I am not going to tell you. Regarding interest rates, I am not aware of such sharp movements. Given that there has been a relatively sharp increase in long-term interest rates in the United States, that itself has its spill-over effects in Europe, also causing long-term rates in Europe to rise somewhat, which - by itself - is normal. I am satisfied that this has happened only to a limited extent, because it demonstrates that long-term inflationary expectations in Europe have not changed. The budgetary impact of the Kosovo war has not been discussed. We may have tried to make some rough estimates - while the war is still going on - of what the cost might be. In our estimates, the conclusion is that in no way would they have an impact on achieving the aims of the Stability and Growth Pact. In that way, as it may seem, it is bearable from the budgetary point of view. I do indeed participate in the dialogue with the European Finance Ministers in the context of the Euro -11 and ECOFIN meetings, together with the Vice-President. We do participate in all those dialogues. I simply answered the specific question asked by your German colleague, namely whether I had been invited to participate in the ""Bündnis für Arbeit"" negotiations. And, for that, I have not received a specific invitation and I do not expect to receive one. That is because, and this is quite a crucial point, the Eurosystem has a clear mandate, namely to maintain price stability. That is our mandate, as defined in the Treaty. That mandate does not allow for - let me call it - an ex ante co-ordination of policies, fiscal and monetary and wage policies. Doing that would mean that, in some way or other, the ECB would dilute its original mandate, namely the achievement of price stability. The main indicators thereof are the recovery we see under way in parts of south-east Asia, in some countries at least; the only real exception being Japan which continues to be a cause of concern. All the other south-east Asian countries seem to be crawling out of the trough. The stabilisation, though to a different extent, we see in Latin America and the continued - may I add, unexpectedly - strong growth in the United States are all factors that make us conclude that the conditions for a recovery are in place. And now, the recovery has to happen and we are convinced it will happen. It is not something we strive for. But that it has the effect you mentioned cannot be denied. As always, I see no reason whatsoever to disagree with what my esteemed colleague Issing has said. If we had, I would not tell you, like one of the out-countries has done. That is a matter of tactics. But there is no such intention. I will come to that judgement after the decision has been taken and not before. We have had a second exercise in forecasting, together with all the national central banks. We are still in the process of finalising that and we are in the process of placing it in the context of transparency. I will say the same as I always say in the European Parliament: There will come a time when we will also publish forecasts; we are sure of that. But we have to prepare ourselves a little bit better before we can do that. The actual indications are that we see no reasons to differ substantially from the European Commission's forecast. No, I have no such fears, because, on average, as I just implicitly said in the answer to the previous question, our expectations for euro area-wide growth are for a recovery in the course of this year and a further acceleration in the course of 2000, with growth percentages well over two percent. By implication, that means that I do not fear that the performance of the specific countries you mentioned would have a negative contagious effect. "
06/05/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council reviewed, as usual, the main monetary, financial and other economic indicators in line with its monetary policy strategy. Following this discussion it decided to keep the ECB's interest rates unchanged. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations will thus remain 2.5%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 3.5% and that on the deposit facility will remain 1.5%. Let me give you some details about our latest assessment of the monetary policy stance and thereby provide explanations for the decisions taken today. Overall, monetary developments and our broadly based assessment of future price developments do not signal dangers to price stability over the short and medium term. With regard to monetary developments in the euro area, in March 1999 the 12-month rate of growth of M3 remained constant at 5.1%. While the pace of increase in overnight deposits reduced further, signalling the waning influence of the uncertainties surrounding the launch of the euro, deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years grew at a stronger pace in March than in February 1999. The latest figure for the three-month moving average of M3 growth, covering the first quarter of 1999, was 5.2%. This was 0.2 percentage point higher than in the previous three-month period, covering the period December 1998 to February 1999. The Governing Council also noted that the annual rate of growth of total credit was broadly stable at 7.5% in March 1999. In line with the assessment it had made on the occasion of its previous meetings, the Governing Council took the view that recent monetary trends should not be seen as a warning signal with regard to the future evolution of inflation. As we have emphasised in the past, the monetary data in early 1999 may be affected by the special circumstances related to the changeover to Stage Three of EMU. In addition, the three-month moving average of M3 growth remains relatively close to the reference value of 4½%. As regards financial indicators, I should like to stress that recent developments in bond yields in the euro area were accompanied by some decoupling of yields from those in the United States, as differentials between euro area long-term interest rates and comparable rates in the United States have widened. As regards the evolution of the world economy, recent developments tend to confirm the picture of a mild overall improvement in the external environment beyond the euro area. As before, however, the main features range from continuously strong growth of the US economy to continuously weak output in Japan. For the euro area, only a few additional data for economic indicators have become available, and the assessment of forthcoming GDP developments is currently complicated by the fact that the next release will be based on revised data in accordance with the new concept of the European System of Accounts (ESA 95). Industrial production declined at the beginning of this year, and data on retail sales volumes suggest that the pace of growth slowed down somewhat around the turn of the year, but recently there are preliminary indications of some improvement. Recent developments in the labour market show a somewhat decelerating employment growth towards the end of last year. The rate of unemployment remained unchanged in March 1999, following two consecutive declines in January and February. Industrial confidence declined further in the first quarter of 1999, but preliminary April figures from the European Commission point to a slight improvement. Given the latest developments up to April, it would appear that consumer confidence reached a peak at the beginning of this year since when it has moderated slightly. As expected, the trend towards decreasing inflation rates appears to have been reversed in March. In March the annual rate of increase of consumer prices as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was 1.0%, compared with 0.8% in the previous four months. This was essentially a consequence of the substantial rise in oil prices which began in mid-February feeding through to energy prices in the HICP. In addition, unprocessed food prices have continued to exert some upward pressure on overall price increases in recent months. Excluding the more volatile HICP components of energy and food, the rate of increase in consumer prices in March remained at 1.1% - i.e. unchanged from the rate observed in February and marginally lower than that recorded at the turn of the year. In conclusion, at this point in time the general outlook for price stability remains favourable. Although the lower effective exchange rate of the euro and the rise in oil prices may lead to some upward pressure on headline HICP inflation in the coming months, the current economic situation is likely to contribute to containing this upward pressure. At the same time, current monetary developments and other available indicators do not point to inflationary risks over the medium term. On the basis of this assessment the Governing Council decided to keep the ECB's interest rates at their current levels. In additionto reviewing the mainmonetary, financial and other economic indicators, the Governing Council considered a report prepared by the ECB's Banking Supervision Committee on ""The effects of technology on the EU banking systems"". The report assesses the extent to which technological developments have taken place and are expected to occur in the EU banking systems, the main categories of banking risks affected by these developments and the strategic responses that EU banks are devising. The Governing Council agreed to publish the report, which will be made available in due course. We are now at your disposal should you have any questions. I should like to contradict you with respect to your last statement. Over the past few days the euro has been strengthening. Just last week it was at a level of USD 1.0550. When I entered this conference hall it was at a level of USD 1.08. So, I am still not concerned, but have seen with some appreciation, I might even use this term, the recent appreciation of the euro. Let me only say that in today's statement, which reflects the decision of the Governing Council, this is still it. No, we did not speak differently. But we were somewhat concerned that it had been alluded in the European Parliament that we were following a policy of neglect vis-à-vis the euro, so that we deliberately wanted to contradict that. We are not, by any means, neglecting the exchange rate of the euro. We regard the exchange rate as one of the main indicators we follow in assessing the outlook for price movements and price stability over the medium term. So, that is what we discussed and what we decided to emphasise, which is not a change of policy, only a confirmation of policy which apparently did not come across sufficiently well. I am aware of what has been reported. I think that, if he said that, we should ask for some foregiveness in this particular case because it happens that the spokesman you quote is celebrating his 65th birthday today. It has not. If there were different opinions in the Council, I would not tell you about it. But I can tell you that, of course, all these matters are subject of discussion. And in all cases in our history, which is admittedly not a long history, we have easily been able to reach a consensus about our views and, of course, sometimes someone enters the discussion with a view which may differ from the view that is being held at the end of the discussion. There is no way to define or discover, at least I could not do that, a split in thinking or differences of views which are of any significance. Noyer: No, it was not an omission. Normally, we simply mentioned the number of weeks between two Council meetings. There is no particular intention behind that. That will be for the next two weeks, yes. It is too early to assess the impact of a conflict, that has not yet ended, on future budgetary developments. We are actively studying that. But it is too early still to come to conclusions. For the time being, we do not think that it should, nor that it will have a significant impact on budgetary developments. In the future, it might lead to a re-arrangement of priorities within budgets. I do not exclude that. But as for the impact on the euro, as you have mentioned it, it is true to say that the news that comes by the hour on the conflict in Yugoslavia has an impact on the volatility of the euro. Just when I was entering this room, there was a statement by the Vice-President of the United States, which immediately caused the euro to lose a couple of hundredths of a percent, but then, maybe, there already is another statement which goes in the other direction. So, the volatility has increased. We believe it is too early to assess what the basic reasons are that the euro has been, let me call it, recovering so strongly in the last few days. Excluding, as I just did, the war from those considerations, we have not yet seen signs of a significant improvement of, let me call them, the fiscal authorities. Now that we know all the stabilisation programmes which have been introduced or published, we see an only moderate further decline in public deficits across ""Euroland"" - very moderate, on average - which still leaves the combined deficit for ""Euroland"" in the year 2001 or 2002 at a level above that which is called for by the Stability and Growth Pact. So, in that sense, our concerns have not diminished. Question (translation): What was your impression of the meeting of the G7 countries where you represented the euro and monetary policy, while the Euro 11 Ministers of Finance have not yet agreed on how they should present themselves there. Do you regard this as a problem or not? And another question: the German-French Financial and Economic Council will be meeting next Sunday in France. The President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and the President of the Banque de France will be meeting there. Is this institution, this arrangement, really still appropriate now that we have a Monetary Union? What are your views on this? Will you be attending the meeting? The results of the G7 meeting have been communicated to you in an extensive communiqué. It was not the first time I participated. It was the third time that I participated in the G-7 meeting on behalf of the European System of Central Banks. I was in a position there to explain and discuss monetary policy aspects of euro area politics. For fiscal policies, of course, I am not competent to speak. But for monetary policies and a discussion of the general economic outlook for the euro area, I was fully competent and that was recognised. And I was able actively to participate in the discussion. On the French-German combination, the national central bank governors will be present. I assume they will be there in their traditional role, which is still their role and will remain their role, as the main economic advisor of their government and, to that extent, I have no objections whatsoever, and I have no inclination to be present either. Noyer:We think that, for the moment, it is extremely difficult to assess, because every time we have a different configuration. The number of counterparties taking part in the operations changes. There has been an evolution, an evolution more in the main refinancing operations than in the long-term refinancing operations. We have had, of course, a very sharp increase in the allocation ratio at the end of the maintenance period. Now it is declining again. We do not have - and we all share this view - we do not have the experience to make a final judgement on that and on whether we should stay on that sort of level. That would be the real problem to be addressed. So we have decided to wait and gain a little more experience before making a final assessment on that. For the time being, we think that it could very well be that the allotment ratio will come up again, to a certain point of equilibrium, but it is not possible to make a final judgement. The specific question being the last one, how to organise the European Commission. There is no role for the ECB in that respect. There is, of course, only incidental information across ""Euroland"" about the areas in which wage contracts have been concluded. At an earlier stage we already indicated that there were instances where wage settlements seem to have been concluded well in excess of the likely rise in productivity and that itself is one of the risks we see for the future. But it is not enough of a risk to make us concerned about the future inflationary developments. Otherwise, we would not have lowered the interest rates a few weeks ago. No, I know that every word I say is being interpreted differently by different people. So I can only emphasise that in my words and in my thinking there is no bias. Yes, there is no bias, and that means none in either direction. "
08/04/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Let me start with the Governing Council's discussion of recent economic developments and the decisions that the Governing Council has taken today in the field of monetary policy. After an in-depth review of recent monetary, financial and economic developments, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate for the ECB's main refinancing operations will, from next week on, be set at 2.50%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be lowered to 3.50% and the interest rate on the deposit facility to 1.50% with effect from tomorrow. Let me report in some more detail on the reasons for which the Governing Council, in the context of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, deemed it appropriate to lower interest rates. As regards monetary developments in the euro area, the acceleration of monetary aggregates seen in January 1999 was partly reversed in February. The 12-month growth rate of M3 declined from 5.6% in January to 5.2% in February. This largely reflected a slowdown in the high pace of growth of overnight deposits, presumably reflecting the unwinding of the influence of some special factors related to the start of Stage Three and the introduction of the euro. As the February figures were somewhat higher than those observed in late 1998, the three-month moving average of M3 growth covering the period from December 1998 to February 1999 still increased by 0.2 percentage point to 5.1%. The Governing Council does not regard current monetary trends as constituting a signal of future inflationary pressures, taking into account that the rate of growth of M3 is still close to the reference value of 4½% and considering that it may to some extent mirror the specific environment related to the start of Stage Three. The Governing Council noted that the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rates of increase for the euro area have now been below 1% for several months, and even though some increases are likely to be seen in coming months owing to the reversal of energy price trends, the more lasting effect on the outlook for future prices comes from the economic environment. Indeed, reflecting the economic environment, many projections for future consumer price increases in the euro area have been revised downwards. In our current assessment of the situation, it appears unlikely that HICP increases will be out of line with the Eurosystem's definition of price stability. With regard to financial indicators, both bond and foreign exchange markets were lately under the influence of global factors. After having risen somewhat in February 1999, in tandem with US bond yields, during March euro area government bond yields remained broadly unchanged. At the same time the US dollar strengthened further in recent weeks in the light of international developments. When looking in some more detail at the evolution of the world economy, positive signs relate to the continuously strong growth of the US economy, the gradual recovery in some Asian countries and indications of a stabilisation in Latin America. However, there is no noticeable evidence as yet of a turnaround in Japan. In the euro area, overall growth prospects worsened towards the end of last year, as reported when we met in early March. In the meantime, official data confirm that real GDP growth in the euro area weakened in the fourth quarter of 1998, when compared with the previous quarter. The weakness is particularly apparent in the manufacturing sector, where confidence deteriorated further. Partial information covering a substantial part of the euro area appears to confirm this picture. Most recent data on total employment in the euro area point to a certain deceleration in net job creation in the last quarter of 1998. As regards the latest available data on the HICP, the annual increase in consumer prices has remained unchanged at 0.8% over several months up to February 1999. Underlying this stable rate of price increases have been offsetting developments at the level of services and goods prices. In February, services price increases moderated further slightly, mainly owing to downward adjustments in prices in the telecommunication area. At the same time, goods prices contributed slightly more to overall HICP increases than before, due both to price developments for unprocessed food and a deceleration in the fall in energy prices. It may be worth noting that goods prices may continue to move upwards temporarily, in particular as oil prices increased strongly from mid-February onwards. Such movements reflect the higher volatility of price changes of some categories of goods, in particular imported oil and other commodities. The interest rate decision has been taken in a forward-looking perspective, focusing on the medium-term trends in inflation and the compatibility of these trends with the Eurosystem's definition of price stability. In the view of the Governing Council, monetary growth is - at the current juncture - not a risk for future price stability. The decision taken today keeps monetary policy on a longer-term stability-oriented course and, by doing so, contributes to creating an economic environment in which the considerable growth potential of the euro area could be exploited. Those responsible for other policy areas are urged now even more to take the necessary steps to improve longer-term growth prospects for the euro area through strictly and decisively adhering to the aims of the Stability and Growth Pact and through convincing structural reforms in the economy. I should now like to inform you about some of the other matters considered today. The Governing Council examined the outcome of a test run of the production of euro banknotes. This so-called zero production run involved the printing works of the participating countries. The main purposes of this test were, first, to check the compliance of the ""test banknotes"" against the technical specifications and, second, to prove that all printing works are in a position to produce the euro banknotes to the same high quality standards. The result of this test was positive, as only some minor technical specifications need to be modified slightly. The printing works will now start their final preparations for the commencement of the mass production of the euro banknotes. The Governing Council also decided to establish an Analysis Centre for Counterfeit Euro Banknotes. As is already indicated by its name, the main purpose of this Analysis Centre will be to technically analyse and classify new types of printed counterfeits, and to store the related technical data in a database. The Analysis Centre will be located at the ECB in Frankfurt. We are now at your disposal should you have any questions. First of all, as far as the exchange rate of the euro is concerned, I always like to take a slightly longer term perspective than is normally done in articles and considerations about it. I would like to point out that, if you look at the rate of the euro, and look back to what we - in our jargon - call the synthetic euro, the euro that you can calculate before the euro was in existence, then you can observe that the rate of the euro to the dollar has been more or less stable at around a level of USD 1.08 to USD 1.10 from the middle of 1997 until early September 1998. In the middle of September it started to rise to reach a level of 1.16 at the end of the year, and that was the level at which we entered the euro era. After 1 January it gradually declined again in a few weeks to a level of around USD 1.08. So, we have no reason at all to be dissatisfied with that level. It is about the level at which the euro had stood for more than a year. And now - to take a very short outlook, between 6.15 and 6.30 today - the euro rose from USD 1.08 to USD 1.0865. I hope that answers your question. No, you cannot draw this conclusion. We are sticking to our definition of price stability which says that we regard price stability as being an increase in the rate of inflation of below 2%. And what I said today is that the present situation and the prospects for the increase in the rate of inflation are such that they seem, for as far as we can look forward, also to remain well below that ceiling of 2%. So, inflation is not a danger, which enabled us to, let me say, to pay more attention to the second area of objectives of the European Central Bank - that is to support the general economic policies of the European Community. The mood was good. We had a very long and, I must say, very interesting discussion today. There were a few who were not very inclined to do something about the rate - but here I talk about a very few - and a very large majority was inclined to do something and supported the proposal as we put it before the Council. And so, we had a very good discussion. For the final decision, I am afraid I have to tell you that we did not take a vote. But we know all the different views and so, finally, I could conclude as follows: the Governing Council decides that the main refinancing rate will be lowered from 3% to 2.5%. No, we also see no risks of deflation emerging. We see that inflation has now remained, on a euro area-wide basis, constant at a rate of 0.8% four months in a row up to now. We see some risks on the upside, i.e. mainly the impact of rising energy prices, but that is by definition, as it was when it was on the downside, a temporary factor. We see some risks deriving from some wage settlements here and there in Europe, those are the upside risks. We see some downside risks from a rather subdued outlook for general economic development in the entire euro area. But as such, the main thing is that we do not see the situation of price stability in which we entered the euro area, and which prevails until this moment, would be in any way endangered in the future. That gave us the leeway to take the measure I have just announced. Question (translation): Mr. President, would you say you have admitted today that you are pursuing a business cycle-oriented monetary policy, which would constitute a change in model, compared with the Deutsche Bundesbank, which has always maintained that it does not pursue a business cycle-oriented monetary policy, but rather that ""we have a monetary target or a potential-oriented monetary policy, which is geared to the medium term"". Are you not facing the danger that such an obvious relaxation of your monetary policy could, instead of stimulating reform in other areas of fiscal, tax and labour market policy, reduce pressure for such reforms? With the greatest emphasis I am capable of, I want to deny that we have in any way switched our strategy or our approach to monetary policy. It is not a cyclically inspired policy. May I quote from my statement again; the interest rate decision "" has been taken in a forward-looking perspective focusing on the medium-term trends in inflation and the compatibility of these trends with the Eurosystem's definition of price stability."" That is something totally different from a ""konjunkturgetriebene Politik"". Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, this interest rate move has turned out to be unexpectedly large. Do you believe that you are now at the limit which you can justify in terms of stability policy and how long will this interest rate remain in place if economic activity in the euro zone does indeed pick up in the second half of the year? This is something we have, of course, considered in depth. We wanted the move to be as convincing as possible and we were afraid that a smaller move would only have led to further expectations for the future, that this would only be a first step in a series. We have by all means possible tried to avoid that impression. In very parochial words, I am inclined to say - and I cannot say ""do not quote me"" here, I realise that - but I am inclined to say that we moved from 3% to 2.5% which is maybe a slightly, unexpectedly large fall, but I would like to add, and now you be sure: this is it. We hope that the contrary will emerge over time. Convincing structural reforms relate to the following: We, and most other observers, are very convinced that the phenomenon of an unacceptably high rate of unemployment across the euro area, but particularly in the larger countries in the euro area, is due to structural factors and to inflexibility in markets for labour and in markets for goods and services and that monetary policy is neither the cause of that structural unemployment nor is it the solution to it. The solution to that problem has to be found in measures of a convincingly reformist nature in the labour and in the goods markets and we do hope that taking the monetary policy stance we have taken today will in the ensuing months increasingly focus the attention of policy-makers and the public on the real causes of the unemployment problem, because it will demonstrably become clear that monetary policy is not the answer to solve those problems. I will not allude to any opposition by anyone in the Governing Council. We do believe that this rate cut, otherwise we would not have done it, will not pose any additional threat of inflationary pressures arising either in small or in large counties. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, with regard to risks and side-effects. First question: will you keep the interest rate at 2.5% even if a recession occurs? Have we understood you correctly in this respect? Second, is it indeed so that too much capital flowing to the United States at high interest rates flows could become a problem for the external stability of the euro? I mean, the higher interest rates in the United States indicate that, at the moment, still more capital will be flowing to the United States. Third question: did you intend to increase the pressure on lenders, i.e. also on the banks, because your impression was that, in the light of the official rate of 3%, they were not answering borrowers' demands for cheaper loans? I am not going to speculate about a potential recession if we do not see one coming. We see a slowdown in economic development., We do not see, or do not yet see, a recession to be on our hands. So I will not speculate about what we would do if there really were a recession. We will cross that bridge when we come to it or, as my mother used to say: if the skies fall down, all the birds are dead. Interest rates in the United States are higher, but you have to realise that the United States is in a totally different phase of the cycle than we are and whether that will in any way induce capital flows to move differently from what they are moving today remains to be seen. And the third part of your question was, have we in any way made the conclusion that the banks, when the rate was 3 %, were not giving in enough to the demand for credit. No, on the contrary, as you know, the development of credit to the private sector has been quite buoyant over the past few months, although its bias of increase has come down somewhat. The last time I was here, I reported that credit to the private sector was growing at an annual rate of nearly 10%; the latest figure we have now is that it has come down to a rate of slightly over 9%. But then, when you analyse that credit to the private sector and its development, it is also very clear that those high rates of growth are particularly present in the smaller countries of Europe and not too much in the larger countries, although there is quite a difference between the various countries. So, in itself, that rate of growth of credit, which is already moderating somewhat, is not a cause of inflationary concern for us, and neither is the move today any inducement to the banks to be more forthcoming in giving credit. They are already quite forthcoming. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, the situation in Europe at the moment, especially this latest interest rate move by the ECB, now reminds me somewhat of Japan. You reduce interest rates time and again, yet on the other hand, no progress is being made in the areas of politics and restructuring in Europe. In December, although I cannot quote you directly, you stated, much in the same way as today, that following the cut in interest rates the situation with regard to interest rates in Europe would be settled. It is now the beginning of April and we see obviously a further cut in interest rates. Is there not the danger, Mr. Duisenberg, that this process is about to begin again and that, after a certain period, owing to a lack of willingness in Europe and in Germany, in particular, to bring about structural reforms, the whole rigmarole will begin once more and you will be forced, yet again, to cut interest rates? Well, we do not see that danger arising from the level which we now have reached. We hope that our call - as I expressed it today - to governments to pursue a reform-oriented policy, to adopt structural reform measures in all markets, that that policy will get a new incentive from the measures we have taken today. If they do not do that - and it will take time, I admit that before you can pursue and effect policies like I have in mind - if they do not do that, then indeed monetary policy is no alternative. Question (translation): Those who are not au fait with the intricacies of monetary policy, by that I mean Joe Soap , the man on the street, could get the impression that Oskar Lafontaine was right in making his demands. Has your decision anything to do with his resignation or could it be interpreted in another way, as a welcoming gift for the new Federal Minister of Finance in Bonn? The interest rates which we have established today are valid for the entire euro area and they have been founded on considerations related to the entire euro area and not to any particular country or finance minister. No, it is not part of the decision, but I do not have that much difficulty with your words. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, as yet, people do not have euro money in their hands. What is your message for Europeans in general with this interest rate cut? Well, I had ""Eurogeld in der Hand"" today. It looked quite good, as I told you. And my message to the people who will have euro money in their hands in two years time and who are already in the process today of getting used to it, more and more, as everybody can notice who travels around across Europe, the message I have is that, today's measures should increase the confidence of the people, of the ""Otto Normalverbraucher"" in the institution that manages their money, in the European Central Bank as the guardian of their values. No, it was not. It neither induced nor deterred us from taking the decisions we have taken today. Of course, we are fully aware of the dramatic turmoil that is taking place in Europe, and it does not leave us untouched, by no means, but we have also noted with gratitude that all this turmoil has so far not had any impact at all on the financial markets or exchange rates. "
04/03/1999,Duisenberg,"Let me start with the Governing Council's discussion on recent economic developments and the decisions that the Governing Council has taken today in the field of monetary policy. After a comprehensive and careful examination of recent trends and ongoing evaluations of the economic outlook for the euro area economy, there was consensus that some of the risks identified earlier, in particular with regard to real GDP growth, had materialised in the fourth quarter of 1998. There was also consensus that the impact of these developments on the balance of risks for price stability would need to be examined further in the context of the monetary policy strategy adopted by the Eurosystem. At this juncture, taking into account all the information available, the Governing Council confirmed its earlier assessment of the outlook for price stability. Against this background it decided that for the main refinancing operations to be settled on 10 and 17 March 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the previous one, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 4.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility will remain 2.0%. Let me report in some more detail on the Governing Council's deliberations, and thereby provide explanations for the decisions we took today. Starting with the monetary developments in the euro area at the start of Stage Three of EMU, the broad monetary aggregate M3 expanded at an annual rate of 5.7% in January 1999, against 4.5% in December 1998. This upturn was largely due to an acceleration in overnight deposits. This, in turn, may be explained by the low level of interest rates, which also contributed to credit to the private sector to accelerate further in January 1999 to 9,4% which is particularly notable as other indicators of the economy are signalling a slowdown in activity. Monthly data on monetary aggregates can be volatile. M3 growth is therefore monitored on the basis of three-month moving averages of the 12-month growth rate of M3, which stood at 4.9% in the period from November 1998 to January 1999. This was 0.2 percentage point higher than the figure recorded in the previous three-month period and is 0.4 percentage point above the reference value of 4½%. Against this background and in view of the uncertainty relating to special factors pertaining to the changeover to the Stage Three environment and the introduction of the euro, the Governing Council does not consider the acceleration of M3 at the start of Stage Three as a signal of future inflationary pressures. However, a close monitoring of monetary developments in the coming months remain necessary to give more conclusive evidence of the underlying causes and the permanent or temporary nature of the rise in M3 growth. Turning to financial indicators, euro area capital markets underwent a correction in February, which was mainly linked to spillovers from the United States and Japan. This followed a decline in long-term interest rates in January which had brought bond yields in the euro area to the lowest levels seen since the late 1940s. The euro area yield curve shifted upwards across the entire maturity spectrum during February. Let me also recall that the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro area in early March stood around 1% below its level on 1 February and around 4% below its starting level on 4 January 1999. At the same time, recent developments appear to have led to a reduction in some of the uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the world economy in 1999. This mainly relates to the strong performance of the US economy, but may also be due to signs of improvement in the real economies of some Asian. Nevertheless, in the view of the Governing Council, it is too early at present for a truly favourable assessment of the external environment for the euro area. Risks pertaining to external imbalances, continuing risk aversion and the corresponding weakness of private long-term capital flows and real investment to emerging market economies will need to be examined closely. In the euro area the latest indicators confirm that those risks which were identified earlier have now materialised to some extent. According to preliminary and incomplete data from national sources, real GDP growth in the euro area weakened in the fourth quarter of 1998 when compared with the previous quarter. While more precise estimates will soon become available from Eurostat, the evidence available suggests that activity in the euro area has been slowing down in recent months. This is particularly apparent in the production of themanufacturing sector, where output in the fourth quarter of 1998 fell by almost 1% compared with the previous quarter. These developments broadly confirm the pattern observed earlier in industrial confidence, which was on a declining trend in the second half of 1998. The latest data on industrial confidence in the euro area, i.e. those released by the European Commission today, indicate that industrial confidence has weakened further. Some recent wage developments in the euro area might have contributed to that. The level of unemployment has remained more or less unchanged over the past four months. Finally, consumer confidence in the euro area has remained unchanged from the high levels seen at the beginning of the year. With regard to capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector, which fell further in the fourth quarter of 1998, and retail sales, which up to November 1998 pointed towards broadly sustained growth, no new data are yet available. Overall, with regard to the cyclical situation, recent data confirm our earlier expectations that there are still downside risks for output growth. The Governing Council will continue its thorough analysis and very close monitoring of underlying trends and review its broad outlook for the euro area accordingly on an ongoing basis, taking into account in a forward-looking manner the impact of both domestic and external developments. With regard to the latest data on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the annual increase for January 1999 was 0.8%, which is unchanged compared with the previous two months (taking account of the most recent revisions). Looking at a breakdown of the HICP, a slight decline in the rate of increase in service prices (from 1.9% in December 1998 to 1.8% in January 1999) was offset by a slight increase in goods prices (from 0.1% to 0.2%). The fall in the rate of change in services prices was mainly due to lower price increases for transport and communications; this may have been a reflection of increased competition in these sectors. On the other hand, downward pressure from energy prices on goods prices diminished somewhat. On balance, the current data continue to suggest that there are no significant upward or downward pressures on prices in the short term. The pattern of risks to price stability has also remained broadly unchanged on balance. On the upward side, wage developments are a matter of concern, as would be any loosening of fiscal policies and the implications of this for achieving the objectives laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact. In addition, recent exchange rate trends need to be monitored closely also in terms of their impact on prices. Concerning downward risks, in particular the slowdown in the euro area economy is a cause for concern. In conclusion, taking the latest available evidence into account, at today's meeting the Governing Council confirmed its assessment regarding the outlook for price developments. The Governing Council therefore decided to keep ECB interest rates unchanged at the levels currently prevailing. I should now like to inform you about some other matters considered today. The auction technique for the longer-term refinancing operations was reviewed by the Governing Council today.In its first two longer-term refinancing operations (settled on 14 January and 25 February 1999), which are as a rule conducted by means of variable rate tenders, the Eurosystem applied the single rate (""Dutch"") method of allotment. The single rate method was chosen in order to encourage less experienced counterparties to participate in the tender. The Governing Council takes the view that all interested counterparties should by now be sufficiently accustomed to the longer-term refinancing operation also to be in a position to participate in this type of operation under the more market-oriented multiple rate (""American"") method of allotment. Against this background, the Governing Council has decided that the multiple rate method of allotment will be applied starting from the next longer-term refinancing operation (to be settled on 25 March 1999), until otherwise indicated. Finally, let me inform you that the General Council today discussed the monetary policies of the central banks of the non-participating Member States against the background of the monetary policy set by the Eurosystem. As you will know, the General Council has taken over those tasks of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) which still have to be performed during Stage Three because of the derogations of some Member States. One of these tasks relates to strengthening the co-ordination of the monetary policies in the Community with the aim of ensuring price stability. The General Council intends to conduct these co-ordination exercises biannually in future. We are now at your disposal should you have any questions. Question (translation): Mr. President, what, in your view, are the reasons for the weak euro? Is it due to the interest rate and business activity differentials vis-à-vis the United States, as is argued by some, or is it rather due to the political pressure brought to bear on the central bank, as argue others? We think it is predominantly the strength of the US dollar, rather than the weakness of the euro, which is determining the picture. And, of course, the interest rate differentials may also have something to do with that. We think those are the main factors explaining the recent decline in the value of the euro, which - if you look at the level which the euro has now reached - I would like to add is more or less the level which the D-Mark had during most of last year, and the strength with which the euro started life was more the exception than the rule. Yeah, we checked it today with them, and it was OK. Question (translation): A young currency requires political support. With regard to the interest rate differential, could part of the weakness be due to the fact that confidence has not yet been underscored politically to the extent needed? Yes, we are doing our utmost to underscore the confidence that the world has in this young form of money, the euro, and we would certainly hope that not only the ECB, but also politics would help us to the maximum extent possible in supporting this confidence-building process. Question (translation): Is the interest rate differential between the United States and Europe alone not an indication that calls for a reduction of official interest rates in Europe are simply wrong? I would not place it in that context. But what we are investigating is that there could be another related matter. Namely that the very strong increase in credit to the private sector has partly led or has been used to buy US dollar-denominated assets, attracted by the higher interest rates to be earned in the United States. And that by itself could have, let's say, financed the weakening of the euro or the strength of the dollar. But we are not yet quite sure about that. We will have to have more data available on capital flows and on where the credit is going to precisely, before we can come to any conclusions. But I am happy that you underscore the fact that interest rates in Europe are at an extremely low level, not only historically, but also compared with other major areas in the world. That, in itself, underscores that in the current cyclical situation monetary policy can definitely be regarded as having taken an accommodating stance. Duisenberg:We do not as yet have any indication whatsoever of that happening. Of course, as I said in my introduction, we will closely monitor, and keep monitoring, the exchange rate developments, also with a view to their impact on, or the impact they might have on prices, particularly through import prices. But , although I hate to mention individual countries, I do want to point out that Irish inflation is also still under 2%. The first question. Mr. Noyer has just returned from the Far East. So he has the best insight into world economic developments. On the second question, I can be very brief: our code of conduct is in the Treaty. It is forbidden for Members of the Board to have any employment, whether paid or unpaid, outside their functions as Members of the Executive Board. That is what the Treaty says. But that relates to employment and therefore also to income from any employment. I know that, in the Finnish case, there has been some particular scrutiny of certain pension rights. They fall entirely outside this matter. Noyer:On the other question, I am sorry I have no particular new information on China or Brazil. On Brazil, there is no new information, at least not as far as we know. China's situation might not be so clear: there are some new developments. But what is interesting in Asia is really that several countries that were hit by the first wave of difficulties, the ASEAN countries, are now moving upwards. If you take Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea, for instance, they are clearly countries in which reforms are being implemented and their economies seem to be gradually picking up. Perhaps this is less clear for other countries. It seems that, after all, there are good signs also coming from these regions, and from the emerging economies in general. So we still have to wait and see if this is confirmed, but there is not only bad news from an international point of view. May I also take this opportunity to say that it is clear that in these countries the rate of development in exports to European countries, as compared with the development of exports to the United States, has been roughly the same over the last two years. That is to say that, even if the US economy is seen to be more buoyant than that in Europe, one cannot say that the US economy has in fact helped these countries to recover more than the European economy, because the development of exports has been roughly the same over that period. With regard to Russia, I don't think there are new developments that are obvious for the time being. They are clearly in the process of discussing with the IMF. The countries I was speaking of are proving to be in a better shape, i.e. countries that had negotiated a programme with the IMF some time ago and that have implemented that programme, so that first results of this policy are appearing. This is quite satisfactory. Well, it does make the evaluation and the judgement more difficult, undoubtedly because developments in various parts of Euroland seem to be diverging somewhat. So it causes us to say what is of the least complexity to reach what we have to, our euro area-wide view on developments. Question (translation): The Greek Minister of Finance stated in an interview on Sunday that, where the rate of inflation in Greece is concerned, where its accession to Monetary Union is concerned, this criterion might be weakened. In that context, he referred to both the Commission in Brussels and the European Central Bank. He implied that these suggestions had come from both institutions. Is he right? We have, in the context of the General Council meeting I have just talked about, briefly discussed the issue without even trying to reach any conclusion. What is a fact is that in the future, when you have to judge a new entrant to the Euro zone, you will also have to make an assessment, as was done in the past, on the basis of the convergence criteria enumerated in the Treaty. Now, it is a factthat the Treaty was very precise in describing the criteria and how they had to be assessed in the first wave. The Treaty is a little less precise in describing exactly how to interpret the criteria in the case of additional countries joining a then already existing Euroland. For example, this particular Greek case, for which we have reached no conclusion. We will come back to that later on when - I am almost inclined to say when the time is right - when actual access to the euro area is about to be negotiated. Then we will come back to that. But - to mention just one example - one of the criteria was that the inflation rate should not deviate more than 1½ percentage points from the average rate of inflation of the three best-performing countries. Now, how do you interpret that in future, when you have an inflation rate for the euro area as a whole? Do you then look at the three best-performing countries? And, if so, do you look at eleven countries only or do you look at fifteen countries? Those are things to be discussed at the time when actual entry into the Euro zone becomes topical. It was just rumours. And they were not factual. Question (translation): A further question on the exchange rate. It has been said time and again that the exchange rate is also being ""talked down"" by politicians, not only by the economic data, by the spread between business activity and the interest rates, between Euroland and the United States. Mr. Stark, the Vice-President of the Bundesbank, has argued that someone in the political arena should say that a strong euro is favourable for the Monetary Union. Who should say that? Are you that someone or do you miss such a statement from the group of Finance Ministers? I will say that a stable euro is good for the Monetary Union. And I will say that, most of all, in the proper forum, for example at the forthcoming meetings of the Euro 11 group. That is what we want. I don't think so. Nor do I think that, if you compare today's statement with last month's, you will find a difference in tone. We still see risks, but we still see them both on the up side and on the down side. The first question on wage developments. Of course, the most recent ones we have become aware of were those in Germany. So, of course, in my statement we say that there is a potential risk involved. Not only a risk for prices. That, in particular, but also for growth and employment. So, of course, we have, in particular, those most recent wage developments in mind. Secondly, the phenomenon that the allotment percentage of the refinancing operations is very low and has even tended to become smaller, week after week, is a matter of concern. But the changeover for the longer-term refinancing operations has nothing to do with that. We will address this problem of a strong over-subscription to certain financing operations - which is there, in some countries more than in others - we will address those questions in the course of next weeks. I have said repeatedly that, within the broad range of indicators we monitor in order to determine our monetary policy strategy and decisions, the exchange rate is an important indicator, but only one. But it is an important one. And if we came to the judgement that the exchange rate developments are really seriously out of line with the economic fundamentals of the various large areas in the world - Europe and the United States - then we would probably react, but I cannot elaborate on that any more than I have done right now. Question (translation): Mr.Duisenberg, I have a question of a more general nature: How would you assess the European populace's sentiment today, two months from the introduction of the euro? Do you feel that you have made good progress along the road of gradually gaining the trust of European citizens and where do you see a need to improve your communications to strengthen that confidence? And will English remain the only language in the long run in which the ECB wishes to communicate with the population in Europe? Duisenberg:I believe we are well on the way. What we also try to measure across Europe is the confidence that the population at large has in the euro. The results of those efforts to measure the degree of confidence are becoming ever more positive not only in the euro area, but even in some of the ""out"" countries and I could think of no means with which we could publish more than we are already doing and with which we could give more speeches than we are already delivering. I think we are making the most extensive publication efforts both in the form of articles or notes to be published, of speeches being given intended for the public at large to inspire confidence in the euro and I would not know what to do, where to find the time to do even more than that. As to the second part of the question, we do communicate in all languages. All our official publications, that are the Annual Report, the Quarterly Report, are published in the 11 languages of the community. We even decided, which was not compulsory, to publish our Monthly Bulletin in 11 languages in Europe, and then I must say we often give speeches in 11 languages, to the extent that we are able to do that. We have carefully assessed that risk and we have come to the conclusion that there are no signs of deflation developing in the euro area as such at the moment. We do not think so and we will also discuss that in a thorough manner in the context of the forthcoming Euro 11 meetings. But then I would like to add that the yield curve has risen somewhat and has already become somewhat steeper over the past few weeks. I am aware that the Economic and Financial Committee held a two-day meeting earlier this week in which they discussed the stability programs of France, Germany and a few other countries on the basis of an analysis by the European Commission which has in the meantime been made public. It contains some critical remarks with which the ECB fully agreed. And - as on earlier occasions - we, and now also the European Commission, have expressed some concern about the determination of, in particular, the larger countries to adhere to the aims of the Stability and Growth Pact and that in itself has led us to say that one of the risks we see of the upward risks is a looser fiscal position which you will find in my Introductory Statement, if you read it carefully again. The weakening of the German economy which has been evident over the last quarter of 1998 could, of course, have an impact on its surrounding partners, including - as you asked so specifically - Eastern Europe. And it is for that reason that we do hope and very much encourage the German Government to remedy some of the weakening of the economy, whilst at the same time emphasising that such a weakening of the economy is not being caused by nor can it be remedied by monetary policy measures. But then you are ""hineininterpretierend"" in my statement in which I gave equal weight, I think, to the upward and the downward shifts which led to the conclusion not to change interest rates at all. That is correct. Yes, I am not concerned with the level that the euro has currently reached. I already put it against the background of the levels of the D-Mark during last year and it is not so much the level that is of some concern. If the movement were to continue, there could be cause for concern. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, the Federal Minister of Finance, Mr. Lafontaine, was your guest. Did he call for a ""reduction of the key interest rates"" as emphatically as he is doing in public or did he ""mumble"" about it, and what did you tell him? That was, yes, I believe that was two weeks ago, and I must confess that I have heard him louder through the media than in direct contact. No, I am aware that one minister has made some statements to that effect today. I do not share that concern. I do not see what it can have to do with the functioning of the euro. Not specifically to Germany, but we continuously give advice to point to the Ministers that the biggest problem they and we are facing in Europe is the unemployment problem. We keep explaining that the nature of that problem is predominantly of a structural nature, the lacking flexibility of markets, both labour and product markets, and that if governments can do anything they could tackle and, to our mind, they should tackle that cause of the unemployment in the first place. "
04/02/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. Let me start with the Governing Council's discussion on recent economic developments and the decisions that the Governing Council has taken today in the field of monetary policy. At today's meeting the Governing Council reviewed the latest monetary, financial and economic developments. After a careful examination of recent trends, in the context of its monetary policy strategy, it confirmed its earlier assessment that the outlook for price stability remains favourable. Therefore, it decided that for the main refinancing operations to be settled on 10 and 17 February 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the first such operations settled earlier this year, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility continues to be 4.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility remains 2.0%. Let me report in more detail on the Governing Council's deliberations and thereby provide the explanations for the decisions which were taken today. On 1 February 1999 we released the latest data on monetary developments in the euro area. These data confirmed the continuation of a favourable outlook for price stability in the euro area. The latest three-month moving average of annual M3 growth rates (covering the period from October to December 1998) was 4.7%. This result was unchanged from the average over the period from September to November 1998 and remained very close to the reference value for broad money growth of 4½% set by the Governing Council. Developments in the narrow aggregate M1 have been more buoyant recently. Similarly, the growth of credit to the private sector continued to be high in December 1998. These developments seem to reflect, in particular, the current low levels of interest rates in the euro area. Although they are not considered by the Governing Council to imply inflationary risks at this juncture, in particular the developments in credit growth will need to be carefully monitored in the coming months. With regard to the broadly based outlook for price developments and risks to price stability in the euro area, financial market indicators suggest that market participants continue to expect low inflation. Since early January, euro area long-term interest rates have continued to decline and the yield curve has shifted downwards. At the same time, the latest developments are giving mixed signals as to the evolution of the world economy in 1999. On the one hand, recent events in Brazil have highlighted the fragility of the current situation in emerging markets, while on the other, output growth in the United States was much stronger in the last quarter of 1998 than expected. In the euro area too, available indicators continue to suggest a mixed picture. According to revised Eurostat estimates, real GDP growth remained broadly robust in the third quarter of 1998, while in more recent months activity may have slowed down. Such a slowdown is apparent in industrial production growth up to November 1998, in particular in the intermediate goods sector, which is particularly sensitive to any deterioration in the external environment. However, at the same time, production of capital goods and consumer durables has continued to expand rather strongly. A similar pattern can be observed in the decline in industrial confidence that has been apparent in the second half of 1998 in the euro area, while, however, stabilising in January 1999. On the other hand, consumer confidence in the euro area continued to increase in December and in January; it has now exceeded the peak level reached in 1990, with retail sales up to November showing continued solid growth and car sales growing strongly during the last months of 1998. Finally, the mixed picture is confirmed by other data. Order books, which overall declined slightly further in December, apparently increased again in January, particularly with respect to export orders. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector, which started to decrease in the third quarter recovered again thereafter, while December data on unemployment appear to suggest that the decline in unemployment rates stalled around year-end. Therefore, with regard to the cyclical situation, recent data seem to confirm our earlier assessment that there are downside risks for output growth and that production may have slowed down around the turn of the year. Nonetheless, in the opinion of the Governing Council there are also no clear signals as yet of a stronger than expected weakening in output growth. Given the mixed picture outlined above, the Governing Council emphasised that further thorough analysis and very close monitoring of underlying trends are needed before any conclusions can be drawn concerning the broad outlook for 1999 and 2000. With regard to the latest data on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual increase for December 1998 showed a further slowdown to 0.8%, compared with 0.9% in November and 1.0% in October. This development was in line with previous trends; i.e. it was due mainly to a further reduction in energy prices and also, in December, to a decline in the price increases in non-energy industrial goods. Taking a forward-looking perspective, the general environment continues to suggest that there are no significant upward or downward pressures on prices in the short term. Furthermore, the pattern of risks to price stability has remained broadly unchanged. On the one hand, downward risks could materialise if import or producer prices were to fall further. On the other, given current wage demands, wage developments, especially when measured in real terms, could become a matter of concern and fiscal policies would also pose a threat to the favourable outlook for prices and growth and employment prospects, if the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact were undermined. In addition, exchange rate trends need to be monitored closely given their importance for domestic price developments. In conclusion, taking into account the latest evidence available, the Governing Council has not altered its assessment of the outlook for price developments. The Governing Council therefore decided to keep ECB interest rates unchanged at the levels currently prevailing. I should like to take this opportunity to recall that real three-month interest rates, if measured as nominal rates corrected for current HICP inflation (as a very incomplete proxy), stood at a level of 2.3% in January; this is approximately 80 basis points lower than the level one year ago. At the same time, real long-term interest rates, measured on a similar basis, have reached a level of 3.0%, which is around 110 basis points lower than in early 1998. These levels are very low, both in comparison with other countries and with historical data for the euro area. Monetary and financial conditions therefore support continued economic growth in the euro area in line with price stability. I should now like to inform you about some other matters considered by the Governing Council. The end-of-day procedures relating to TARGET and access to the Eurosystem's standing facilities were reviewed by Governing Council today. The Governing Council agreed that from tomorrow on the deadline for requesting access to the marginal lending facility will coincide with the deadline for access to the deposit facility, i.e. 30 minutes after the actual closing time of TARGET. Furthermore, the deadlines for requesting access to the Eurosystem's standing facilities will be postponed by an additional 30 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a minimum reserve maintenance period. As a final point, I should like to inform you that the ECB is planning an information campaign with regard to the launch of the euro banknotes on 1 January 2002. One of our aims in undertaking such an exercise will be to ensure that, by the time the euro banknotes become available, every person using and handling them will be fully acquainted with their features to the extent that everyone will be able to identify the banknotes as being genuine. In this respect, the ECB will be co-operating with the European Commission and the Member States to ensure that there will be no duplication of effort. We are now at your disposal should you have any questions. Duisenberg:That is because in practice the banks throughout the euro area still very much bunch their payment orders together at the very end of the day. That makes it difficult for them precisely to know what their liquidity situation will be overnight. It is only after they have finally bunched all their orders together very much towards the closing time of TARGET that they know precisely what liquidity needs or surpluses they may have. We have therefore given them an extra half hour, so as to make life easier for our counterparties and participants in the payment system to settle their accounts. When you look, in particular, at the causes of this consistent decline in the rate of increase of inflation, I have pointed repeatedly over the last months to the figures which were available for this. There was the fall in energy prices. In itself, we believe that to be a temporary factor. This persistent decline must come to an end at some point. And then, if we try to measure the underlying rate of inflation, the core rate of inflation - which is difficult, in the various countries it is somewhat easier to measure -, then you will come to considerably higher figures of price increases. If any... I do not know. Only if the euro were thought to be seriously out of line, in view of the fundamental factors, vis-à-vis other countries, might there be a need for a desirability of intervention, but I would not put a timeframe on it. At the moment it is certainly not the case. At the Banque de France last Friday, while major work was being executed on their system, there was a technical failure of a computer, actually a hard disk in the computer of the backup system literally broke. That caused a problem in the settlement in TARGET towards the end of Friday. It had the result that certain payments, large amounts of certain banks, could either not be paid or not be received, so that those institutions were compelled to take recourse to the lending or the deposit facility. It has been decided - the problems have in the meantime been overcome - it has been decided by the Governing Council today that those institutions which are said or claim to have suffered from this because they were forced to borrow at a higher rate than otherwise would have been the case will be compensated, in principle, by charging them the EONIA rate, the overnight interest rate, for the amounts concerned, and not the rate of the marginal lending facility. It will quickly be investigated by the Banque de France, in close consultation with the European Central Bank, to ensure a harmonised approach across the euro area-wide TARGET system. We expect that everything will be settled within one month's time. It is something I would not fundamentally oppose and it will come some day, but not yet. I cannot think of any factor that could undermine this strong currency. Question (translation): Mr. President, the G7 countries will be meeting on 20 February in Bonn and you have been invited to attend. Are there any special matters you as an observer would like this Conference to deal with in view of the still ongoing debate on a reform of the global financial system, a new architecture, and what points would you raise as being most urgent? I will participate in the G-7 meeting for certain agenda points. It is not yet entirely clear what will be on the agenda. Presumably we will talk about exchange rates and certain regimes that one could envisage for exchange rates. And, in that context, the ECB will not be in favour of any particular regime on exchange rates which could force it to put aside the primary objective which the ECB is pursuing, namely internal price stability. We have discussed the developments and we have concluded that the developments over the past few weeks in which the euro has moved from US$ 1.16 to US$ 1.13 today, that that is a matter of puzzlement. That is one thing we try to explain why it has happened. We can think of partial reasons, but also that it is not a matter of concern. We are also in a learning process. I mean these girations in the exchange rate, in the past, for the dollar, they have been very, very much larger than what we have seen now. And we also have to get used to the fact that the impact of exchange rate variations on the euro area as a whole is far less marked than in the past. The movements in the exchange rates would have an impact on the individual countries with exports representing only about 10% of the euro area as such. The euro area very much approaches the idea of a relatively closed economy. And so, well I often say it like this: if you ask a European ""what does the euro do"", he will answer: ""well, today it was US$ 1.13, yesterday it was US$ 1.14"". He will give you a precise answer. If you ask an American: ""what does the dollar do?"" The answer you will get: ""a dollar?"", ""a dollar is a dollar"". And we have to learn, I think, in Europe also to say more than we have done so far: ""a euro?, a euro is a euro"". I only see favourable effects, if the US economy were to remain that strong. But then we also realise that this indeed surprisingly strong performance of the US economy may, in part, be attributed to temporary factors. In the fourth quarter they had - although they have had some snow thereafter -exceptionally good weather in the United States which is favourable for output growth. One has to realise that some effects may also have come from the ending of the General Motors' strike and, by definition, these are temporary factors. So there are some temporary elements in this strong performance which we also take into account. But on the whole, the developments of the United States' economy in the fourth quarter have had and will have a favourable, positive impact also on developments in Europe. (Duisenberg:).Well I wouldn't like to engage in speculation, is the President's answer. And if I were to answer your questions, I would be engaging in speculation, so I won't. (Duisenberg:) No, I think I have given you a full and comprehensive view of what we discussed today. Well, on the last question, we are satisfied with the developments in the money market. And the transition to a truly integrated money market across the euro area has been rather swift and smooth. We are satisfied with that. On the interest rate moves of other countries, I cannot comment, with the exception that, as the Danish Governor told me, truly, it has become possible for the Danes to lower their official rates partly as a result of the successful launch of the euro. And the successful developments of the euro and in the euro area have certainly contributed to the success of the monetary policy in Denmark. Well, Mr. Noyer has participated in the discussion about Italy, and I am sure that he will not tell you anything about their discussion, despite the leaks that have come out of Brussels . Noyer: No, I think that is very much the responsibility of the Commission to make the proposal for the assessment of the stability programmes proposed by governments. The fact that we are invited to take part in the discussion will certainly not lead us to leak anything of what any assessment could have been. What we could simply say is that precise execution of the Stability and Growth Pact is an important element in the global assessment by the ECB of the balance of risks. If there was a development that would strongly deviate from the line in which governments have engaged themselves, our global assessment would have to take that into account, but we cannot say more today. Noyer: What I mean is simply that, for the time being, what we have taken into account for the foreseeable future, for the years to come, was the fact that governments have committed themselves to the Stability and Growth Pact. And this is an important element, taking a medium-term perspective of the likely developments in the euro area. Now, we of course consider that normally this should be implemented and that this factor is well known. But I don't want to comment further. There is no special new assessment that the ECB would like to give today about what are or are not the monetary stances of countries. And then you have to realise that the discussion which takes place about these things in the Economic and Financial Committee is not a discussion which itself would lead, or has to lead, to action. It is a discussion to prepare the ministers who will meet to discuss the same subject next Monday, and they will take action. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the end of the Press Conference. Thank you for coming. The next Press Conference will probably take place on 4 March, after the Council meeting. "
07/01/1999,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of the first meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. For the first time, the Governing Council took decisions of an operational nature in the context of the single monetary policy. On 1 January 1999 the euro was successfully launched. From that day onwards, the ""Eurosystem"" - that is, the ECB and the eleven national central banks of the Member States that participate in the euro - has assumed responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area with the primary objective of maintaining price stability. The Governing Council today expressed its satisfaction with the changeover to one integrated euro area money market in the initial days. Money market interest rate differentials across countries were significant only in the first few hours of 4 January 1999, but narrowed quickly thereafter, indicating that credit institutions were efficiently using arbitrage possibilities within the single money market. As you will recall, the Governing Council of the ECB decided at its previous meeting that the corridor established by the interest rates on the Eurosystem's standing facilities would, as a transitional measure, be kept narrow. This was achieved by setting the marginal lending rate and the deposit rate at 3.25% and 2.75% respectively, for the period of 4-21 January 1999. We observed a relatively large recourse by credit institutions to these facilities in the first few days of Stage Three. To some extent, this is not surprising since the spread between the Eurosystem's marginal lending facility and the overnight money market rate has been relatively small. As we noted after our last meeting, the measure of a narrow corridor is aimed at facilitating the transition to the new regime by market participants. However, we also noted then that over a longer period of time, such a measure would hamper the development of an efficiently functioning euro area money market. We therefore confirm our intention to terminate this transitional measure following the next meeting of the Governing Council on 21 January 1999. On 22 December 1998 the interest rate on the first main refinancing operation of the Eurosystem was set at 3.0%, with the intention to maintain this level for the foreseeable future. This first operation of the Eurosystem was successfully settled today. The decision on the amount of liquidity allocated to the banking system (EUR 75 billion) is aimed at providing sufficient liquidity to allow credit institutions, on aggregate, to neutralise their reserve deficit relatively soon within the first reserve maintenance period. It was taken on the basis of the liquidity conditions in the whole euro area money market, while paying due attention to the uncertainties related to the phasing-in of the new system. Let me now turn to the Governing Council's discussion on recent monetary, financial and economic developments and the decisions that the Governing Council has taken today in the field of monetary policy. At today's meeting, the Governing Council reviewed the latest data. The new pieces of information have not altered in any significant way the outlook for price developments. The Governing Council therefore decided that for the main refinancing operations to be announced on 11 and 18 January 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the first one, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. A separate press release has already been issued on these ECB interest rate decisions at 6.15 p.m. today. Furthermore, I should like to recall that the first longer-term refinancing operation will be announced on 12 January 1999 and settled on 14 January 1999. It will be conducted as a variable rate tender, using the single rate auction procedure. Let me report in some more detail on the Governing Council's regular assessment of monetary, financial and economic conditions, and thereby provide the explanations for our decisions of today. On 30 December 1998 we released to the public the first of the monthly statements on recent monetary developments in the euro area. The 12-month growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 decreased from 5.0% in October to 4.5% in November 1998. The latest three-month moving average of M3 growth (covering the months September to November 1998) was approximately 4.7%. This result was similar to the value estimated for the three-month period of August to October 1998 (which was revised upwards from the figure of 4.5% published on 14 December 1998) and remains very close to the reference value of 4 1/2% set by the Governing Council on 1 December 1998. With respect to the broadly based outlook for price developments and risks to price stability, financial market developments may be seen as indicating a favourable assessment of the recent monetary policy decisions of the Eurosystem, signalling that financial market participants expect the environment of price stability to continue. In this connection, I could mention the fall in long-term interest rates in the last couple of days to new historical lows and also the yield curve has shifted down. No major news has come in on the outlook for the euro area economy since we met last time. Hence, we continue to face uncertainties originating from the evolution of the world economy in 1999, which are reflected in a weakening of industrial confidence in the euro area over recent months. Also, euro area real GDP growth in the third quarter weakened when compared with the first half of 1998. On the other hand, consumer confidence remained high until late 1998. This mixed picture is also reflected in other indicators. Order books and capacity utilisation point to a less optimistic outlook, while retail sales and the recent pattern in employment and unemployment suggest more favourable trends. In general, this pattern of mixed evidence appears to characterise the economic situation in the euro area around the turn of the year and we shall continue to carefully monitor developments. With respect to the latest data on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual increase for November 1998 showed a further slowdown to 0.9%, compared with 1.0% in the two previous months. This development was in line with previous trends, i.e. it was mainly due to lower annual percentage changes in the prices of food and a further reduction in energy prices. On balance, the general environment continues to suggest that there is no significant upward or downward pressure on prices in the short term. The pattern of risks to price stability has remained broadly unchanged. On the one hand, downward pressures could materialise if import or producer prices were to fall further, while, on the other, wage developments would become a matter of concern if wage increases were higher than expected. In addition, any relaxation of fiscal policies would negatively affect the price climate as well as the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact. In conclusion, taking into account the latest evidence available, the Governing Council has not altered its assessment regarding the outlook for price developments. This is why, as I already mentioned, the Governing Council decided that for the two forthcoming main refinancing operations the same conditions will apply as for the first one, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. We also confirm our intention to maintain this rate for the foreseeable future. I should now like to inform you about the Governing Council's review of the changeover to the euro. First and foremost, I am happy to be in a position to report that, overall, the transition to the euro within the Eurosystem and the banking and financial industry has been accomplished to our satisfaction. With regard to the changeover weekend itself, the ECB informed you, by means of a first press release issued in the evening of 3 January 1999, that there had been no reports of any incidents that would have impaired the smooth start of the system. With regard to the first experiences of our operational existence, let me focus in particular on the performance of the TARGET system. Overall, during the first days of operation, the TARGET system has functioned well. TARGET has contributed substantially to the integration of the euro money market and it has made possible the consolidation of the treasury management of institutions with different activity centres throughout Europe. TARGET has handled more cross-border payments than anticipated in these early days of Monetary Union and, in doing so, has demonstrated its processing capacities. The problems which are being experienced in this initial period can be regarded as ""teething troubles""; after all, it is completely normal for operators - both in commercial banks and at the central bank level - to need some time to adapt to the system and to the new euro environment. In this respect, it is worth noting that more than 5,000 credit institutions are currently participating directly in TARGET. The value of cross-border transactions settled through TARGET already exceeded EUR 310 billion on the second operating day and this figure does not yet include domestic RTGS transactions, which themselves accounted for at least another EUR 660 billion. The total value of transactions settled was therefore almost EUR 1,000 billion. In addition to the news concerning TARGET, the ECB also informed you, by means of a press release on 5 January 1999, that its first refinancing operation - announced on 4 January 1999 - was completed successfully. Also here, the Governing Council obviously recognised that a learning process is still under way. The Governing Council will continue studying the best ways to adapt the liquidity provision to the changing conditions of this initial period. As a final point, as indicated at our press conference on 22 December 1998, the Governing Council today revisited the issue of front-loading euro banknotes and coins. The Governing Council holds the view that front-loading of euro banknotes and coins to the general public is excluded by Articles 10 and 11 of Council Regulation (EC) 974/98 on the introduction of the euro, since it would have the same effect as issuing or putting them into circulation. However, front-loading of euro banknotes and coins is considered legally possible to credit institutions and security carriers as well as to other organisations (e.g. retailers and vending companies) if, but only if, legal or contractual arrangements can be put in place in each national legal system in order to ensure that euro banknotes and coins will not be put into circulation prior to 1 January 2002. We stand ready to answer any questions you may have. Noyer: The main problems have not been technical ones, and they have not been problems linked to TARGET itself. They have been mainly problems linked to human factors, mainly in commercial banks. The cause might also have been some times in the central banking system, but mainly in commercial banks. Small errors made in addresses for payments or that sort of thing, so that the payment did not arrive at the exact time when it was deemed to be received by the receiver. That sort of problem, you know, developed in some cases, but - because of this - all problems identified have been repaired in a relatively short time. This is why we are rather confident. Of course, issues may appear that we have not yet discovered. But, for the time being, no failure or real difficulty in the system itself has appeared and all problems which appeared so far to have been solved in a relatively short time. And I want to emphasise once again that for today there were no problems whatsoever. Simply the amount of payments to be handled was so enormously large and is growing so fast that it was the larger banks in some countries which simply were not able to handle them in time. Duisenberg:I wasn't aware of that fact. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, over the past few days there have been a whole range of issues of government paper on the European capital market. How do you assess this wave of issuing activity? Is the reason to fear an increase in interest rates at the long end and is there not a need for a harmonisation of the issuing calendar in the 11 European countries? We have not discussed this today in the Governing Council, but on one thing - on interest rates - I would like to say that it is our impression that the way in which long-term interest rates, in particular, have developed over the last few days can be interpreted as an indication that inflationary expectations of the market remain very, very subdued indeed and that there are thus no expectations in the market of a change even in the longer term. Noyer:If I may add something. I suppose that you are referring to some issuing that has taken place this week, particularly in Germany and France. But this was related to a calendar established well in advance in both cases. On top of that, I know, we know, that Governments, Treasuries have discussed together sort of a harmonisation of calendars. Harmonisation is perhaps not the proper word, but they have exchanged their calendars what they foresee to issue, to avoid as far as possible to have a lot of issues on the same day. So this process is going on, but for the total amount the President has just answered that there is no reason to think that there is any change. We do not put a horizon to our future that we can see. Contrary to you, I come from a very flat country where we can always see the horizon which is very far there. So it certainly does not imply any date as you indicated that will be the end of our foreseeable future. As far as we can see, now we see no tendency which would force us to change interest rates in the future, as far as we can foresee it. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, the euro euphoria over the past few days must be satisfying to you, but is it not also reason for some concern because, in the long run, as you know, confidence in a currency is something that is difficult to build up. A second question: given that there is such euphoria, what must policy-makers do to ensure that such confidence is actually established? We as a central bank should continue to behave the way as we do, i.e. come up with clear and transparent decisions which gain the credibility and gain the confidence that we indeed will be successful in achieving our aim which is price stability over the medium term. What politics should do is also to continue to strive for a stability-oriented policy, particularly in the fiscal sphere, also in order to gain the confidence of the people and thereby to firmly establish this idea of euphoria, so that it becomes an idea which is settled in the minds of the people. It will no longer be euphoria, but it will be confidence and credibility that we are after. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, today there has been renewed calls for a stabilisation of exchange rates from Mr. Lafontaine in Brussels. Such calls have also been heard in Tokyo, and Mr. Chirac has likewise again spoken out in its favour. A meeting of the G7 countries has been scheduled to take place on 20 February in Bonn. Will you be participating in this meeting and what message and conviction will you express with respect to this issue? When I go to Bonn, and I will go, I will give the message to those who will listen there that we, as the central bank, are interested first and foremost in achieving our statutory aim, i.e. internal price stability. The exchange rate for the central bank is not an explicit aim. It is one of the indicators we will look at, at its development, together with a broad range of other indicators in determining our policy decisions. But then one cannot repeat often enough that the impact of the exchange rate on the domestic European economy is much less than we were used to in the fragmented markets when we were still eleven different markets with ten different exchange rate regimes. As you know, exports account for only 10 - 11% of the combined GDP and which makes the impact of exchange rate variations comparable to those in the United States or Japan. So, most of all, we are interested in stable internal prices and, secondary, we are also interested in a stable exchange rate development. But that is the outcome of policies rather than as the aim. I did not inform you about interventions, although I could easily mention a figure, the figure is zero, but then we do not have an exchange rate policy, we have a policy aimed at achieving price stability and we do not have an explicit exchange rate policy or exchange rate aim vis-à-vis other major currencies. That's about all I can say about that. I was happy when the euro took off with a very strong start. I was equally happy when yesterday the euro came down again somewhat vis-à-vis the dollar in the direction of the value it had right at the start of the conversion, and I'm equally happy today that again the euro rebounded somewhat to a level, when we left the bank, of USD 116.75. So I've been happy for three days already, and will that be as I said earlier. There will, of course, not be any neglect, neither malign neglect nor benign neglect, of the exchange rate. The exchange rate will be one of the indicators we closely watch in determining our monetary policy decisions, but only one of them. Structural problems and the problems which Mr. Noyer has just indicated, the problems that there were mainly the result of human errors and sometimes human ignorance. The operational personnel at the various commercial banking institutions has to get used to the new techniques, even to writing the new instructions to their computer, there sometimes they make mistakes which they will learn to avoid in the very near future, but which then cause hiccups in the smooth process of transferring these large payments from one country to another. So far it looks like there are no systemic problems with TARGET, TARGET is functioning extremely well. To be quite honest, the teething problems, or birth pangs, or whatever you may want to call them, were rather smaller than we had thought at some moment that they might emerge. We regard it as quite normal that there are these problems. If you suddenly switch over to a real-time gross settlement payment system cross-boarder which, as I indicated, already within three days turns out to be the largest in the world encompassing more than 5,000 credit institutions, it is no wonder that there may be some ripples in the water sometimes but that'll settle down. No, on the contrary, it is more or less the result of the banks, the banks' eagerness to be able to make more and more transfers even on this day, and they asked for that only in their own interest. I can assure you, this does not create more costs. Well, what can I do is a lot, but what I want to do is nothing. It's as simple as that. I mean, the same question was put to Mr. Greenspan a few weeks ago when we had this exchange here in Frankfurt, and Greenspan said, it's simply not feasible at the moment. Well, I'm inclined to listen carefully to what he says, and then to have a similar opinion. Christian, you're the gold man! Noyer: No, there is no such conclusion to draw, because it was not a decision to hold 15% of foreign exchange reserves in gold, as a structural decision of the Governing Council. The decision of the Governing Council at the time was that in the initial transfer 15% would be made of gold, but that has no consequence on the structure of foreign exchange reserve to develop in the future, nor has it any consequence on the total percentage of gold holdings of the system, including the reserves that are still in the balance sheet of national central banks, and we know that in some cases they have more than 15% gold, and in some cases they have less, but they are for the moment and for the foreseeable future keeping the proportion they have. And in this case, the foreseeable future is much longer than in the earlier case. This is for the first time that I give the answer which I announced I would give already on 31 December 1998, that is ""no comment"". No, it means very different things. In all countries, errors were being made, but they were of a minor nature, and I mean people also have the right to make errors. They were of a minor nature, only during two days it so happened that use was made of a rule that any single central bank can ask towards the closing time of the payment system for an extension of opening time by one hour. Now this extension in fact was asked for the first day and the second day. On the third day, yesterday, it was not asked. So yesterday everything already operated - I would not say normally, but at least within the limits set. Today again there was a request to extend it by 1/2 hour, due not, in this case, to any faults or errors in the system or the participating institutions but due to the enormous amount of payments that still had to be processed in order to be able to be processed within this single day. And the causes, well, they differ. It was simply making errors in the techniques, in some cases, also we think that the number of personnel that is engaged with executing these payments is not sufficient to handle this enormous amount of payments as it is developing. In a way today for example, as the experts at the bank said to me, what happens today is that TARGET is a victim of its own success. Effectively, there has been a considerable easing in the course of last year to the extent that the average three months rates have in the course of last year gone down by slightly more than 100 basis points, and one third of that easing has happened in the last month, in December. And for now, I think I would agree with you that there is no bias any longer in either direction. If I had expectations, I wouldn't tell you. Sorry, but when you talk to a central banker about exchange rates, always expect either no answer or expect a lie. I think you have asked everything which was important. "
