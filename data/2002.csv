2002-12-05,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. We continued our in-depth assessment of monetary, financial and economic developments and the discussions we had in early November on the appropriate stance of monetary policy, taking account of the new information. Overall, since our last meeting, the arguments in favour of a cut in the key ECB interest rates have strengthened. The evidence that inflationary pressures are easing has increased, owing in particular to the sluggish economic expansion. Furthermore, downside risks to economic growth have not vanished. As a result, the Governing Council has decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. At today's meeting, we also reviewed the reference value for monetary growth, which has an important role under the first pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council has decided to leave the current value unchanged at an annual growth rate of 4ï¿½% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the evidence continues to support the assumptions which have formed the basis of the derivation of the reference value since 1999, namely those relating to trend potential output growth of 2-2ï¿½% per annum and to a trend decline in M3 income velocity of ï¿½-1% per annum in the euro area. We will issue a separate press release this afternoon explaining in greater detail the background to this decision. When comparing current developments with the reference value, it is important to remember that the reference value is a medium-term concept. Short-term movements of M3 do not necessarily have implications for future price developments. Moreover, deviations of M3 from the reference value must be analysed in conjunction with other real and financial indicators in order to understand their implications for price stability. Turning to the most recent data, in the period from August to October 2002 the three-month average of the annual growth rate of M3 was 7.1%, unchanged from the previous three-month average. M3 growth has been influenced considerably by portfolio re-allocations in an environment of general uncertainty and particularly by stress in financial markets. At the same time, it also reflects the low level of interest rates in the euro area which makes the holding of liquid assets relatively attractive. There is ample liquidity in the euro area. However, in the light of the sluggish economic growth, it is unlikely that this excess liquidity will translate into inflationary pressures in the near future. The recent moderation of the growth in loans to the private sector, particularly to non-financial corporations, supports this assessment. Turning to the second pillar, recent information has strengthened the evidence of a decline in inflationary pressure. The sluggishness of real GDP growth in the euro area was confirmed yesterday by Eurostat's first estimate, which indicates that quarter-on-quarter growth was 0.3% in the third quarter. This was towards the lower end of expectations. Recent euro area-wide survey data suggest that overall sentiment in the economy remains lacklustre, with business confidence improving somewhat but consumer confidence falling further. It is expected, therefore, that economic growth will also remain subdued in the coming months. This disappointing picture mainly reflects the persistently high degree of uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions with potential consequences for oil prices, developments in financial markets, the sluggish growth of the world economy and the persistence of global imbalances are all factors that weigh adversely on confidence. These factors also have negative effects on euro area consumption, investment and the labour markets. As it is hard to predict when this uncertainty will start to abate, it must be taken into account in the more medium-term outlook for growth. The subdued economic activity should limit potential upward risks to price stability and help to ease inflationary pressure. Let me elaborate on this. First, when looking back, we recognise that inflation has been rather persistent despite the economic slowdown. This persistence has partly reflected a series of transitory developments, such as the indirect effect of previous oil and food price increases and a limited changeover effect. However, structural factors in the labour and product markets have also played a role, as mirrored, in particular, in the upward trend in wage developments observed until recently. This trend has only just shown signs of stabilisation. Services price inflation has also remained stubbornly high. Indeed, structural rigidities have impeded an appropriate adjustment of wages and prices. As a result, annual inflation rates have remained above 2% during most of 2002, including November, as has been confirmed by Eurostat's flash estimate, which indicates an annual HICP inflation rate of 2.2%. Second, when looking forward from now until the early part of 2003, although recent developments in oil prices have lowered short-term price pressures, there are still some factors that could keep annual inflation rates above 2% for several months to come. Yet this short-term outlook is related both to base effects and to indirect taxes and administered prices, i.e. to temporary developments. Third, when looking beyond the short term, we consider that both the overall economic environment and the euro exchange rate, which has strengthened since early this year, will contribute further towards reducing inflationary pressure. Moreover, we expect the indirect effects of previous increases in oil prices and other factors to further unwind. Although wage-related risks remain in place, they are judged less likely to materialise as long as the economic environment does not change substantially. The assessment which guided today's monetary policy decision was that, overall, the prospect has strengthened for inflation to fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and to remain in line with price stability thereafter. Our decision should also help to improve the outlook for the euro area economy by providing a counterweight to some of the existing downside risks to economic growth, thereby supporting confidence. The most likely scenario is that economic growth will gradually recover in the course of 2003 towards rates more in line with potential. Falling inflation should support real disposable income and, together with a reduction in the gap between perceived and actual inflation rates, should underpin private consumption. Moreover, we expect an improvement in world demand. This, and the low level of interest rates, should benefit investment. Let me point out that, with today's decision, the key ECB interest rates have reached a very low level by historical standards. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all factors that may affect the prospects for inflation in the euro area. The outlook for the euro area economy will also very much depend on visible progress in other policy areas. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, I would like to reiterate that budgetary discipline strengthens the conditions for sustainable growth of GDP and employment. Therefore, sound fiscal positions, as enshrined in the Treaty and further developed in the Stability and Growth Pact, are in the interest of all the Member States. Given the disappointing fiscal developments in some countries and the challenges which have emerged to the EU fiscal framework, we welcome the moves to correct or prevent excessive deficits, i.e. the implementation of excessive deficit procedures in the case of Germany and Portugal and the early warning issued to France. Countries with remaining imbalances are urged to prepare sufficiently ambitious consolidation plans for their forthcoming stability programmes. Emphasis should be placed on a growth-oriented consolidation policy that strengthens the productive forces of the economy. The Governing Council considers the recent Commission communication to be a good starting point for rebuilding confidence in the budgetary framework. As already reflected in the Statement on the Stability and Growth Pact of 24 October 2002, we fully support the Commission's main objective, namely to improve the implementation of the Pact within the existing framework of rules. Finally, I should like to stress again that there is still an urgent need to implement decisively the structural reform agenda. We note with some concern the slow progress in many euro area countries and call on governments to take determined action. The medium-term impact of these reforms on the economic growth potential of the euro area is likely to be substantial. A prompt implementation of structural reforms in the labour, product and financial markets is particularly important at this juncture since it would contribute to strengthening confidence in the euro area, thereby also supporting economic activity in the short term. We are now at your disposal for questions. ... I think the first question I would answer in the affirmative. We always have serious debates, but ... We weighed the pros and cons of a quarter versus half a point. And, in the end, there was – again – as usual, consensus that half a point was called for. Since 7 November there has not been any abatement of the uncertainty I would say, rather on the contrary, more uncertainty than ever. There has been increasing evidence of this. Also we now have available not only our forecast, which by the way we will publish next week, but also others. And these have also increased our concerns about the sluggishness of the economic growth performance. There have been, as I indicated in my statement, new survey indicators. There has been confirmation of our view, and maybe even for a few more months, that inflation will be – albeit temporarily – persistently over the 2% limit, but that it will come down. So, all those things have changed and also, if I may say honestly, if we had moved one month ago you would have been very surprised. Now I dare say you are less surprised than you would have been one month ago. Well, we hate using fixed formulas for certain situations, and despite the remarkable interpretation efforts by your colleague, Mr. Burckhardt, of every word and sentence that we say, well, as I said, we hate using fixed formulas, but we could have used the word ""appropriate"". It just slipped my mind, I must say. When the Governing Council decides that the rates will be such and such, they are – almost by definition – appropriate. We are aware of the comments made here and there and now and then about our two-pillar strategy. We have decided, in the course of next year, to come up with a serious evaluation, not necessarily a change, because we are still happy with our strategy. But we will make a serious assessment and evaluation of the monetary strategy in the course of, I think, the first half of next year. In our projections we do not see that shrink in the first quarter of next year, that is all I can say about it. And that is even more than I can say about the next question. There is a movement going on, which started in the second half of this year, of large foreign central banks increasingly holding their reserves in euro. But I can give you no figures at the moment, and the figures we have normally come from the IMF and, as you know, with great delay. So for us it is mainly individual and anecdotal evidence, which is solid, but which I cannot disclose. Sometimes we are. But sometimes not, and sometimes foreign central banks even make it public themselves. Yes. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, I would have two questions for you, if I may. First, the M3 expansion of 7% you said is not inflationary, but real. When is this expansion inflationary, because we have had this excess liquidity for almost a year now? Second question: did the ECB have a consensus view on the reform of the ECB's Governing Council once we have enlargement? The growth rate of M3 at its current magnitude, around 7% at an annual rate per three months or per month, would be a cause for concern if, at the same time, the economy was performing at or above its potential output growth rate. But because that is not the case, we do not have this concern. Then, on the second question, I am very sorry that I cannot inform you yet about the details, but it was a great achievement, I can assure you: today we have reached an agreement about the reform of the so-called ""voting modalities"" in the Governing Council in the event of a significant enlargement of the Governing Council. We need, however, I think a couple of weeks to translate this agreement, which was, as it had to be – and this is the only time that I will disclose voting behaviour – unanimous. We are unanimous in having reached a proposal for a recommendation, which we will make to the European Union Council for changing the voting modalities of the Governing Council. Basically, if you want, I can mention a few elements of it. We wanted the reform in case the Governing Council becomes too large and unwieldy to take decisions effectively and efficiently. We wanted to start from a few principles, that is, we wanted at all costs to preserve the principle of one man, one vote which we have at the moment in the Governing Council. We wanted the reform to be transparent, we wanted it to be robust. That is, we did not want to have to change the rules every time a new country enters the European Union. And then there was one other principle to which we also paid due respect, that is: if you have a Governing Council which comprises countries of very different size and you limit the voting frequency of individual members over time, then you would run the risk that decisions could be taken by a number of Governing Council members that would be, may I call it, unrepresentative for the euro area as a whole if you measure it by GDP or by population or however. And that was the most complex and difficult problem to solve. But we have solved it and it has led us to a solution where, basically, we will divide the total number of Governing Council members into three groups: one comprising the largest countries, a second group comprising one half of the total number of countries and the third group comprising the remainder. And the voting rights assigned to each group would differ. And then the last principle which we happily maintained is that there is only one group that has a permanent voting right, and that is the Executive Board. So no country, or no other person or member of the Governing Council will have a permanent voting right, but no country will be out of the vote forever. So that is covered at both ends. I am sorry to be so long, I wish I could tell you more, but to translate all this into a perfect legal text which stands, we need some time. But I expect that in, say, two or three weeks time, we will be able to make public and explain to you in full detail the fundamental agreement – which basically for us was a rather historical agreement – which we have reached. Well, as you know, monetary policy is in the first place inspired by future inflation developments and not so much by the economic weakness. It can help, but only marginally. Discouraged? No. Somewhat disappointed? Yes. But it is also explicable: part of the core inflation that remains stubbornly high is, in particular, the persistent rise in prices of services and that, in turn, is in part dependent on the fact that in Europe we have an internal market. But the market in services is still very much fragmented. And in trade in services, in contrast to trade in goods, competition across borders is governed less by official rules than by culture and unwritten rules, and is thus more limited. Therefore, where competition is less, prices may rise more. So, also there, we call for structural reforms. Sorry, I didn't say that it was dangerous in the near future. You must have misunderstood me. No. I said ample or excess liquidity present in the euro area does, in our view, not pose a threat to price stability because there is so much slack in the economy and I didn't put a time-limit on that. On your first question, I should have maybe added in the first place that our agreement also includes that the voting members should be the members of the Executive Board, of which there are 6, plus 15. That makes it 21. When does it start? When you add another three countries. So you do not start already with new procedures when only one country is being added, but at least three, and that brings you to 21. On voting I never answer questions, with the exception of on the voting modalities where we had to be unanimous, and I told you we were and are unanimous. On the interest rates, I said we had a good discussion, weighing not even the ""if"" of a cut but the ""how much""? 25 or 50 basis points, to be honest. And at the end of that discussion I concluded that the Governing Council had decided that interest rates would be cut by 50 basis points. And the Governing Council concurred when I concluded that. So that was enough. Now, on the room for manoeuvre I didn't answer the question. Maybe Market News International could repeat its question. Then I can repeat my answer. Yes, but I wouldn't speculate on any kind of shocks. We now have the key interest at 2.75% and that answers your question by itself, I would say. But it was not one of our considerations. Question (translation): The legal situation of Mr. Trichet is more uncertain than ever. Would it be legally possible that Mr. Noyer, the ex-Vice-President, would replace you at the head of the ECB? I know you said something on that yesterday, but could you explain this again? My answer is, well, in the first place when something is before the courts you do not comment. I don't comment and particularly not when it concerns such an esteemed colleague of mine. So, on the hypothetical question whether other people would be eligible for the job, I think it is wise not to go into that either. "
2002-11-07,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. We have reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments and updated our assessment in the light of the information available. In view of the high uncertainty on future growth, and its implication for medium-term inflationary developments, the Governing Council has discussed extensively the arguments for and against a cut in the key ECB interest rates. The view has prevailed to keep interest rates unchanged. However, the Governing Council will monitor closely the downside risks to economic growth in the euro area. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.1% in the period from July to September 2002, unchanged from the previous three-month average. The continuing strong expansion of M3 should be interpreted with caution, since it has been boosted considerably by high uncertainty in financial markets over recent months. At the same time, the low level of short-term interest rates continues to stimulate demand for the most liquid assets, which are included in the narrow aggregate M1. Loans to the private sector have stabilised at growth rates somewhat above 5%, a rate of expansion which, in real terms, is broadly in line with the long-term average. Considering all the evidence relating to the first pillar, from a medium-term perspective, more liquidity is available than would be needed to finance sustainable, non-inflationary growth. However, given the current economic environment, we do not see the risk of this translating into inflationary pressure in the near future. Concerning the second pillar, recent short-term conjunctural indicators and survey data suggest that real GDP in the euro area has continued to grow only moderately in the third quarter of this year. This is in contrast to earlier expectations that a more pronounced upswing would occur in the course of this year. Obviously, the hesitant pace of economic expansion and current, lacklustre confidence reflect the significant degree of uncertainty that has been building up over recent months. This uncertainty is associated with geopolitical tensions, the evolution of oil prices and developments in stock markets. However, for the time being, the main scenario for the euro area remains that economic growth is expected to return to rates close to potential in the course of 2003. In fact, this expectation is consistent with all forecasts published by international organisations. Private forecasters, on the whole, also seem to share the same view. Moreover, financial markets have shown signs of stabilisation in recent weeks following a period of considerable turbulence. The expectation of an improvement in economic activity in the euro area is contingent on a recovery of growth in private consumption, supported by a reduction in actual and perceived inflation rates. This expectation is also based on a projected gradual recovery of the world economy and export growth which, together with the low level of interest rates, should help to strengthen investment. Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding this scenario remains high. It is therefore very difficult, at this juncture, to predict the timing and strength of the economic upswing, both in the euro area and globally. Turning to recent price developments, in September annual HICP inflation was 2.1%. For October, Eurostat's flash estimate indicates an annual HICP inflation rate of 2.2%. This increase is again likely to reflect developments in energy prices, although no detailed information is available at present. Looking at price developments for the remainder of 2002 and the early part of next year, despite the recent decline in oil prices, some upward impact may occur reflecting base effects and country-specific developments – such as increases in indirect taxes or specific developments in services prices. Although difficult to anticipate, particularly due to the volatility of oil prices, a further increase in the annual rates of inflation around the turn of the year and a delay in the return to inflation rates below 2% cannot be ruled out. However, this further increase should only be temporary. Beyond the very short term, we consider that both the euro exchange rate, which has strengthened since early this year, and the overall economic environment are still contributing towards reducing inflationary pressure. Moreover, there should also be a further unwinding of the indirect effects of previous increases in oil prices and other factors that have added to the stickiness of the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding unprocessed food and energy prices. However, for inflation rates to fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and to remain in line with price stability thereafter, as indicated by recent forecasts, it is crucial that oil prices do not increase sharply again and that the upward trend in labour cost indicators observed in recent years does not continue. With regard to the latter, there seems to be notable inertia, despite the subdued economic expansion; therefore, vigilance is warranted. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, may I expressly refer you to the Governing Council's statement of Thursday, 24 October on the Stability and Growth Pact. There is a strong consensus within the Governing Council that the principle of budgetary discipline enshrined in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact are indispensable for Economic and Monetary Union and that the Stability and Growth Pact has been successful in promoting sound public finances and fiscal convergence, as well as in supporting the return to price stability. Moreover, the Pact is in the interest of the Member States. May I also again urge governments to implement decisively the structural reform agenda, both within the area of fiscal expenditures and revenues and in labour and product markets. Such action is needed to enhance potential output growth over the medium term. At the same time, the prompt implementation of structural reforms would contribute towards strengthening confidence in the euro area and thereby support economic growth in the short term. We are now at your disposal for questions. Let me answer the last question first. If we had done something with interest rates, either earlier or today, the same people would have lost their jobs as well, because monetary policy cannot give such an incentive to either employment, in this case, or economic growth, at least not in the short term. And so, I believe your question should be raised in other circles. As far as the first question is concerned, I think I have just described the discussions, and I point to the words I have chosen. We discussed extensively the arguments for and against a cut – and I say a cut, not a change, in the key ECB interest rates – but, in the end, the view has prevailed that it would be wise to keep interest rates unchanged, as we have done. The fact that the Fed changed rates yesterday was not much of a surprise, though I was somewhat surprised by the magnitude. But the uncertainty quoted by the Fed in its Communiqué is the same as the uncertainty we feel. It has very much to do, as I said, with the geopolitical situation and the uncertainty surrounding future developments of oil prices. So, the climate is one of high uncertainty and there, I believe, the assessment made by the FOMC is very similar to the assessment made by the Governing Council. As regards voting, you know I never say anything. I believe it is enough what I have said, that, after an extensive discussion, the view prevailed that we would be well advised to leave interest rates unchanged today. That decision is of course carried by the entire Governing Council. I do not know yet what we will say in the future. That depends on the circumstances in the future, but it is true that you have never heard me say that before. You have heard it for the first time today. What I will do in the future is up to the future. Not a permanent change. But, you are right, it is a change. This is certainly not the first time we have taken into account the prospects for growth: we do so every time in every discussion because, after all, it is the secondary objective of the ECB, the first being price stability. Subject to price stability not being threatened, the ECB should help promote achieving the economic goals of the European Union at large; and those goals are economic growth, employment, as referred to in Article 2 of the Treaty. It means what it said. There is simply a strong consensus. We do not take a vote, certainly not on that. I cannot say anything more than that. And I cannot answer the question about quantifying the strength of the political factors in play. We have a clear, forward-looking and medium-term oriented strategy based on two pillars. Those are the factors we take into account when coming to decisions, not pressure from politics, markets or even you. That is a very hypothetical question. If we were to stick to rules like the ""Taylor rule"", what would you do then? Well, we do not stick to rules like the ""Taylor rule"", so I prefer not to speculate. We have a two-pillar strategy, and in the light of that two-pillar strategy we have come to the decision that we have taken today, as I have amply explained. The rate of growth of M3 hovering consistently around or above 7%, considerably higher than the 4.5% reference value, can be explained partly, but not wholly. Partly, because there is a notable preference for holding liquid assets and for portfolio shifts occurring in the light of the uncertainties in the financial markets. But then we have to explain the rest, so to speak, of the differential with the reference value, which, in itself, we do not question. We have to explain the rest of the differential against the background of the economic circumstances. And, as I have said, with this very slow, moderate, sticky pace of recovery and the below-potential performance of the economy, we do not see, from the liquidity available, the M3 figures, a threat to inflation. As to reforming the Governing Council, we continue to discuss it. We hope to be able to come up with a proposal shortly, as the Heads of State have asked us to do as soon as possible after the ratification of the Nice Treaty. We are working hard on that. On the particular aspect of taking monetary policy decisions by a – let me call it – simple majority, which, in the future, could give rise to a situation where the monetary policy decision is taken by a group in the Governing Council, which, by the way, includes the Executive Board, which could be regarded as not representing the major part or the most important part of the European Union or the euro area. We do take this into account in our preparations for formulating a proposal. So, on the one hand, we are very keen on and agree to maintaining the so-called ""one man, one vote"" principle. On the other hand, we are looking for a mechanism – and we think we have already found it – to also take into account the ""degree of representativeness"" in the vote of the Governing Council. So the problem you signal is indeed there, but the solution, I think, we will have at hand. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, two questions on the two pillars. You have been explaining M3 expansion for almost one month now by the uncertainties in the financial markets. Second, if you are discussing a reduction in interest rates then I suppose that the second pillar becomes more important than the first. Does this mean – if I understand you correctly – that the projections, maybe next year, will show a) that the trend growth rate cannot be achieved; and b) that you still hope that the inflation rate will drop below 2%? Would that be the basis for your discussion in the next round? Duisenberg (translation): Well, may be for the next round. But, of course, as yet we do not know the projections for next year. We will have these figures in December. People are still working hard to get them ready. I will tell you what that mechanism is as soon as we have finalised and formulated the proposal. But we are working on formulating a proposal, taking into account a variety of principles. I already mentioned ""one man, one vote"", I mentioned the degree of representativeness, I could also mention the fact that the proposal has to be transparent, to be easily understood. It has to be robust. It cannot be that whenever a new country joins the European Union you have to change the rules of the game again. Given all these sometimes complex principles which we take as the starting-point, it is very difficult to fulfil the requirements of another principle, that is transparency. And we also want continuity, we now have a track record of decision-making of almost five years, and it has, in our feeling been a success, that process of decision-making and we want continuity of that process. Formulating a proposal is, I can assure you, a very complicated task and it is even more complicated to present the proposal in a way which will be perceived as simple and straight-forward and I cannot, at this stage, take one element out of it and present it independently. You have to, I am afraid, wait for and look at the proposal in the whole context in which it is made. First of all, I have not seen that letter, so I cannot speculate on what I would answer had I seen it. But do I feel orthodox? The answer is no. I feel confident and I hope I will be perceived as being credible. If you want to call that orthodoxy, then I do not mind. Not on average. We have forecasts, the old ones, the new ones, as I just said, are still under preparation. We have surveys, but they sometimes give, admittedly, conflicting signals. On industrial production, the survey is rather positive, on consumer confidence the survey is much more, as I would call it, lacklustre, and there is not much movement there. Then we have the expectation that inflation will come down to below 2%, we think it will happen. But of course we are taking into account the fact – and are disappointed by the fact – that it will come later than we originally anticipated. But if and when inflation comes down – and do not forget I also added the word ""perceived inflation"", which, at the moment, is considerably higher than actual inflation and we do regard that as a temporary phenomenon – if and when inflation comes down, it will give a boost to real disposable incomes and thereby support, in particular, private consumption. Well I would say the same, I think, as the politicians concerned, that is, in the words of Queen Victoria: ""I am not amused."" Well, you would have to be a psychiatrist, because what you are actually asking is: to what extent did it have an impact on the minds of the individual members of the Governing Council. Certainly, it is a factor we perceive. But then let me say that the utterances and the discussions about the Stability and Growth Pact are very much a thing, I believe, of the past–, of the very recent past. I was very pleased when I attended the Eurogroup finance ministers' meeting to observe the determination of the ministers to uphold the Stability and Growth Pact and to stop talking about it. We revealed today that we discussed it to indicate that we indeed had an in-depth discussion and we weighed all the pros and cons of today's decision. It says nothing about the size nor the moment of a rate cut, I say again, sometime in the future. "
2002-10-10,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Today, the Governing Council continued its in-depth examination of monetary, financial and economic developments, incorporating in its assessment the new evidence that has become available over recent weeks. Our conclusion is that risks to price stability are at present balanced. Based on our overall assessment, we have kept the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.1% in the period from June to August 2002, compared with 7.3% in the period from May to July 2002. Hence, monetary growth remained strong and liquidity in the euro area ample. Recent monetary developments, however, should be interpreted with care. On the one hand, monetary trends have been influenced by considerable uncertainty in financial markets and therefore partly reflect strong liquidity preferences among investors. On the other hand, the low level of short-term interest rates has tended to stimulate monetary expansion, reflected particularly in the increase in the narrow aggregate M1. At the same time, loans to the private sector appear to be stabilising at growth rates above 5%, a rate of expansion which, in real terms, is in line with the long-term average. Considering all the evidence relating to the first pillar, from a medium-term perspective, more liquidity is available than would be needed to finance sustainable, non-inflationary growth. However, given the current environment, we do not see the risk of this translating into inflationary pressure in the near future. Concerning the second pillar, the latest data and survey results confirm that economic activity in the euro area remains subdued. These data and results also suggest that real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2002 may turn out to be similar to that of the first two quarters, when quarter-on-quarter expansion reached 0.4%. Against this background, previous expectations of an acceleration in economic growth in 2002 will not materialise. At the same time, a significant degree of uncertainty has been building up over recent months owing, in particular, to the sharp decline in stock prices and their potential detrimental effects on the economy, as well as to geopolitical tensions as reflected in surging oil prices. Nevertheless, the main scenario for the euro area is a return, in the course of 2003, to economic growth rates in line with those of potential, as also reflected in forecasts by international organisations. However, the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is high. Sources of downside risks – including oil prices, imbalances in the global economy, financial market uncertainties and their impact on consumption, investment, and thus on employment – will be monitored closely. At this juncture, it is particularly difficult to offer a precise assessment of the timing and strength of the economic upswing, both in the euro area and globally. Turning to price developments, in August annual HICP inflation was 2.1%. Eurostat's flash estimate for September indicates an annual HICP inflation rate of 2.2%. While no detailed information is as yet available for individual HICP sub-components, the recent increase is likely to reflect the rise in energy prices. These developments generally remain in line with previous expectations of inflation rates hovering at around 2% for the remainder of the year, but short-term trends could be affected by future oil price developments. Looking further ahead, the euro exchange rate, which has strengthened since early this year, and the overall economic environment should contribute towards reducing inflationary pressure. In addition, we expect rates of perceived inflation, which are currently high, to move closer to actual rates. However, the assessment that inflation rates will fall and remain below 2%, depends on the development of oil prices and the prevalence of wage moderation. In this respect, earlier this year we pointed to an upward trend in wage growth which, according to preliminary indications, may have come to a halt only recently. In the same vein we have noted the inertia of consumer price developments in the euro area, as reflected in the stubbornness of the annual rate of inflation excluding unprocessed food and energy. This rate was 2.5% in August, only marginally lower than early this year; therefore, vigilance is warranted. Overall, monetary policy will remain geared towards maintaining price stability and will continue to focus on the medium term, thereby providing a reliable anchor for consumers and investors. At the current juncture, aggregate demand and exchange rate developments should contribute towards easing inflationary pressure, while monetary developments, wage trends and oil price developments could point to risks in the opposite direction. Consequently, all factors which could influence the balance of risk to price stability will be monitored closely. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, the Governing Council notes with concern that there is still insufficient ambition in some countries to bring budgets to positions close to balance or in surplus over the medium term. The current fiscal problems in some countries arise from the fact that these countries did not take the opportunity to improve substantially on their fiscal positions when economic growth rates were considerably higher than is currently the case. Given that this opportunity was missed, there is now no alternative but for all countries with remaining imbalances to make firm commitments to avoid excessive deficits, in keeping with the Treaty provisions, and to attain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus, as required under the Stability and Growth Pact. Swift, decisive action is necessary in order to set up credible adjustment paths based both on realistic assumptions on the economic environment and on well-specified consolidation measures. Such adjustment paths must entail significant yearly improvements in the cyclically adjusted budget balance, and must be followed strictly and be completed within the shortest possible time-frame. To underpin this process, the ECB calls for strict monitoring procedures for the implementation of the consolidation strategies, the full use of the excessive deficit procedure and the application of rigorous accounting rules. Fiscal consolidation is not detrimental to the outlook for economic growth. The attainment of budgetary positions in line with the Stability and Growth Pact will gradually create scope for dealing with ageing-related issues and their impact on public finances. In any case, in the short term, the Pact does not place constraints on those member countries already in compliance, although it does call for the transition to be completed in the few remaining countries. Direct effects on short-term demand are to be counteracted by higher credibility of the conduct of fiscal policy – boosting confidence and thus private spending. We also urge governments to overcome the inertia in implementing structural reforms, both within the area of fiscal expenditures and revenues and in labour and product markets. Any further delay in tackling, with greater determination, the underlying reasons for limited growth in potential output over the medium term, and for only partially exploiting the current potential, is costly. It would also make it increasingly difficult to reach the objectives set in the Lisbon Agenda. Structural reforms take time to unfold fully their benefits and should therefore be frontloaded. Under the current circumstances, frontloading is particularly needed as it would support confidence. We are now at your disposal for questions. My answer to the first question is ""yes"". Yes, I say ""yes"" again... and they should start as soon as possible. But in the statement issued by the Ministers, together with us, it says ""at least one-half percent"". First of all, on the – may I call it – ""robustness"" of financial institutions, generally speaking in Europe they are robust. I don't say that they don't get hurt by what is happening in markets, especially in equity markets, but they can stand some headwind. Their capital position is generally very robust, so, is it a cause for concern? The answer is no. The second question was about what I said in the Parliament, and that I can repeat here. The main problem plaguing our economies both here and across the Atlantic is the combination of uncertainties prevailing and confidence lacking. I believe the authorities, both the monetary and fiscal authorities, can contribute towards eliminating the uncertainties and boosting confidence by following a steady line by inspiring confidence through their steady, determined following of the policies, as they should do. I think that it is the best contribution under the current circumstances that the policy-making authorities can make. Well, I pointed out in my introductory statement that there are still risks but the risks are balanced. There are upside and downside risks to our primary objective. And then maybe I can briefly answer your question that, contrary to what you suggested, the word ""appropriate"" was not used in my introductory statement today. Of course they are. Otherwise we would have changed them. Well, I first of all deny, and I deny explicitly, that monetary policy is tight. I pointed to the ample liquidity conditions, I pointed to the low level of interest rates prevailing already and I am, of course, in charge of taking responsibility for whatever we do, and I am fully prepared to do so. You should not only look at the nominal level of interest rates but also at the real level of interest rates. The real level both of short-term and long-term interest rates is lower than it has been over the past 40 years. So, monetary policy and the monetary policy stance are in no way a hindrance to the resumption of economic growth. The impact of stock prices has in itself indeed been rather dramatic. But as I said in answer to an earlier question, generally speaking, the banks and the financial institutions can weather a storm very well because of their sound, robust, underlying position. As I said in my introduction with regard to loans to the private sector, I also hear the noises about a credit crunch. As far as we can analyse it – and we do, of course – we see no signs of a credit crunch prevailing. This is evidenced by the fact that – and this is euro area-wide, admittedly – growth in loans to the private sector is exceeding 5% at an annual rate, which is in line with the historical average for this factor. And we do hear the noises, we do not know precisely what the credit to the private sector is being used for or where it goes, but we see no signs for the euro area as a whole of a credit crunch in the sense you mentioned. We do not believe this by any means. All these accession countries are in a process of transition and approaching the economic performance of the average of the euro area. They are not yet there, but you have to distinguish between membership of the European Union and membership of the European Monetary Union, the adoption of the euro. And that is still a long time off. And so we see no danger. As one of my colleagues, actually my successor in the Netherlands, said to me yesterday evening, you have to realise that the combined GDP of the ten accession countries we are talking about is smaller than that of the Netherlands alone. I also said, if you wish to keep on quoting me, that a steady hand in monetary policy provides a stable anchor for consumers and investors. They know what we are doing, they trust what we are doing and that in itself already helps confidence to be restored. I think all previous rate cuts have proven to be appropriate in the given circumstances. And so our decision today not to cut rates is equally appropriate and is based on experience, and we learn from experience. I will not comment on individual countries here. The task of doing what you ask rests with the Commission, and in the past and, you can be sure, in the future, we will be squarely behind the Commission in its judgement. And that includes the statements made by the ministers – I should say by all but one minister – and the ECB that the adjustment has to start as soon as possible, that is, in 2003, to be precise. The answer to the first question is very brief. That is no. To the second question, the discussions about the future structure of supervision and regulation of banking and insurance and pension funds are still in full swing and we are fully involved in those discussions. Our position is that not only the ECB but also national central banks should be involved in all layers of the structure to the maximum extent possible or feasible. But the discussion isn't over yet. Well, let's tackle the last question first. You have to distinguish between the structural deficit and the structural measures underlying the budget position and the cyclically caused deviations from the desired path. And what we are saying is, it's much more important for growth and confidence-inspiring if governments follow their pre-announced target of reducing their deficits, structurally, that is, in the direction of a position of a balanced budget or even in surplus. That is confidence-inspiring, especially also in times when the economy or economic developments are weak or weaker than anticipated. Don't forget that out of the twelve euro area countries, eight have already achieved the goal that they agreed on when they concluded the Stability and Growth Pact in Dublin. Eight have already achieved it. They have full room to let the automatic stabilisers work and they are doing that and they are using that room. But, admittedly, the other four countries have less room to let that happen and that's why it is so disappointing that they didn't create the room at a stage when they had ample opportunity to do so. Now, if outsiders, sometimes also central bankers, say we have to act more quickly and swiftly and be more determined to cut rates in the current situation, then I would like to point out that we base our monetary policy decisions on a thorough analysis of both monetary developments and a wide range of indicators related to the real and the nominal economy. And the end result of that analysis is what, for us, is crucial in determining whether or not to change the monetary policy stance. And I refer to one piece of advice in particular that we have recently been given – of which you will be well aware – that is from the Managing Director of the IMF, who had the thesis that monetary policy is, in a time of economic headwind, as we are going through now, the first line of defence. I must confess that I asked him, both publicly and privately, since when is monetary policy the first line of defence? And as I confirmed in Parliament also, I am still awaiting the answer. Very strong. Well, as you know, our policy line is that we, as I always say, hate deflation as much as we hate inflation. That is one thing. We see no signs of deflation emerging. There are two countries with inflation rates close to 1%, i.e. Germany and Belgium. But we also see no signs in these countries that this development might ""degenerate"", so to say, in the direction of deflation. The latest indications are that even in Germany the inflation rate is not falling further; it may even be creeping up somewhat but it remains very, very low indeed. Well, I am rather happy that you ask about my ""Leidenschaft"" [passion]. I think you are right, I have put more emphasis on it today than I have done on previous occasions. But that is also a reaction to the events of the past couple of weeks, in particular what happened this week in Brussels. So we strongly support the European Commission in its actions as guardian of the Stability and Growth Pact. If that sounds like ""Leidenschaft"", then at least it shows that even central bankers can have emotions. And the second question was, at a time when the cycle is not as benign as we would want it to be, what is the task of monetary policy? That depends on our strategy and on our mandate, on what monetary policy can do. But then I am also saying, do not ask for monetary policy to perform tricks it cannot do. And, at the current juncture, what you can and should most expect from a central bank is that it does its utmost to inspire or re-inspire confidence amongst consumers and investors. We should at least keep our promise – the promise we made in our mandate – to deliver stable prices, and that is what we are doing. I would be inclined to say that I have answered that question already – not when Mr. Sims asked it, but when you asked it. I can repeat the words I used in my introductory statement. There it said: ""Our conclusion is that risks to price stability are at present balanced. Based on our overall assessment we have kept the key ECB interest rates unchanged."" Now, if you take the explanatory bible which has recently been published by the Börsen-Zeitung and put the two statements together, then you can draw your own conclusions. "
2002-09-12,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Mr. Christodoulakis, and Commissioner Solbes. At today's meeting, the Governing Council continued its comprehensive examination of monetary, financial and economic developments and assessed new evidence that has become available over the past few weeks. Our conclusion is that risks to price stability appear rather balanced. Against this background, the current level of key ECB interest rates is appropriate. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.3% in the period from May to July 2002, compared with 7.4% in the period from April to June 2002. Hence, there is no indication of a significant reduction in monetary growth over the last few months. The recent strength in M3 growth partly reflects both the low opportunity cost of holding money and renewed portfolio shifts into M3 in an environment of financial market uncertainty. In this context, monetary trends need to be assessed with caution. From a longer-term perspective, there is concern that more liquidity is available in the euro area than would be needed to finance sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. However, at this juncture, there is less risk that excess liquidity will translate into inflationary pressure, given the environment of subdued demand. The trend in the growth of loans to the private sector also seems to point in this direction. Concerning the second pillar, the latest data confirm a modest recovery in real GDP growth in the euro area in the first half of this year. In the second quarter of this year real GDP growth is estimated to have grown by 0.3% quarter on quarter, following upwardly revised growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. In contrast to the first quarter, developments in demand appear to have been more broadly based, as activity was supported by private consumption, export growth and inventories. However, overall domestic demand growth remained subdued as a result of the protracted weakness of investment. Looking ahead, the most likely scenario is that of ongoing, albeit modest, growth in real GDP in the second half of this year, with growth rates in line with potential growth in 2003. This delay in the acceleration of economic activity in the euro area broadly corresponds with the world economic outlook, given that the expected pace of the recovery has been scaled down over recent months. Sharp declines in stock prices are having negative effects on consumer and investor confidence. Consequently, the strength of the upturn in economic activity has become more uncertain, both inside and outside the euro area. At the same time, however, the conditions for a stronger economic recovery in the euro area remain in place. On the domestic side, private consumption should particularly benefit from lower inflation and improved real disposable income, while investment should be supported by low nominal and real market interest rates. Finally, the gradual recovery of the global economy is also expected to continue. Nevertheless, risks to the economic outlook, both inside and outside the euro area, need to be monitored closely. Turning to price developments, in July annual HICP inflation was 1.9%, while the inflation rate excluding unprocessed food and energy fell slightly to 2.5%, its first decline in 2002. Eurostat's flash estimate for August, which indicates that annual HICP inflation increased to 2.1%, is fully in line with previous expectations that inflation rates were likely to fluctuate at around 2% for the remainder of the year. However, the short-term trend is also dependent on oil price developments, which have increased significantly over recent months. Looking further ahead, the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate, as well as the overall economic environment, should contribute to a reduction in consumer price inflation. Moreover, services price inflation is expected to moderate somewhat, following particularly strong increases in 2002. However, for inflation rates to come down to levels below 2% in 2003, as currently projected by most forecasts, it is crucial that oil prices do not escalate and that wage moderation prevails. With respect to nominal wage growth, we have already noted an upward trend over recent years, which continued even when the economy started to slow down. While the information from the latest wage indicators does not signal a further acceleration, wage developments remain a cause for concern, despite the weak cyclical situation. With regard to the devastating floods which have hit three member countries in particular, we deeply regret the substantial loss of life. The overall macroeconomic impact of these floods should be limited and have no lasting effects. Certain food prices could temporarily rise as a result, also due to bad weather conditions in other euro area countries, and while real GDP growth could initially be dampened slightly it may subsequently be stimulated by reconstruction. Overall, subdued aggregate demand and the strengthening of the euro should contribute to lower inflationary pressure. At the same time, other factors – in particular monetary developments, but also wage trends and oil price developments – might pose risks to price stability in the medium term and therefore need to be monitored closely. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, flood-related costs should lead to a review of priorities and a reallocation of expenditure. In addition, against the background of recent developments, it seems to be more warranted than ever to call on member countries to remain committed to the Stability and Growth Pact. Countries with sound fiscal positions should safeguard their achievements, while countries with remaining imbalances must avoid deficits in excess of 3% of GDP and implement determined policies in order to progress towards budgets close to balance or in surplus. This is essential for maintaining and further strengthening confidence in the policy framework in the euro area and for establishing fiscal positions in all countries that allow automatic stabilisers to work efficiently without endangering sound fiscal positions in the longer term. In the field of structural reforms we continue to urge governments to implement, in a determined way, the agenda set in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Structural reforms will contribute to expanding the euro area's potential for non-inflationary growth and to reducing its high level of unemployment. At the same time, they will help to foster confidence among consumers and investors in long-term growth and employment opportunities in the euro area, thereby having a positive effect on spending and investment decisions in the short and medium term. Such confidence is fostered by a determined and broadly based implementation of the reform agenda, focusing, in particular, on labour and product markets. We are now at your disposal for questions. Yes. Well, if there is a jump in oil prices, as there has been already, in the first instance it is a danger, an upward risk for inflation. And – in the sense that there is basically a real transfer of resources going on in this direction – it is a threat for the pace of the recovery. What the ECB can do about it is very little, if indeed anything at all. Yes, I cannot keep on repeating myself. But today I said that the monetary policy stance is appropriate and I cannot say more than that. No, but you always ask this question. If you had asked ""is there a bias?"" I would have said ""No, we are completely neutral at this moment"". I cannot quantify that uncertainty over a period of time. We think that all the factors are in place to let growth go up to its potential – sorry, not in the second half of this year as we thought earlier, but, we think, in the first half of next year. How great the risks are to that assessment? We live in a time of extreme uncertainty at the moment, and I really cannot quantify it. But let me say, ceteris paribus, we should be on track in the first half of next year. I would not speculate on future developments which I hope will not take place. I think any impact on the euro would be negligible. But the Irish referendum – from a constitutional and an institutional point of view – is extremely important. And I do hope that the Irish, this time, join forces with the mainstream in Europe. The question was addressed to both the Vice-President and me. Would the Vice-President like to answer? Papademos: You mentioned a low acceptance. We haven't noticed that. Unless you mean something else, because I think in both countries there was an enthusiastic acceptance of the euro from the first day it was introduced. Now, there have been, of course, some concerns regarding the perceived impact of the changeover on price changes and perhaps you are referring to this. This is a phenomenon that has been observed in various countries because the prices of certain services and certain goods have increased by what is perceived as a significant extent and this has then been generalised so as to imply that the introduction of the changeover has had a significant impact on inflation. But what, of course, we know from the statistics is that – although it is correct that the prices of some services and some goods have risen somewhat more, and perhaps this has been influenced by the changeover – the weighted average of the prices of all goods, as recorded by the consumer price index, has been influenced to a very small extent. And you know what the estimates are. The estimated impact is in the order of about 0.2 percentage point. So it is true that there is a discrepancy between perception and reality as recorded in the statistics. I might say that I am equally worried about the inflation prospects as I am about the output prospects. I am very pleased that risks to inflation seem to be balanced at the moment. I am not so pleased that the acceleration of output, which we expected, is taking so long to take hold. As regards the second question, the ECB is not even mentioned in the Stability and Growth Pact, but we do play a role, I admit, and I take great comfort in that at the Summit in Seville the Heads of State or Government solemnly declared that they would adhere to the goals set. Well, answering the first question also answers the second. Nothing has been decided yet. And I regard it as crucial, if there are more level committees to be level one, level two or level three, I regard it as crucial – and we are working on that – that both the ECB and the national central banks, and I mean not only those which are in charge of supervision directly, but all of them, are somehow involved in the work of all committees, because there is a close synergy between central banking and supervision and regulation. We should be there. But then it is maybe good to know that the Lamfalussy proposals were made explicitly for the securities industry. And you cannot simply transpose the Lamfalussy scheme to the banking sector or financial industry in general. The first to agree to that would be Mr. Lamfalussy. I don't now whether you know, but I can confirm that Mr. Lamfalussy himself last Friday gave an exposé and his judgement to the EFC, the Economic and Financial Committee. I know that the Economic and Financial Committee, of which the ECB is a member, listened with great care to Mr. Lamfalussy and will take up his ideas and his judgements along with all the other considerations in preparing the final proposal for the structure of European co-operation in banking supervision and regulation for the ECOFIN meeting of 8 October. This is the whole process – nothing has been decided yet, but the process is in motion and, in my opinion, it is in motion in a good direction. I would not join in the speculation about what will happen to the German budget in the course of this year. I note with satisfaction the determination of the German government to ""stick to its guns"", so to speak. As far as the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, in no way would it affect the – as you call it – ""degrees of freedom"" which the ECB has to follow its independent monetary policy. So it would be no inhibition whatsoever. On the risk of a war or military operation in Iraq: of course, this adds greatly to the uncertainties we are confronted with and to which I referred earlier. What precise impact an eventual military adventure might have on the monetary policy of the ECB or on inflationary developments depends, of course, very much on the nature and the size of the activities to be deployed, and the effects – in particular – on the oil market and on the remainder or the rest of the region in the Middle East, and is therefore, at this stage, totally unpredictable. But it is one of the uncertainties you and we are being faced with. And I prefer, also in this respect, not to speculate about any likely consequence or any likely reaction to what we know or what we don't know is going to happen. Last question first. Today's decision was, as so often, again a consensus decision. I would not report on voting, but it was again a consensus decision. There was no dissent, let me put it that way. On the Stability and Growth Pact, I hear the voices here and there who want to change the rules of the game. The ECB sticks to its policy, which says ""Don't change the rules of the game when you have only just begun playing"". Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, I am sure that you also discussed the G7 meeting in Washington with the Greek Finance Minister and maybe already a possible stance on Friday and Saturday in Copenhagen. What do you say as far as the exchange rate policy is concerned? Can we expect a statement from the point of view of the euro? And how do you assess the dollar risks, especially if you consider the enormous imbalances in the current account. Mr. Issing pointed this out last Friday in Frankfurt very clearly as well. I am sorry, Mr. Hutter. You know the exchange rate is not a target for our monetary policy. That is geared towards internal price stability. And I will not join you in making estimates of what the risks for the exchange rate are. I will not speculate on that. As far as the G7 is concerned, we indeed already co-ordinated our position in Copenhagen because it is both the Greek Minister of Finance and me who will attend the G7 meeting on behalf of the euro area. There is a general resentment amongst the public, and it may be growing here and there, against the perceived inflation, which is clearly higher in the eyes of the public than the measured inflation, which encompasses a much larger basket of goods, when you measure it over time. But the resentment amongst the public is in particular against perceived price increases. It is not against the euro – the euro is maybe the scapegoat for all that – but it is against the restaurateurs, against the hotel sector, hairdressers and so on, who may in the beginning have abused the transition to the euro by rounding, in a sometimes dramatic way, upward. Now it is our perception that the effects of the changeover are over. That does not mean that there are no price increases any more. But it is an understandable reaction of the public to blame, let me call it ""normal"" price increases on a new factor in particular, and that is the new money, the euro. But that will change over time. So I am not too concerned about it. But what I am concerned about is the discrepancy between the perceived rate of inflation and the actual rate of inflation. For example, if you think about goods which you do not buy that often, like a new computer, they have fallen in price. But that is not noticed as much as the daily beer or coffee you are inclined to buy. But it is crucial that this perceived rate of inflation does not become entrenched in the minds of people and thereby lead, for example, to wage demands which are higher than would be justified by the actual broadly based rate of inflation. Well, again, I will not enter into that debate, knowing that the debate is raging throughout the United Kingdom and the best thing I could do to prevent Britain from joining is to speak out about it. And for that reason I will refrain. But I do remember ten years ago – I was in Bath when that all happened, and when Britain took the plunge in the bath outside the ERM. We have no plans to introduce EUR 1 or EUR 2 banknotes, but we have also heard those noises. Of course, we have discussed it. We are assessing the implications of introducing such a banknote. In principle we have nothing against it, but we are assessing the implications and I hope that Mr. Tremonti realises that if such a banknote were to be introduced, he would lose the seigniorage which goes with it. So whether he, as a minister of finance, would be all that pleased, I do not know. I cannot elaborate on that. We are discussing it; I expect the discussion to lead to a conclusion in the course of this year. All that has been asked of us is to come up with a proposal, if necessary – that has also to be judged – to come up with a proposal as soon as possible after the ratification of the Nice Treaty. So we have still some time left, because the Treaty has not been ratified yet and we first have to wait, hopefully, for the outcome in Ireland on this. "
2002-07-04,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank met today for the sixth time outside Frankfurt. First of all I would like to thank our host, Governor Mersch, and the staff of the Banque centrale du Luxembourg, for the invitation and for the generous hospitality offered to us. Allow me also to add that the Governing Council today held its 100th meeting since the establishment of the ECB on 1 June 1998. We have not celebrated this event in any specific way, but we are pleased to draw your attention to this fact. Finally, let me, on behalf of the entire Governing Council, pay tribute to Pierre Werner, who passed away a few days ago. He was one of the founding fathers of the single currency and for this we will always be grateful to him. At today's meeting, the Governing Council continued its comprehensive examination of monetary, financial and economic developments and assessed new evidence that has become available over the past few weeks. Our conclusion was that while risks to price stability over the medium term remain tilted to the upside, recent evidence sends mixed signals. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 increased to 7.5% in the period from March to May 2002, from 7.4% in the period from February to April. While there was some normalisation of M3 growth in early 2002, M3 dynamics have strengthened again recently. This development may partly reflect renewed portfolio shifts into M3 instruments, related to the recent increase in overall financial market uncertainty. However, more fundamental factors, such as the low opportunity cost of holding money and the economic recovery in the euro area have also driven monetary expansion in recent months. In addition, the rate of growth of loans to the private sector has been recovering. While due caution in interpreting recent short-term monetary developments is warranted, it is a matter of concern that there is significantly more liquidity available in the euro area than would be needed to finance sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. Concerning the second pillar, the latest data confirm that a gradual recovery in real GDP growth in the euro area is under way. Information from several surveys and leading indicators for the second quarter of this year point to somewhat higher real GDP growth rates than in the first quarter. Looking ahead, an ongoing strengthening in both domestic and foreign demand continues to be the most likely scenario. The conditions for further recovery in the euro area remain in place. There are no major imbalances in the euro area and financing conditions are very favourable. At the same time, there is continued economic growth outside the euro area. However, in view of recent financial market developments, the uncertainty surrounding the strength of the economic upturn – both outside and inside the euro area – has not diminished over recent weeks. Turning to price developments, Eurostat's flash estimate indicates that annual HICP inflation fell from 2.0% in May to 1.7% in June. However, it is too early to interpret this fall as a sign of receding upward pressure on prices, given that HICP inflation excluding the more volatile items of energy and unprocessed food prices has remained high throughout the first half of this year, reflecting in particular trends in services prices. Moreover, it is to be expected that overall HICP inflation rates will fluctuate around 2% in the coming months. The strengthening of the euro exchange rate should have a moderating effect on inflation. However, it is difficult to quantify the size and establish the timing of this effect. For price stability to be maintained on a sustainable basis it is crucial that the high wage increases resulting from recent negotiations in some regions do not spread across the euro area, not least because this would have negative consequences for competitiveness, employment growth and consumption. Overall, the strengthening of the euro exchange rate is a new factor suggesting a potential for lower inflation rates. However, other factors – in particular monetary developments and wage trends – do not indicate a moderation in price pressures. Monetary policy therefore needs to remain vigilant as regards the key factors determining the outlook for price stability over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, we have seen some worrying developments in the past few months. Against this background we call upon all member countries to honour the commitments made to achieve budgets that are close to balance or in surplus by 2003-04, in compliance with the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is necessary in order to maintain and further strengthen confidence in the policy framework of the euro area and to establish fiscal positions in all countries that allow automatic stabilisers to operate efficiently without endangering sound fiscal positions in the longer term. Moreover, governments are encouraged to push ahead with reforms relating to the size and structure of public expenditure and revenue, which will also create room for tax cuts and absorb the fiscal costs of population ageing. In the field of structural reforms allow me to refer briefly to the adoption of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. If implemented in a determined manner, structural reforms will contribute to expanding the euro area's potential for non-inflationary growth and to reducing its high level of unemployment. We are now at your disposal for questions. It is always difficult to say how concerned we are. I am not without concern, both with a view to the developments in the United States and with regard to the European equity markets. But it is one of the factors we look at in assessing our monetary policy stance. And, as you know, we have decided to keep our monetary policy stance unchanged at the moment. So that should be the answer to your question. I would say that, given the structure of the holdings of equity in Europe, it would be more of a problem for businesses. In the United States, it would probably be more of a problem for consumers. As regards your last question there certainly is [a consensus]. As far as the balance between upside and downside risks is concerned, we believe that the risks are still somewhat on the upside, but the uncertainties are too great to come to decisions already at this stage. Well, you will have noticed that in my Introductory Statement I did not use the concept of ""hovering"", but of ""fluctuating"". That, however, is a purely editorial matter. The message is the same. For the remainder of this year, we expect the inflation rate to fluctuate, or hover, or whatever you may want to call it, around 2%. In our assessment, that in itself is not satisfactory. But we are taking a longer-term forward-looking view. And, as long as we are satisfied that the forces are such that inflation is likely to fall to just below that level next year, there is no reason for alarm – yet. I would say that this is the chief mitigating factor, together with the recent developments in oil prices, especially oil futures prices, which are also mitigating factors. And, if sustained, as long as these factors remain sustained, there is less and less reason to be alarmed. But, as I said in my answer to Mr. Thomas, the balance of risks in this world of uncertainty is still slightly on the upside. Well, I was not present in the discussion between Eurostat and Mr. Tremonti. What I do believe are the most recent statements to this effect by Eurostat and the revisions they made to the Italian public accounts. I hope it is as strong as it was. And we urge governments to stick to the commitments they made under the original Stability and Growth Pact. As I said, we are somewhat concerned about – may I call it – the ""slippage"" in interpretation which has emerged from Seville. Question (translation): Mr. President, you have pointed out the fact that the appreciation of the euro has curbed inflation repeatedly. Is the ECB thinking about, or even calculating, the percentage by which you have to increase the interest rates to get the same effect, as far as stability is concerned, as you would get from appreciation of say 5 to 10 cent? Our deliberations four weeks ago and today have led us to keep interest rates unchanged. We do not and we did not speculate, theorise or analyse about the size of any change that was not contemplated. If that is so, then I misunderstood the first question in German. I thought the question was about the size of an eventual change in interest rates. Papademos: Regarding your first question, as we stated in the Introductory Statement, it is difficult to quantify the size and establish the timing of the effect of the appreciation of the euro. One conclusion that one can stress from analyses that have been made in general is that the effects of the appreciation, both on inflation and on output, are likely to be visible more in the medium term: that is more in 2003 than in the present year. Now, with regard to your second question, you asked whether there was information about an increase in the holdings by non-residents of the short-term marketable instruments. Yes, there is information that there has been an increase in such holdings and this information is included in the figure given for the net external assets of MFIs, which have also risen substantially. The two developments together suggest that there must have been some offsetting in other types of liabilities of MFIs. Now, at the end of your question there was a concern as to how these developments - that is the increase in demand by non-residents - may affect monetary developments in the euro area. Let me say one point here, they do not create any distortion in the monetary statistics because, since last year, the M3 statistics have been corrected. So they do not include any holdings by non-residents, neither a share of money market funds nor other short-term money market instruments. On the first one, I would take issue with the hypothesis that European recovery relies solely on a resumption of exports. It is as much domestic demand-led as it is external demand-led. But at the same time, given that the recovery of domestic demand is also relatively weak, this explains our uncertainty, not about the size of the recovery, but about the strength of the recovery. But we are not relying on others, as I always used to say and still say: Europe is now on its own and we have to do it ourselves. Now, as far as the impact of the interventions is concerned, let me explain briefly. The interventions that took place last week were not co-ordinated interventions, they were interventions initiated by, at the request of, and at the expense of the Bank of Japan, which, under the existing agency agreement that both the ECB and the Federal Reserve have with the Bank of Japan, asked us to, apart from the interventions that they unilaterally made themselves, also do a tiny amount on their account and on their initiative in Europe. Now, the amount, it is fair to say in view of the size of the exchange market, was virtually negligible, and therefore it is by no means an explanation for the concomitant movements in the exchange rates which happened either on that day or in the days thereafter. The foreign currency and gold reserves of the Eurosystem were basically inherited from the past. Inside the Eurosystem there is no discussion and there can also be no conclusion about what precisely the appropriate size of the reserves of the Eurosystem should be. We are in the happy position where the Eurosystem as such holds so much foreign currency reserves that it will at all times be equipped to meet any disaster which might loom on the horizon. And the holdings place no constraint on whatever action we might want to take. The discussion on the so-called ""enabling clause"" – for when the European Community or European Union is drastically enlarged – is ongoing. We are making very good progress, but I must also say we are ultimately asked to come up with a recommendation on what and how things should be changed in the voting procedures of the decision-making bodies of the ECB as well. But we can only answer that question once the Nice Treaty has been ratified by all Member States, and that is still some months off, so we are not in a hurry. In the meantime, we are discussing various models in a very friendly and co-operative way, and it would be legally inappropriate for us to come up with a definitive proposal before the time is ripe to make such a proposal. And that is only after the ratification of the Nice Treaty. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, I would like to come back to your introductory statement. For a couple of months now, you have been saying that the ECB's Governing Council is concerned about the huge liquidity and inflation risks that you have under the first pillar. Secondly, you say that you are not absolutely certain as to how you can assess economic developments. But we are living in times of uncertainty, and I assume that this uncertainty will continue. If you wait and wait, is that not a risk for the credibility of the forward-looking, forward-oriented monetary policy? We have carefully considered and discussed the risks you draw attention to. As to the credibility of our attitude of, basically, waiting and seeing in these uncertain circumstances, we believe we have adequately explained why we have taken the attitude we cherish at the moment. So, we do see the risks you have pointed out, but we are taking the risks deliberately. Question (translation): You explained that you were somewhat concerned by the compromise reached in Seville as far as monetary policy is concerned. Could you give us a few more details on that and clarify your thinking somewhat? Do you think, for example, that the condition put forward by France to reach a budget position close to balance in 2004, if there is a growth of 3%, is bad? Do you think that might be an example other countries might want to follow? France made a unilateral declaration in Seville on how to interpret the goal of reaching a budget position close to balance or in surplus by, in this case, 2004. The other countries have taken note of this declaration that made the achievement of this goal more or less contingent on the attainment of a growth rate of 3% in 2003 and 2004 of 3%, which might be considered to be – to say it prudently – on the upside of the potential growth rate of the country. It is for that reason that I said in my Introductory Statement that the Governing Council is concerned, is worried about recent developments in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact, and we do urge governments to stick unconditionally to the commitments they made when they adopted the Stability and Growth Pact. ... may I answer this question first? Because the answer to ""how much"" is ""it did not"". And now your second question ... ... that is a lot of money ... ... but I do not have an answer. You are pointing to facts that are unknown to me. So, we did not discuss it. Well, not specifically ""when"" and ""where"". We had the impression in the past few years, for example, that much of the growth in credit to the private sector was being used for mergers and acquisitions in the United States. But we cannot follow that from day to day. And, in addition, I must confess that the statistics on the capital flows are coming in with significant lags of, in certain cases months. So, I cannot answer your question. If I could, I would. But if I cannot, I do not. Well, we take it into account as one of the indicators under our second pillar, which determines our monetary policy stance. But as you can derive from our decisions, it was not a decisive factor for a move in either direction. No, we look at it, but we are not talking about it in terms of concern or worry at this stage. It was extremely successful in terms of (i) the speed with which the notes were distributed and (ii) acceptance by the public at large. The effects on economic growth, to which you are referring, will come, but they will come over time. It requires time for price transparency and economic competition to work their way through into the economy. We do not expect sudden and quick results, but it is pretty certain that the results will come. "
2002-06-06,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Papademos, the new Vice-President of the ECB, and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council undertook a comprehensive examination of monetary, financial and economic developments and considered the evidence that has become available since its last meeting on 2 May 2002. Notwithstanding the recent decline in inflation, the outlook for price stability in the medium term remains less satisfactory than expected a few months ago. However, the economic outlook is still subject to uncertainty. Further evidence is needed before we can fully assess the upward risks to price stability over the medium term. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 decreased to 7.4% in the period from February to April 2002, down from 7.6% in the period from January to March 2002. While the high annual growth rate of M3 still partly reflects the portfolio shifts to liquid positions which occurred last autumn, and there was some normalisation in the development of M3 in early 2002, this trend towards moderation has recently been interrupted. In addition, annual rates of growth of loans to the private sector have stabilised over recent months. As regards the second pillar, our expectations for a gradual recovery in real GDP growth in the euro area have been confirmed by Eurostat's recently published first estimates for real GDP growth. These preliminary estimates show an improvement of quarter-on-quarter growth rates from -0.3% in the last quarter of 2001 to moderately positive rates in the first quarter of this year. Moreover, business and consumer confidence has strengthened again more recently, as reflected in the data published by the Commission. Looking ahead, available forecasts all point to a continued strengthening in both domestic and foreign demand, relating to a more favourable external environment, sound domestic fundamentals and the absence of major imbalances within the euro area. Overall, they suggest that real GDP growth in the euro area should again be in line with potential growth later this year, with a further increase expected in 2003. Despite this rather positive outlook, the assessment of the short-term dynamics of real activity is still surrounded by uncertainty. Moreover, future oil price developments and economic imbalances elsewhere in the world economy remain elements of risk. Turning to price developments, Eurostat's early estimate indicates that annual HICP inflation fell from 2.4% in April to 2.0% in May. However, this decline is mainly due to a base effect relating to the spike in HICP inflation in May 2001. Moreover, in the first months of this year HICP inflation excluding the more volatile items of energy and unprocessed food prices has remained stubbornly high, reflecting in particular trends in services prices. While a further decline in the annual inflation rate is possible in the short run, the medium-term outlook remains less satisfactory than expected a few months ago. Over recent weeks the exchange rate of the euro has appreciated. This will contribute to containing inflationary pressures, but it is still too early to assess the impact of exchange rate developments on the outlook for prices As stated on a number of occasions, the less satisfactory picture in the short term is due partly to a sequence of adverse but rather specific shocks to prices, including recent oil price increases. In principle, such shocks should unwind over time and therefore not affect the medium-term perspectives for price stability as long as past upward tendencies in prices do not become entrenched. The outcome of recent wage negotiations in some regions of the euro area is a cause for concern, especially in view of the negative impact this could have on continued employment creation. High wage increases must not spread across the euro area given that inflationary pressure, which would have unfavourable consequences for competitiveness, employment growth and consumption, is to be avoided. At this juncture it is therefore particularly important for monetary policy to remain vigilant with regard to the further evolution of the key factors determining the outlook for prices. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, it is vital that all Member States maintain a medium-term perspective in compliance with the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. Maintaining such a perspective will lead to a successful transition to budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus and to a smooth functioning of automatic stabilisers in all member countries. Let me therefore reiterate that the Member States concerned must honour the commitments made to achieve balanced budgets by 2003-4. Moreover, governments are encouraged to push ahead with reforms relating to the size and structure of public expenditure and revenue, which will also create room for further tax cuts and absorb the fiscal costs of population ageing. This reform agenda, as well as the urgent structural reforms relating to product, labour and financial markets, will be addressed in the forthcoming Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Overall, such reforms reflect the key challenge for the euro area to expand its potential for non-inflationary growth and to reduce its high level of unemployment. The Governing Council calls upon Member States to make faster progress in accelerating and deepening structural reforms in order to provide economic agents with the proper incentives to enhance efficiency and entrepreneurship and to progress towards a knowledge-based economy as proclaimed in the Lisbon agenda and confirmed in Barcelona. We are now at your disposal for questions. It is, as I said, still too early to say. Just before the end of last year, we expected, as you know, inflation to fall to what we then called safely below 2% in the early part of this year. Now, the developments in January, the weather conditions and the oil price hikes in January and February have crossed this expectation to the extent that the medium-term perspective is that inflation will later than earlier anticipated fall to below 2% or stay at 2%. And the expectation for next year also is that we will be very close to the 2% limit. And if the recent appreciation of the euro, which is very welcome I must say, persists it will contribute to containing the inflation expectations and the forecasts for inflation. But it is still too early to make definite statements on the quantitative extent to which this will be the case. Well, after the accession countries have become a member of the European Union, which is to be expected just before the middle of 2004, the time when the elections for the European Parliament take place, their central banks will automatically become a member of the European System of Central Banks, but not of European Monetary Union. For that, another number of years will be required in order to fulfil the Maastricht criteria in full and it remains to be seen how quickly, and that may differ from country to country, every individual country is in a position to comply with the criteria. And one of the criteria, as you know, is to have been a member of the European exchange rate mechanism, which they are invited to join sooner rather than later. But you have to have been a member for two years and, during those two years, not to have depreciated your currency. So I cannot put a timetable on when those tests will be met. But the moment of judgement will come not before two years have elapsed from the moment they become a member. I was not aware that tomorrow that working group was meeting. Of course, improvements could always be possible. But to my mind, it is more important to adhere to the goals set in the Stability and Growth Pact as it stands than to already start talking about changing the rules of the game. That is where my emphasis would be. Now the first part of your question was on the recommendations. Yes, we agree with the recommendations made by the Commission. First of all, the euro has appreciated vis-à-vis the dollar, but what is more important is to look at the overall effective appreciation of the euro which is decidedly less than simply the nominal appreciation vis-à-vis the dollar, and that is where the effects come from. In no way do we believe that at the present time the exchange rate is any impediment to the further growth and recovery of our exports. It is true that this probably will be the third year where we will miss or at least only come close to our stated objective. But we can explain why. In the past three years we have had an unusual accumulation and coincidence of negative shocks. I am referring to two oil price hikes, which we can explain but which we cannot take away and about which we can do nothing using monetary policy. So in a certain sense we have been disarmed of the weapons we use to fight inflation. We have to absorb that. There have been other shocks, too: I'm thinking of September 11, I'm thinking of the foot-and-mouth disease and other veterinary illnesses which have had an unexpected but upward impact on inflation and which help to explain this. I do believe that the prompt and adequate reaction of the ECB to underlying developments in the outlook for price stability in the form of a range of interest rate changes has been adequate, and that the fact that we are close to but not at, admittedly, an inflation rate in line with the maximum of our stated objectives cannot but enhance the credibility of the ECB. Well to the extent to which it is likely, as future prices indicate, we expect some moderation in oil prices. But as I said earlier, we have to wait a while before we can fully assess the impact on the appreciation of the euro. There are many uncertainties, but the risks have moved, let me say, in an upward direction. But we need more information, more data to come to an ultimate judgement. Well they could come back again, and they could even increase and then we would react. But as to when is completely undetermined. Since the end of last year, but we need time to fully assess what the impact of the ongoing developments is going to be. In no way. We are not thinking of changing our definition of price stability. Well, whether it is unusual, it is an ambitious target, if you want to call it a target. But it is simply a fact that the treaty mandates us to maintain price stability. Now the question is how to define that. We think that defining an upper limit of 2% is in a way ambitious but, in light of the circumstances, in light also of past events, it is ambitious but not impossible. Well, to take the last question first, I did point to some increased risks for price stability. So, it is not by chance that the word ""appropriate"" no longer appears in my statement. I want to emphatically state that that is not to say that there is now a so-called ""bias"", as Mr. Sims always asks, that has crept into our considerations. Mr. Eichel has apparently said that a higher exchange rate and lower interest rates were more favourable that the other way round. I would tend to agree with that. I cannot answer the last question because I do not speculate on what the ""appropriate level"" is for the euro in a world that is ever-changing. As far as the first question is concerned, the euro exchange rate is one of the broad range of indicators we look at when assessing – through the second pillar of our strategy – our monetary policy stance. And then, I said literally, over recent weeks – and it is weeks only – that the exchange rate of the euro has appreciated. This will help to contain inflationary pressures and that is welcome, and this is one of the counter-forces against other forces which point in another direction. I must first of all say that I do not take questions on either matter. I have no judgement on the adequacy or the usefulness of the policies executed by the Ministry of Finance in Japan. I fully understand their fear that an ever-stronger yen might jeopardise the early signs of recovery which are emerging in Japan. On co-ordination, which is effectively asking questions about interventions, I will always comment afterwards. Well, I indicated in my introduction one other factor, which we look upon with some concern, and that is wage agreements which are being concluded here and there. I'll not comment on the ""here"" or the ""there"", but they seem to be adding to the upside risks. So there you have one other reason. Question (translation):  Mr. Duisenberg, I have two questions. First, the ECB Council certainly approved the projections that are supposed to be published in eight days. What are these projections worth if you are saying that the interest rates are not going to change and that there is a higher expectation that in two or three months or maybe one month interest rates will not remain unchanged? Second question, risk projections. How big is the risk that American share markets and the American stock exchange will collapse and that this might have an effect on the dollar rate? How do you see this and its impact on the world economy? I cannot answer the last question. If there is a sudden collapse in any financial market that would be speculating to an irresponsible extent. And you can imagine yourself, what the consequences would be. Now, we will publish – as we do twice a year – our new forecast in, I believe, seven days time, in the forthcoming issue of the Monthly Bulletin, and this still has to be finalised. Also, after today's discussion there were suggestions – although they are staff forecasts – and suggestions can be made and have been made. They will contain ranges and I can assure you that they will reflect the slightly worsened outlook for inflation as compared with the previous prognosis. That is not to say that they have already reached a level which would cause us to act today. I heard about this statement on my way down to this room. When I heard about it, my spokesman added that the French Ministry of Finance had immediately toned it down. And I have reason to believe, I might say from the highest sources, that there can be no doubt that France, as a full member of the euro area and the European Union, will live up to its commitments which it took upon itself when establishing the Stability and Growth Pact at the Summit in Dublin. "
2002-05-02,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council comprehensively examined monetary, financial and economic developments and also considered the accumulated changes in the economic outlook since its decision to lower the key ECB interest rates in November 2001. We concluded that the prospects for price stability appear to be somewhat less favourable than they were towards the end of last year. At the same time, we recognised that the economic outlook remains subject to uncertainties and that price developments partly reflect the influence of specific temporary factors. Accordingly, we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 decreased to 7.5% in the period from January to March 2002, down from 7.8% in the period from December 2001 to February 2002. The high annual growth rate of M3 continues to reflect the portfolio shifts to liquid positions which occurred last autumn. In the meantime there has been some normalisation in the development of M3, as indicated by the slowdown in its short-term dynamics in early 2002. The annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector also continued to decline in March. However, M3 growth has only slowed relatively recently and, for the time being, the reversal of built-up liquidity is proceeding only slowly. As regards the second pillar, our expectations for a rebound in real GDP growth in the euro area have been confirmed by recently published forecasts of international organisations, which all paint a similar picture. While the recovery in 2002 is expected to initially proceed at a gradual pace, real GDP growth rates in the euro area should again be in line with potential growth later this year and solid growth rates should be attainable by 2003. Business confidence has considerably improved in the euro area over the past few months and the conditions for a sustained upswing in domestic demand continue to be in place, including favourable financing conditions. The more positive international environment should also help stimulate euro area exports, thereby fuelling aggregate demand in the euro area. Finally, sound fundamentals and the absence of major imbalances support the positive outlook for the euro area economy. However, there are still a number of uncertainties surrounding the strength of the current upswing, such as those related to the future development of oil prices and to the impact of existing imbalances elsewhere on the world economy Turning to price developments, trends in inflation – with annual HICP increases of 2.7% in January falling to 2.2% in April, according to Eurostat's early estimate – have been less satisfactory than expected a few months ago, not least as a result of higher oil prices. As stated on previous occasions, price developments in both 2000 and 2001, and again in recent months, have been shaped by a sequence of adverse but rather specific shocks to prices. These should unwind sooner or later and, in principle, such shocks should not affect the medium-term outlook for price stability. However, it is essential that past upward tendencies in prices – even though they partly resulted from a clustering of specific factors – do not become entrenched. Recently published forecasts of price developments in the euro area, developments in indicators of inflation expectations and recent trends in wage settlements neither clearly confirm nor entirely contradict the risk of such entrenchment. At this juncture, it is therefore particularly important to remain vigilant with regard to the further evolution of the key factors determining the outlook for prices. On the basis of current information, it is still possible that annual HICP inflation rates will fall below 2% in the coming months. However, the outcome is highly dependent on oil price developments. The rather protracted upward trend in services prices is also a factor to be taken into account. For next year, projections for price developments depend largely on the assumption of continued wage moderation. The outcome of the ongoing wage negotiations in some regions of the euro area could become a matter of concern. Excessive wage increases could create additional cost pressure with potential consequences not only for prices but also – to an even greater extent – for employment creation and real GDP growth. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, let me reiterate the views previously expressed. It is vital that those Member States that have not already done so manage the transition to budgetary positions in balance or in surplus so that the Stability and Growth Pact can operate smoothly and effectively in future. Commitments made to achieving balanced budgets by 2003-4 must therefore be honoured by the Member States concerned. The Governing Council calls upon Member States to make faster progress in implementing comprehensive structural reforms – in public expenditure and revenues and product, labour and financial markets. The forthcoming finalisation of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for 2002 will be an opportunity both to take stock of the unfinished agenda following the agreements of Lisbon and, more recently, of Barcelona and, in particular, to accelerate the implementation of reforms. As we have said on numerous occasions, such reforms are needed to increase the growth of real GDP and employment on a sustainable basis. Past experiences both inside and outside the European Union indicate that measures to promote the efficiency and integration of markets, the encouragement of entrepreneurship and the fostering of a knowledge-based economy are clearly working in this direction and are thus in the interest of all member countries. We are now at your disposal for questions. The main risk I have in mind is the huge and growing current account deficit of over 4% of GDP in the United States which, I am inclined to say, is a risk to the world economy. I am not, however, going to speculate about what would happen should this situation develop further. I hope it can be contained in due course because, over time, I regard it as unsustainable. I am not as sure as I was before that, on average, we will be below 2%, but we will be close to 2%. The recent sharp increase in oil prices and perhaps a somewhat greater impact of the cash changeover on the rounding of prices has made us reconsider the outlook for prices. We will, therefore, be close to 2% on average, but I am no longer in a position to state with as much certainty as I did before that we will be below this level. We have had some disappointments, may I say, but one factor that could help to attain this goal, of course, once it works its way through, is the effect of the recent strengthening of the euro, provided that it continues. I am not going to comment on exchange rate developments. What I am concerned about is the tendencies that may emerge, and indeed may already have emerged, towards increased protectionism, as has happened in the United States in the steel sector. Neither the exchange rate nor the current account deficit should be instrumental in strengthening these tendencies. We briefly discussed it in the knowledge that the ECOFIN Council will next week probably go in the direction of taking a decision on the future co-operation of supervisory and central bank authorities. Our position is that the Treaty clearly states that the ECB's mandate is to foster the smooth conduct of supervisory practices and financial stability by the competent authorities. Our mandate compels us to include in the discussion of the ministers the relevant provision in the Treaty, and we try to do that by incorporating our Banking Supervision Committee in the structure that will probably emerge. I believe when I stated in my introductory remarks that the outcome of ongoing wage negations in some regions of the euro area could become a matter of concern, I think those who can hear can also listen. And I am sure that in Germany they perfectly understand what I was alluding to. Are the risks to price stability now on the upside rather than on the downside? All the remarks I made do indicate that there is a great deal of uncertainty, that we have had some, may I call them, ""disappointing"" developments in the area of oil prices, and of services prices in general, and therefore that, added to the wage developments that are going on here and there, I would be inclined to say that the risks are indeed now more on the upside than on the downside. I am sure that that question will not be on the agenda. We can't repeat the same text every time. We do regard the current monetary policy stance as being appropriate, but we also admit that the uncertainty surrounding our assessment is greater than ever. I would not speculate on a more rapid development of whichever exchange rate, as you can understand. A continuing appreciation, or even a continuation at the current level, will help us at least in keeping inflation under control. And that is a good thing. And I do not believe that it will have, as far as it has gone now, any impact on the real economy developments, on output and export capabilities. As to your first question on whether the current solidity of the euro marks a change in market sentiment, well, I hope it does. But I have to admit that, because the relationships with other currencies – sterling, the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen – have not changed to the same extent, it is more a dollar weakness than a euro strength. I also said in my introductory statement that if you look at the short-term dynamics, then the rate of M3 growth is coming down much more rapidly than is clear from the annual comparisons. Indeed it is coming down very moderately, very slowly, but it is in any rate coming down, and we will not stop looking at M3 as a symbol for all monetary developments. We use M3, but we also look at M1, credit to governments, credit to the private sector, etc. However, we cannot encompass all the monetarily relevant phenomena in just the one concept of M3. So, you have to look at it as a symbolic entity. As to your second question, we have not discussed it at all today. We are still in the process of coming up with a proposal which can be unanimously approved by the Governing Council. I have to say that in my home country, the move towards a relatively high rate of inflation has been very much initiated by a specific factor, namely the increase in indirect taxation, which in itself was – and now I am speaking as a Dutchman – a highly sensible and welcome measure in changing the tax structure. Only the timing could not be foreseen but came at a very unfortunate moment. As in all countries, there will be inflation differentials among the various regions all the time, just as there are in the United States, but then there will also be forces at work to diminish those differentials. We saw this two or three years ago, particularly in the case of Ireland, and that situation rectified itself, as it will indeed do here. No, this is not the case. I still believe that we will reach the potential growth rate of the euro area – which we estimate to be between 2 and 2.5% – towards the end of this year and that next year we will even surpass it. So we are no more or no less optimistic. When I talk about these things, I indeed take a euro area perspective. I talk about the outcome of an analysis which we are constantly making of the euro area as a whole, and that includes our assessment of the developments in individual countries such as Germany. There you are totally correct. Körber: Ladies and gentlemen, given that there are no further questions, the President would like to say a few last words. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. I would like to take this opportunity to thank most of all my colleague sitting next to me, Christian Noyer, who is attending his last press conference in his capacity as Vice-President. I would like to thank him for the unrelenting support and co-operation he has extended to my colleagues and to me in particular. Christian, thank you very much. I believe I can say this on behalf of the press as well. Noyer: Thank you. "
2002-04-04,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. As usual, we examined recent monetary, financial and economic developments. The Governing Council concluded that the current level of key ECB interest rates remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term and, accordingly, decided to leave them unchanged. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 stood at 7.8% in the period from December 2001 to February 2002, compared with 8.0% in the period from November 2001 to January 2002. The high level of the annual growth rates of M3 continues to reflect the past portfolio shifts to liquid positions. These shifts primarily occurred during autumn 2001, when the economic and financial environment was characterised by high uncertainty. However, in the meantime, some normalisation in the development of M3 has taken place. This is indicated by a significant slowdown in the short-term dynamics of M3 in early 2002, a period in which the annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector has also continued to decline. However, the period of moderation in monetary growth has as yet been too short to allow a definitive assessment. Against this background, the Governing Council continues to hold the view that the information from the first pillar does not thus far point to risks to price stability. Nevertheless, the persistence of excess liquidity in the economy could become a concern once the economic recovery in the euro area gathers pace. As regards the second pillar, the trough in economic activity was in all likelihood reached at the end of last year. Further information received over the past few weeks, i.e. surveys, financial market and leading indicators, strengthened the expectations of a recovery in the course of this year. While some uncertainty remains as regards the precise pattern of the recovery, not least in the context of a substantial increase in oil prices, the latest evidence has reinforced our previous assessment. Real GDP growth rates in the euro area should again be in line with potential growth later this year. Domestic factors support the recovery. First, a reversal of the past inventory drawdown is under way and real disposable income growth is expected to benefit from lower rates of inflation. Second, financing conditions are favourable. We also expect the stronger international environment to play an important role in stimulating euro area exports, and both domestic and external factors should foster investment. Finally, the positive outlook for the euro area economy is very much supported by sound fundamentals and the absence of major imbalances. Turning to price developments, let me first recall that, over recent months, annual rates of consumer price inflation have been affected by several factors of a special or temporary nature. This volatile pattern was broadly anticipated. However, annual inflation rates are currently somewhat higher than was expected a few months ago, with early estimates for March pointing to a figure of 2.5%. This is mainly because oil prices have again risen significantly in the more recent period. If sustained, higher oil prices would also have an impact on inflation rates in the remainder of 2002. While inflation rates are expected to fall to below 2% later in the coming months, this decline may possibly be less pronounced than was foreseen, and inflation rates during this year could turn out to be somewhat higher than previously expected. Beyond the shorter term, upward pressure on prices from aggregate demand should, in the light of current projections of a gradual economic recovery in the euro area, remain contained. In addition, the outlook for inflation is fundamentally dependent on wage moderation. Such moderation is important not only in order to contain risks to price stability but also to foster employment growth. As I have already noted on earlier occasions, there is some cause for concern with regard to ongoing wage negotiations. Fiscal policies in the euro area can also contribute to the maintenance of a favourable outlook for non-inflationary growth. It is vital that the commitments made to achieving balanced budgets by 2003-04 be firmly followed up in the Member States concerned. A continuation along the path of fiscal consolidation is essential, as is vigilance in ensuring strict adherence to the medium-term plans and rigorous implementation of the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact. Equally, the expected recovery should be seen as an ideal opportunity to strengthen efforts towards implementing comprehensive structural reforms – in public expenditure and revenues and product, labour and financial markets. Heads of State and Government confirmed this objective during their recent meeting in Barcelona. If implemented vigorously, such reforms could increase the growth of real GDP and employment on a sustainable basis. Past improvements in the functioning of markets, together with wage moderation, have contributed to strong employment growth and a considerable reduction in unemployment. It is therefore clearly in the interest of all countries to continue to rigorously implement the agenda agreed in Lisbon and recently confirmed in Barcelona. We are now at your disposal for questions. We still think that inflation will fall to below 2% later this year, i.e. in the coming months, and, on average, we still think and are confident that it will be below but close to 2%. Well, consumer confidence remained broadly unchanged in March, while it has increased slightly in the first quarter of 2002 as a whole. And now, the more subdued behaviour of consumer confidence, as compared with industrial confidence, is in line with similar developments at other turning points in the cycle. Therefore, to answer your question quite frankly, we do not think that a recovery in the euro area will be predominantly export-led. It will be predominantly domestic demand that will lead it. Yes. I do think that adhering to the goals set in the Stability and Growth Pact will enhance confidence amongst the public that governments are keeping to their plans and will, thereby, increase the credibility of economic policies as such. And the measures on the labour market that are being contemplated in various countries differ very much from country to country, but I do think it is very much of interest to restructure the functioning of the labour markets, in particular in the countries you have mentioned. If the recent rise in oil prices, which has been significant, persists or even continues to rise, there will obviously be risks to both inflation and output developments. But it is a big ""if"". I hope it is. I said ""later, in the coming months"". Well, May is one of the coming months. How do I assess the risks to price stability? The conclusion: that we regard the current monetary policy stance as appropriate, to my mind, speaks for itself. We have not. As far as we can measure, the impact of the cash changeover to the new currency has only had a very limited impact on the overall price index on a very broad basket of prices of goods. Now, it is true that in some sectors, particularly the ones you mentioned, services, larger price increases have been observed and if you look at, in particular, the goods that are – let me say – closest to the hearts and the wallets of the population, i.e. the cost of a haircut or going to a restaurant, then you notice it. That may cause some – let me call it – ""bias"" in the judgement of the people, and I do hope that that effect will fade away sooner rather than later. What I said about the current monetary policy stance should be enough. It is appropriate and I do not want to engage in any speculation about future moves. We do not know. I agree with the statement that if there are risks they are mainly on the upside. To what extent and how quickly they would emerge or materialise is totally uncertain. It is too early to tell. Question (translation): I have two questions. Mr. Duisenberg, would it be a problem for the European Central Bank to have missed the stability target of below 2% for two consecutive years and this year as well because of the oil price and other aspects? Second question. I would like to refer to the informal ECOFIN Council, which is meeting in Oviedo. In your meeting in the Council today, did you talk about possible candidates that you might have to choose? Do you think the successor of Mr. Christian Noyer will be appointed in Oviedo? I do not want to speculate again about the possibility that inflation on average might turn out higher than 2%. As I already said in answer to an earlier question, we are confident that we will be below but close to 2% on average this year. And as far as the succession of my distinguished colleague here is concerned, I refrain, also there, from speculating. I expect a proposal maybe in Oviedo or shortly thereafter. And you will understand that the right of initiative is this time fully with the Ministers of Finance. Our judgement will come at a later stage. To take the last question first. The Italian government is one of the twelve that have committed themselves to reaching the goals set in the Stability and Growth Pact by 2003 and 2004. So, what the deficit in 2002 will turn out to be is not out of line with that intention. As far as the statement by President Welteke is concerned, I would like to remind you that he has declared that the Bundesbank may sell some of its gold stocks over the medium to long term. However, the Bundesbank is also a signatory to the Central Bank Gold Agreement, which expires only in September 2004. Thus, his statement only refers to the period after that. And then I am sure that the Bundesbank, as all signatory central banks are doing, will act in a very responsible manner. Well, the management of both the foreign reserves and the domestic assets of any national central bank falls, beyond certain thresholds, under the guidelines and guidance of the ECB. That is one thing. And to buy equities is, let me put it this way, for many central banks not unusual. I do not expect that. The succession of Ms Hämäläinen and – may I add – of myself is not yet on the agenda. That is not a short-term problem. I expect that to be dealt with in the first half of next year. "
2002-03-07,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. First of all, we were pleased to see that the euro cash changeover went so smoothly – more smoothly in fact than we could have hoped. The European public very quickly became familiar with the new banknotes and coins, as is shown by the fact that national banknotes were largely withdrawn well before the final deadline of their ceasing to be legal tender. The Governing Council wishes to express its gratitude once more to all those who helped to make the euro cash changeover such a success. As usual, at today's meeting we examined recent monetary, financial and economic developments. The Governing Council concluded that the information which had become available in recent weeks confirmed that the current level of key ECB interest rates remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 stood at 8.0% in the period from November 2001 to January 2002, compared with 7.8% in the period from October to December 2001. The high level of the annual growth rates of M3 is very much related to portfolio shifts to liquid positions, most of which occurred in the autumn of 2001 in an economic and financial environment characterised by high uncertainty. While many investors still seemed to be ""parking"" some of their assets in M3 in early 2002, some moderation in the short-term dynamics of M3 could be observed around the turn of the year. The Governing Council continues to hold the view that the information from the first pillar thus far does not indicate risks to price stability, as the portfolio reallocations which drove M3 growth in 2001 should remain temporary. In addition, the slowdown in the rate of growth of loans to the private sector has been continuing over the past few months. However, we will need to analyse monetary developments closely in the coming months. As regards the second pillar, there are further signs that the trough in economic activity may have been reached at the end of last year. Coincident and forward-looking indicators increasingly point to improvements in economic conditions. A similar picture is reflected in financial market expectations, especially those embedded in bond yields. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound and there are no major imbalances that would require a lengthy process of adjustment. The expectation of a recovery in the euro area in 2002 is furthermore supported by favourable financing conditions and by real disposable income benefiting from past and expected future declines in inflation. There is also increasing confirmation that economic activity outside the euro area is picking up, which should lead to a gradual strengthening of the external demand for euro area products and services. While the strength of the recovery remains uncertain, there are good reasons to expect a return of economic growth to levels in line with potential towards the end of the year. Turning to short-term price developments, annual consumer price inflation picked up substantially in January. Part of this increase was expected, as it related to base effects stemming from falling energy prices in early 2001 and to higher indirect taxes in some euro area countries. Furthermore, the increase reflected a considerable rise in unprocessed food prices due to adverse weather conditions in parts of Europe. Part of the latter effect seems to have been reversed in the meantime, as preliminary data for February indicate. Some increases have also been observed in oil prices and in the rate of growth of services prices in January. While there might have been an impact on specific service categories in January, overall there is no evidence that the euro cash changeover has had a significant upward effect on the average price level in the euro area or that the declining trend in annual inflation rates has been affected recently. In the coming months, the effects of past increases in energy and food prices should gradually subside and annual inflation rates should fall to below 2%. The recent behaviour of producer prices also points in this direction. Beyond that horizon, we expect little upward pressure on prices from aggregate demand and, barring unforeseen developments, inflation rates to be in line with price stability. However, the current favourable outlook for inflation fundamentally rests on the assumption of a continuation of wage moderation. As I already noted last month, there is some cause for concern with regard to ongoing wage negotiations. A continuation of wage moderation in the euro area is crucial not only to foster employment growth but also to support monetary policy in its task to maintain price stability. With regard to fiscal policy in the euro area, the Governing Council welcomes the reaffirmed commitments of the governments of euro area countries with fiscal imbalances to adhere to the objective of achieving balanced budgets by 2003-2004. The confirmation of the political will to continue along the path of fiscal consolidation is most appropriate. The Governing Council supports the actions taken by the European Commission in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact and the subsequent outcome of the ECOFIN Council meeting last month. It is now necessary to remain vigilant in order to ensure strict adherence to the medium-term plans and rigorous implementation of the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact. In order to further improve the fundamentals of the euro area and to put the expected recovery on a broad and sustainable basis, euro area countries must strengthen their efforts to implement comprehensive structural reforms. Over the past few years progress has been made with regard to enhancing the flexibility of euro area product and capital markets. Euro area countries have also made some headway in terms of improving the way their labour markets operate. These reforms, together with moderate wage developments, have contributed to the strong employment growth and the considerable reduction in unemployment witnessed in many euro area countries in the last cyclical upswing. However, it is worth noting that despite the continued high unemployment in the euro area, firms continue to report difficulties in terms of recruiting suitably qualified workers. This suggests that further improvements in the functioning of euro area labour markets and their ability to match labour supply and demand are needed. Evidence gathered in a recent Eurosystem analysis, which will be published shortly, supports this view. In this context I would also like to stress that structural reforms in different markets should not be seen in isolation. The more efficiently euro area product and capital markets function, the greater the success of labour market reforms will be in creating employment opportunities. We are now at your disposal for questions. As I said in my introductory remarks, we expect economic growth towards the end of this year to be back at its potential output level, and our estimate is that the annual potential output rate is close to 2.5%. As for energy markets, although these were not discussed today, I do hope that the summit in Barcelona will give further impetus to the privatisation and liberalisation of the energy market. The evidence that we have on producer prices is that they have been falling steadily over a substantial period of time and that will also ultimately be reflected on consumer prices. I have seen no evidence for a reversal of that trend. You will allow me not to comment on the qualities of all the candidates that are being put forward to succeed Mr. Noyer. I would hope that the European authorities responsible for this – of which I am not one – would come to a decision sooner rather than later. But I do admit that, inevitably, it appears to be a typically European phenomenon that these appointments are discussed across the regions of Europe given that we have different nationalities, cultures and languages. But that is only normal and it is a phenomenon we have to live with. Noyer: I think that the only answer is what is stated in the Treaty, as Mr. Duisenberg just said. You need to have a qualified individual with experience in monetary and financial fields, and the rest is a matter of judgement, on which I cannot comment. Noyer: That is difficult for me because first the Executive Board is a collegial body and it should always be remembered that it is not just a collection of individuals, but a team performing a number of tasks under the leadership of its President. So, in my mind, fitting well into the team and being a full team player is a key requirement. Secondly, the precise distribution of tasks among the Executive Board members is a decision of the Executive Board as a whole. In our experience, over the last four years, there has been a certain distribution of responsibilities which, in my opinion, has been very rational, but this is a matter to be discussed and decided on by the Executive Board as a whole and can always be amended if necessary. And thirdly, of course, being a member of the Executive Board means being a member of the Governing Council, and as a member of the Governing Council you need the same kind of qualities as for any member of the Governing Council. May I add that fourthly, you must always be prepared to attend a meeting or fulfil a task on behalf of the President when he is attending to other duties elsewhere. But what you may expect at one time or another to have to attend an euro group meeting or whatever it is alone and be accepted there by the participants. What else can I say, Mr. President? You have said more than enough. (Laughter) We are indeed reasonably optimistic and, as I said, we see the growth reaching a figure which is about the estimated potential rate of growth towards the end of this year, and we expect that to continue into 2003 and 2004. That is our current expectation. So if you qualify that as reasonably optimistic, I would tend to agree with you. First on the speed with which inflation will fall below the 2% ceiling we have set for ourselves, I have not changed my mind. I expect that to happen in the course of the coming months – plural! I am not going to comment, of course, on the exchange rate. I am rather inclined to turn the thing around and conclude that apparently this – what I am almost inclined to say – deplorable action by the United States' authorities to protect its steel industry may have something to do with the exchange rate of the dollar as it is being experienced by the American steel industry. On the latter issue, I cannot tell you anything. We are working on it. But I would like to emphasise that the European Union Council has not asked us for a proposal to change. What the EU Council has done in the Nice Agreement is to include an enabling clause which makes it possible, after the Nice Treaty has been ratified, to make quick changes if necessary. We have started working on that in case we might consider it necessary – of which we are not yet sure. And what the EU Council has asked us to do is to come up with proposals, if required, soon after the ratification of the Nice Treaty. But that is still some way off. We are working hard on it, we are investigating various possibilities and we will finalise those investigations, I expect, in the course of this year – so well before the final ratification of the Treaty of Nice by the 15 Member States. What a question to ask a Dutchman! We are of the opinion that we reached the trough in real economic developments around the end of last year and the beginning of this year. As far as interest rates are concerned, we were, are and remain of the opinion that the current monetary policy stance in terms of interest rates is appropriate for the time being, and we are of the opinion that the economy has started to find its way back to recovery. I think that should answer your first question. Now, the linguistic issue. I am inclined to delete the ""s"" if I am talking about the euro in the plural, if I am talking about 10 euro. I think that is enough! Duisenberg. You have to understand that, when we talk about M3, it is a short-hand expression for a multitude of monetary developments. But we do not look only at M3. We also look at developments in credit to the private sector, to developments in the sub-components of M3, in other words M1 and M2, and it is based on that analysis and on a judgement of a broad spectrum of monetary indicators that we arrive at our conclusions as far as the first pillar is concerned. So please do not see us as mechanistically and narrowly watching only one figure: M3. And as I indicated in my introductory remarks, we do see some components of M3, both on the asset and the liability sides of the balance sheet, showing some signs of moderation already. But we will continue to monitor very closely whether this really is sustained, especially in an environment of a recovery of economic growth, as we are also witnessing. On the – if any – reform proposals of the decision-making bodies of the ECB, we are in the midst of the exercise; we are discussing it intensively among the 18 members of the Governing Council and at this stage, I really cannot say anything more than that. And I am not going to comment on particular elements or early stages of the discussions being held, which are fairly intensive and, I am inclined to say, fruitful. Duisenberg. The experts are in a position to quantify what you call the portfolio shift or the reluctance of investors to put their liquid assets into more long-term investments. The experts can do that; I do not know the figures by heart at this moment in time. But if you look at the developments, for example, the dynamic developments of M2 versus M3, then you get a pretty good indication of the quantities involved. Now, I hope that Mr. Noyer has had time to think in the meantime about the second question, because I do not know precisely what a money gap is. Noyer: (Laughing) I could have helped you slightly on the first question. According to the best possible expertise, but all this is of course disputable, filtering out the portfolio shifts could bring back notionally the increase towards 5%, close to 5% instead of 8%. So this gives an order of magnitude. Of course all the work of these experts is extremely careful but it is not scientific truth. It gives an order of magnitude that confirms the assessment that can be drawn from many other factors. Probably most of the explanation is linked to that. And, also, if you look at the annualised development of the last three months, you come to the same kind of conclusion – that it seems to be progressively – not completely returning to normal but going in the direction of more normal developments in the very last period. But all this has to be, as the President said, monitored carefully month after month. On the money gap, I prefer not to comment. Duisenberg. I am not going to comment on the performance of individual countries. You can only expect me to comment on a euro area wide perspective. I cannot quantify it. I think the impact on the euro area will be negligible. Those who will suffer most are the American consumers who will have to pay more for certain products than they would otherwise have to. I am thinking especially of the American carmakers and their customers whose lives will be made more difficult. Well, it is not exactly within the competencies of the European Central Bank, but I fully sympathise with all the efforts being made at the moment in the context of the World Trade Organisation to try to prevent, to the maximum extent possible, the world from slipping back into an era of protectionism. So I support all efforts being made along these lines to avert a trade war and all the detrimental economic consequences that entails, as we saw more than half a century ago. "
2002-02-07,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, as the Treaty on European Union was signed in Maastricht exactly ten years ago today, it was decided that it would be fitting to hold the fifth meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB outside Frankfurt here in this city in order to mark the tenth anniversary of what has become known as the ""Maastricht Treaty"". Indeed, the Governing Council today met in the same rooms in which the Heads of State and Government successfully concluded the Treaty negotiations. I should like to thank Governor Wellink, the Queen's Commissioner in the Province of Limburg, the staff of de Nederlandsche Bank and the city of Maastricht for their hospitality and for the outstanding way in which the meeting has been organised. When the Maastricht Treaty was signed, many doubted whether Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) would ever amount to more than the solemn words of a Treaty or a laudable objective to be reached at some point in the distant future. However, during the 1990s, policy-makers, governments, central bankers and other political and economic agents showed great resolve and determination to ensure that the single currency would become a reality. Today, we can look back on a period of more than three years in which the ECB has successfully pursued a stability-oriented single monetary policy serving more than 300 million citizens. And we all have the tangible proof of Monetary Union in our pockets, following a highly successful cash changeover process which represents another historic milestone in the process of European monetary integration. Indeed, already now the level of cash payments in euro is close to 100% in all the countries of the euro area. This means that the cash changeover can be considered as good as complete, i.e. well before 28 February, after which date the legacy currencies of the euro will no longer be legal tender in any euro area country. Together with the Treaties founding the European Communities, the Maastricht Treaty is one of the most important and visionary legal texts in the history of the European integration process. With the euro, the Treaty offered tangible proof of what the vision of European Union is about, namely bringing the people of Europe closer together and ultimately facilitating their lives. Having been instrumental in laying the foundations for the euro, the Maastricht Treaty will remain vital and indispensable for the successful functioning of EMU. The medium-term macroeconomic policy framework laid down in the Maastricht Treaty has contributed to a stable macroeconomic environment, and will continue to do so. In addition, the Treaty provides for a clear allocation of responsibilities between EU institutions and Member States, as well as clear mandates for all involved. The maintenance of price stability – the ECB's primary objective –, the independence of the Eurosystem and the provisions safeguarding fiscal discipline, in particular as enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact, are among the hallmarks of this framework. Furthermore, the path towards participation in the euro area mapped out in the Maastricht Treaty, focusing on sustainable economic convergence as a prerequisite for adoption of the euro, will also serve to guide prospective Member States. The name Maastricht will therefore always be connected with the euro and will forever have a prominent place in the history of Europe. Let me now turn to our regular examination of recent monetary, financial and economic developments. The Governing Council concluded today that there was no reason to change its previous assessment. Accordingly, the key ECB interest rates were kept unchanged at a level which remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 rose to 7.8% in the period from October to December 2001, from 7.4% in the period from September to November. The Governing Council considers that monetary developments thus far do not indicate risks to price stability. The build-up in liquidity reflected in these data occurred in an economic and financial environment characterised by exceptionally high uncertainty worldwide and should therefore be only temporary. This assessment of low inflationary risks is also supported by the declining trend in the growth rate of loans to the private sector. However, a continuation of strong M3 growth could call for a reassessment of monetary developments, especially if there is further evidence of a recovery in the euro area economy. Regarding the second pillar, while actual euro area production growth in the fourth quarter of last year and in the early part of this year is still expected to be subdued, new data confirm our expectation of a gradual improvement in economic activity in the course of the year. Uncertainty as regards the global environment seems to be gradually decreasing. In the euro area, the economic fundamentals remain sound and financing conditions favourable. Together with higher growth in real income, stemming from the past and future declines in inflation, these factors should support overall demand. This assessment appears to be reflected both in recent improvements in survey data and in financial market developments. Although the timing and strength of the upturn remain uncertain, the overall evidence points to a resumption of economic growth. We also continue to expect no medium-term upward pressures on inflation. However, as already indicated on several occasions, annual inflation rates at the beginning of this year will be somewhat erratic. Preliminary HICP data for January 2002 confirm this expectation but should not give rise to concerns as regards the medium term. The recent increase in inflation was to a large extent due to exceptional and short-lived factors – such as particularly adverse weather conditions in some parts of the euro area, which led to increases in food prices – as well as to the anticipated influences of indirect taxes and base effects resulting from developments in energy prices. Taking these factors into account, there is no evidence so far of a significant impact on the price level as a result of the euro cash changeover. Nor do we expect substantial effects in the months to come. There is reason to assume that the physical introduction of the euro banknotes and coins will strengthen competition, thereby supporting the maintenance of price stability. Beyond the short term, the outlook for inflation remains favourable. One important concern, however, relates to forthcoming wage negotiations. If wage moderation is maintained, as we currently expect and in any case consider warranted in order to foster employment growth, and assuming that other determining factors also develop favourably, annual inflation rates should fall safely below 2% this year. They should also remain at levels consistent with price stability. Finally, let me underline the importance which the Governing Council attaches to the Stability and Growth Pact and its strengthening through diligent implementation of the appropriate procedures. The responsibility for these procedures lies with the European Commission and the ministers of finance. The Governing Council fully supports all steps to avoid the occurrence of excessive deficits and all efforts to reduce the public debt and bring the fiscal stance into line with the stability programmes in individual member countries in order to ensure the credibility of the commitments made under the Stability and Growth Pact. In the same vein, we very much support the continued initiatives to foster structural reform. We welcome the focus placed on these issues in the context of the forthcoming Barcelona summit and we are looking forward to swift and determined delivery of essential structural reforms in the goods, services and labour markets to promote the euro area's growth potential. We are now at your disposal for questions. I know that this is very much under discussion. The early warning has been issued by the European Commission. An early warning, that is the procedure, has to be accompanied by a recommendation. The recommendation can be: ""Please, government, stick to your policies and see to it that an excessive deficit is not reached"". But no additional measures need to be included in the recommendation. Then, after a few months, or even half a year, a new recommendation can be required. That is the procedure. If the situation in the meantime deteriorates or even does not improve, then that second recommendation should contain specific suggestions for measures to be taken. But we are not at that stage yet, as I just explained. So, in sum, the Governing Council of the ECB, i.e. the Eurosystem as such, strongly supports the initiatives taken by the European Commission, the European Commission being the guardian of both the European Union Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. As for the second question, how could governments react to that, well, I would say: ""Thank you very much and we will do our utmost"". I intend to resign on 9 July 2003 because, for purely personal reasons, I hope to be 68 on that day. And, I am inclined to say, enough is enough. I think it is a respectable age at which to resign. It is fully in line with my intentions, which I publicly stated when I accepted this assignment. And, I hope you will excuse me, but I will not give any judgement on any particular person and certainly not on one of my most outstanding colleagues, whom you just mentioned. Well, all the Heads of State and Government signed the Stability and Growth Pact in Dublin a few years ago. And I think it is up to them to decide how to vote or how to behave. But I understand also that in the procedures abstention will be counted as a negative vote. In my letter to Prime Minister Aznar of Spain, I stated that I wanted to resign on 9 July 2003 but that I would be willing to stay on somewhat longer if that, in the judgement of the Heads of State and Government, were in the interests of a smooth transition of the Presidency of the European Central Bank. This explicitly and implicitly excludes an earlier retirement than now envisaged. On the Stability and Growth Pact, what the Governing Council is most of all interested in is to uphold the procedures which are incorporated in the Pact, and their implications. Now, the early-warning system – just as giving an opinion, just as applying sanctions if things get really out of hand – is an essential element of the Stability and Growth Pact, its procedures as well as its content. It is of the utmost importance in the opinion of the Governing Council that both procedures and substance remain intact. And I do not know what will happen in the forthcoming days, I am not talking in terms of a compromise, but if there are ways to extract certain definitive and well-defined commitments from the governments concerned, that might replace the early warning. And then the early warning has fulfilled its purpose. Well, I can answer that only in very general terms. If Sweden ever – and I hope it will be sooner rather than later – applies for membership of Monetary Union, it will have to comply with the convergence criteria as formulated in the Maastricht Treaty. One of the criteria is central bank independence, and one of the elements of central bank independence is financial independence. For that reason, Sveriges Riksbank has to have adequate capital and reserves to absorb all shocks that any central bank might face. Any action in this respect in Sweden will be judged in that light, also by the ECB Governing Council. Why is for personal reasons – I have of course been thinking about it for a very long time. When did I finally make up my mind? That was the weekend before last. Where was I? In Amsterdam. Who did I consult? Only one person, my wife. Who did I inform? I then informed the President of ECOFIN, Mr. Rato, who informed the President of the European Council, Mr. Aznar. I also informed the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister of the Netherlands and, of course, I informed my colleagues on the Executive Board. That was in the course of last week and at the beginning of this week. There were two reasons why I went public. I admit that it is rather early to announce this intention. First of all, I went public in the interests of transparency and, admittedly, I was somewhat worried about the intensifying wave of speculative statements and articles in the markets and the media about the date of my departure, and also about a possible link – which there is not – between my departure and the appointment of the successor to my right-hand neighbour, Mr. Noyer, which has to be dealt with shortly. I judged – and my colleagues concurred – that this wave of uncertainty surrounding the ECB and the euro was detrimental to the image and the credibility of the ECB and the euro. We live in a world of uncertainty and by taking away one of the uncertainties, which I have now done, I think I have made a contribution to a climate of greater quietness concerning these two important institutions, the ECB and the euro. My succession will not be on the ECOFIN agenda next week. There is ample time for deliberations about my succession. Of course, there will be speculations in the future about who my successor will be and when my succession will be arranged. That is unavoidable. But at least one uncertainty has been removed and that is about the date of my departure. So nobody can doubt that any longer. On Allied Irish Banks: it concerns a subsidiary in the United States, but that is all I am going to say about it. The ECB is not in charge of banking supervision. And these events will not change the ECB's attitude towards banking supervision, which is, as its mandate says, to contribute to a smooth conduct of supervisory practices. And for the rest, banking supervision is in the hands, and will remain in the hands, of national supervisory authorities, be they central banks, be they independent authorities, be they mixtures of those two. Nothing there is required to change. It is a well known fact, and you can look this up in the records, that already when I was appointed I did not regard it as likely – and I made this public – that I would serve my full eight-year term. And I regard 68 as a respectable age to retire, after having helped and having been instrumental in building up a new institution like the European Central Bank. By that time I will have done the job for more than five years, and I think I can say we have achieved what we wanted to achieve and we are ready for the future. And, please, give me then some time to spend with more intimate circles than this job allows me to do at the present time. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, two questions. First of all, in December you wrote a letter to the Spanish presidency mentioning the successor for the Vice-President, Mr. Christian Noyer. Have you received any reply so far to that letter? Second question. You are going on from here to the G7 meeting in Ottawa. That meeting normally formulates an exchange rate declaration, a very general one. What verbal declaration will you take into that conference or, in other words, what are you going to say on the euro exchange rate? How are you going to present it to the outside world in the interests of the global economy and the euro area? The letter to Secretary General Solana which was written in December last year was a purely administrative and, may I say, usual affair. Whenever a vacancy becomes imminent in an institution, that institution writes a letter to the Secretary General of the European Council to warn the Council and to enable it to start in time the procedure to ensure the vacancy will be adequately filled. So that was purely administrative. Have I received an answer from Mr. Solana? The answer is ""yes"". He came to see me and in passing he said to me ""Oh, yes, I received your letter. Thank you very much."" In Ottawa, on the exchange rate of the euro: I do not regard it as very likely that the exchange rate of the euro will be mentioned in the communiqué that will be issued after the G7 meeting. They won't ask me. I do not know the answer. We still think that the recovery will get under way in the course of this year. I personally happen to think that in Europe we will see more definite signs already in the first half of this year, maybe towards the end of the first half of this year, but in any other respect, we have not changed our assessment for a gradual recovery which might take – and now I am talking for Europe only – the growth rate in the last part of this year up to the potential growth rate at an annualised rate. So that is up to 2-2½% – annualised – towards the end of this year. 67 is respectable, but my job here is not over yet. And my job does not end with the cash changeover and the introduction of the banknotes and coins. So I am perfectly happy to resign after serving slightly more than five years in order to see the entire process through and to have the European Central Bank and the euro firmly established in the minds of the European people. Regarding my plans for after 9 July 2003, except in the case that the Council were to ask me to stay on a little bit longer: I have no plans whatsoever, except to enjoy life a little bit more intensively than was possible up until now, with my wife and in the midst of my family, possibly partly away from the Netherlands, in France. I find that pure nonsense. I have various arguments for that. First of all, both as a Governing Council but also as an Executive Board we are a collegiate decision-making body which is different from, for example, a system where you have one president who decides everything, and which makes continuity imperative in the decision-making. And then I want to remind you that all members of the Executive Board have a fixed term. In the future, all members of the Executive Board will have a fixed term of eight years. Is it imaginable that all those members, who have a fixed term of appointment, not renewable, would suddenly become lame ducks in their last year? Then one addition: I must say, in my daily work, I experience Mr. Noyer as anything but a lame duck. I don't care when I hear that – as long as it does not interfere with my holiday plans after 9 July 2003. Question (translation): Mr. President, you said that there is enough time to decide on your successor, but don't you think it would be better to decide this as quickly as possible? I think Mr. Reynders said earlier that it would be necessary to decide before the end of the Spanish presidency of the European Union. What do you think? And a small question for Mr. Noyer as well: Mr. Duisenberg said that he could, if necessary, stay on longer. Do you think that this might be a possibility for you as well? Legally and personally? Duisenberg (translation): What Mr. Reynders said today was that he thought it would be desirable to nominate the Vice-President and the President at the same time. I think that is Utopian. I think that is all I want to say. Noyer (translation): On your second question concerning myself, well, there the situation is totally different. Mr. Duisenberg has a mandate of eight years and he has now said that he intends to retire before that mandate is up. Legally speaking, if he wanted to he could continue of course. My mandate was a four-year mandate and that ends on 31 May at midnight. And therefore, the situation is totally different. "
2002-01-03,Duisenberg,"Mr. Duisenberg: Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. We are currently writing history. This is a very good reason for the new President of the ECOFIN Council, Mr. Rodrigo Rato, the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr. Pedro Solbes, who both attended today's meeting of the Governing Council, and myself to brief you on the current status of the euro cash changeover. I would like to warmly welcome Mr. Rato and Mr. Solbes and give the floor first to Mr. Rato. pdf file,132 kb Thank you Mr. Rato. The Eurosystem – the European Central Bank and the 12 national central banks of the euro area – and all parties involved were confident that the euro cash changeover would be a success, given the enormous effort and preparation which went into this historic and unprecedented operation. Now, two days after the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins, I can say that the huge task of putting into circulation some 9 billion euro banknotes and over 51 billion euro coins serving more than 300 million citizens in twelve countries has so far progressed very smoothly, even beyond our own expectations. By the end of 2001, more than 6.5 billion euro banknotes worth some EUR 134 billion – amounting to approximately 50% of national banknote circulation – had been frontloaded, as had more than 37.5 billion euro coins with a total value of around EUR 12.4 billion. Broadly speaking, sub-frontloading was in line with the initial forecasts, and came to between 10 and 20% of the frontloaded amount. At the same time, the withdrawal of legacy currencies was well under way, as the circulation of national banknotes dropped sharply in 2001, falling from EUR 380 million on 1 January 2001 to EUR 270 million on 1 January 2002. As to the conversion of ATMs, this is very much on track. By 4 p.m. yesterday some 92 % of the total – i.e. around 190,000 machines – had been converted. Later on this afternoon a press release with further updated figures will be released. The Eurosystem is proud of its contribution to this historic event. We have been working hard since 1996, when the competition for the design of the euro banknotes was launched, and especially for the past three years, to ensure a successful introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. Today, we can see that our efforts and those of all parties involved have not been in vain. In particular, I should like to express my gratitude to the banking community and the retailer sector and to all European citizens for the enthusiasm they have shown for the euro since the euro coin starter kits went on sale in December, but specially since 1 January. It is because Europeans have seized the opportunity to play an active part in the euro changeover that we can already pronounce this unprecedented move a tremendous success. With the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins, the euro has ceased to be a currency familiar only to the financial markets, to financial institutions and large enterprises. On 1 January at 00.00 hour, the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins marked not only the completion of Economic and Monetary Union, which is a crucial achievement in itself, but one of the major, if not the major step forward in the history of European integration. I am convinced that 1 January 2002 will appear in the history books in all our countries and beyond as the start of a new era for Europe. Following the warm welcome that citizens reserved for the euro on the 1st of January 2002 all available information from member states indicates that the retail sector has also passed now successfully to the euro. More than 60 million citizens hold now euro notes and more than 200 million hold euro coins. Progressively the situation should be fully normalised by the end of the second week of January although the coming Saturday will be a real test for the retail sector. Overall the results so far have been positive and on average better than our expectations. The enthusiasm of the European people for their new currency has been the biggest asset in that operation. The meticulous preparations done over the last three years have paid off. This is a success for everybody; the public authorities, the banking sector, the retail sector, ...for all European citizens, ...for the European Union. The euro changeover has proved that European people can work together towards a common goal with resolve and determination. It also shows that diversity works in Europe. Each member state took responsibility for its own changeover arrangements and its own information campaigns but the results have to a large degree been homogenous. The co-ordination done by the European Central Bank and the European Commission proved successful and adequate. However, success to date should not lower our guard. The changeover is not yet over. A lot of work is still needed until every single European citizen, in the cities or in the small village in the country-side, holds euro notes and coins in the quantity and denominations that he or she wants. The logistical operation for withdrawal and destruction of national currency is only starting. Citizens have still to completely adapt to the new unit of account and feel at ease with the converted prices. The Commission will continue its tight monitoring of the euro changeover and work to help all economic actors involved during this period until everything is working to perfection. I would now like to add a few words on the economic situation. It is true that 2001 ended with the European economy suffering from the consequences of the world slow-down. But there is more optimism for 2002. According to our estimates the economic situation will start improving already early in 2002 and growth will accelerate during the year. Our economic polices so far have been well adapted to the challenges posed by the world economic slowdown and the existence of the euro has helped to absorb relatively smoothly the external and internal shocks of last year. Now that the euro is also physically there, it is even more important to strengthen our economic policy co-ordination in order to modernise further our economies. We are in the process of increasing the growth potential of the euro-zone by implementing the Lisbon agenda. A particularly close monitoring of the implementation of structural reforms is necessary in order to come out of the current slow-down even stronger than before. The euro is a strong currency because Europe has a strong economy. Rato: Given the first question, I think that the data we have right now in most of the countries show that there was not a significant increase in prices in the last two weeks of December. And of course, as we have all said in our national press conferences and public opinions, and also in European public opinion, consumers have to be ready to look at prices right now and in any circumstances. But we do not now see any significant data that show there has been a change in the pricing policy of retailers. Solbes: I can only confirm what Mr. Rato has said. It is true that there have been some specific increases. We know this quite well. But if we consider these specific increases as a percentage of the average, they are not very relevant. And as I have said many times, we do not expect a real impact on inflation in January. We do not exclude a certain impact, but not a relevant impact. If I may add a few words to this. It is true, we do not have systemic structured information yet. The information we have is all anecdotal. But it goes in both directions, I must say. Let me give you two examples. There are anecdotes: the Big Mac I bought yesterday evening cost me, together with a strawberry milkshake, EUR 4.45. That was exactly the same amount, when converted, as I paid last week in Deutsche Mark. On the other hand – sorry for ""La Libération"" – when I bought ""Le Figaro"" yesterday, for which I paid FRF 7 last week, I now paid EUR 1, which is a price reduction of almost 7%. So those are the anecdotes we have. The next step in integration? There will be so many steps. I think one of the major challenges is – and this is an integrated effort – to the Spanish presidency, which will place a lot of emphasis in the next half year on further pursuing structural reforms in the European Union. The major longer-term challenge in the process of integration will undoubtedly be the accession of the new Member States and the absorption of the new Member States in the European Union, all leading up to the intergovernmental conference of 2004, by which time probably – as I've said – a sizeable number of new members will enter the Union. I think these are the two major challenges that we face. But the question was political rather than technical or financial. So maybe Mr. Rato.... Rato: I take the chance to ratify what we have said on previous occasions, that the Spanish presidency of the European Union will certainly put a lot of emphasis on structural reform and that I am very positive that all European governments – not only the euro area governments, but all the European governments – are going to work with us to emphasise the need to change the economic situation of Europe, the economic structure of Europe, and to enlarge the possibilities for growth and employment. And as I said in my first words today, the reaction of the public, of the women and men in the streets of Europe, shows that Europeans like changes, economic changes, such as that which the euro represents. Rato: I think that the fact that the European economy needs to enlarge its growth potential is a consensus among public opinion and governments. To increase the pace of change in network industries, to establish clear objectives for the liberalisation of network industries in Europe, to modernise our labour market so as to produce more jobs of a better quality and to adapt those jobs to new economic circumstances brought by the globalisation of markets and also the existence of new technologies, and to achieve a more efficient and more flexible tax system that will allow investment and savings to increase in Europe. The fulfilment of the creation of a financial structure in Europe, financial markets, following the recommendations for instance of the Lamfalussy Report, arriving at agreements with the Parliament, the Commission and the Council in that respect and fulfilling the targets of the financial action plan for the year 2005, those are examples of things that I certainly think deserve that we as members of governments devote as much time as possible to in the next few weeks. Rato: Well, I have to say that I do not agree with your definition of my predecessor's policy. I think that not only Mr. Reynders and myself but the rest of the Eurogroup ministers are very responsible and very clear that the responsibility for monetary policy as stated in the Treaties is the responsibility of the European Central Bank. We are clear that that responsibility should aim at price stability. And, of course, all members of the Eurogroup are fully respectful of those responsibilities and the independence of the European Central Bank. And as for the second aspect of your question, the Eurogroup, with the President of the Commission and the European Central Bank, is the place in which we discuss policy mix. And, of course, we do that every month and that, of course, brings in the position of the European Central Bank and its responsibilities and the position of the governments and their own responsibilities, which are mainly budgetary policies and structural reform policies. And in that respect I think that the compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact by all euro area countries is also a shared policy of the Eurogroup, and I am sure that in the next few months, and probably in the next few years, we will continue and give more emphasis to structural reforms in the areas I have mentioned and in other areas. Rato: I understand that that question is covered by the timetable clearly stated in the Treaties and it is up to the Council to make the decision as to who will take that post. And, of course, as is very normal, countries and governments will speak about that before the moment comes to take the decision. I see only winners. And I heard the statement, he told me about it, and who am I to disagree with my successor?. Rato: Well, I think that the existence of the euro represents the fact that we are all citizens of Europe. We are willing to have not a national monetary policy but a European monetary policy. That is not only a European monetary policy but an independent monetary policy. And that of course is certainly one of the most important structural reforms that has happened in the European economy. So, of course, everything can be looked at from different perspectives but I doubt that there will be another place in the world in which citizens from Finland to Portugal and from Ireland to Italy will have received a new currency with such impetus and such optimism and that, I think, shows clearly that Europeans want economic change at least as deep as the one that the euro represents. "
2002-01-03,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council, Mr. Rato, as well as by Commissioner Solbes. As usual, we examined recent monetary, financial and economic developments. The Governing Council concluded that recent developments are in line with the interest rate decisions taken in the course of last year. We have therefore decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We also confirmed that the current level of key ECB interest rates remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 rose to 7.4% in the period from September to November 2001, from 6.7% in the period from August to October. These high levels of the growth rate of M3 over the past few months reflect a particularly marked preference for liquid holdings by euro area investors in an economic and financial environment characterised by exceptionally high uncertainty worldwide. However, this should remain a temporary phenomenon which does not indicate future inflationary pressures. This judgement notwithstanding, the continued acceleration of M3 and the ongoing process of building up liquidity will require a thorough analysis of monetary developments in the months to come. Regarding the second pillar, recent information has confirmed our earlier assessment that economic activity in the euro area was weak in the second half of 2001 and will probably remain so in early 2002. However, there are signs which point to a gradual recovery in the course of this year, as reflected, for example, in financial market developments or in recent survey data which indicate that the decline in confidence may have bottomed out. There are no fundamental imbalances which would require a longer correction process, and the general positive conditions for an improvement in economic activity remain in place. Financing conditions, in particular, are very favourable, and the expected further decline in consumer price inflation will lead to higher growth in real disposable income which should support domestic demand. All in all, available data remain in line with a recovery of the euro area economy this year, while the timing and strength of this upturn remain uncertain. Continued close monitoring of further incoming information is thus warranted. In the current economic environment we do not expect medium-term upward pressures on inflation. However, as has been stated several times in the past, annual inflation rates for the months to come may be somewhat erratic on account of base effects as a consequence of the unwinding of past increases in energy prices and, albeit to a lesser extent, in food prices. In this connection, the possibility of some short-lived upward movements in the annual rate of inflation cannot be ruled out, but this should not be a cause for concern. Likewise, downward shifts resulting from such base effects later in the spring should not signal a change in the longer-term outlook for price stability. As regards the cash changeover, we do not expect any noticeable effect on the price level, largely due to strong competition in the retail sector, continued awareness on the part of consumers and the commitment of governments not to increase the average level of administered prices; however, we will of course remain vigilant. Beyond short-term developments, we expect that wage moderation in the euro area will continue and that demand pressure on prices will remain subdued, although there are some grounds for concern about forthcoming wage negotiations. It is therefore particularly important to point to the indispensable role of continued wage moderation in fostering employment and maintaining a favourable outlook for price stability. On the basis of current information, annual inflation rates should fall safely below 2% this year and thereafter remain at levels consistent with price stability over the foreseeable future. Any factor which might alter this assessment in either direction will be carefully examined. Let me also stress today how important it is for fiscal policies to maintain a medium-term orientation within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. The current weakness in economic growth undoubtedly presents a particular challenge for those countries which have not yet attained budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus or which have high public debt-to-GDP ratios. However, rather than being detrimental to a return to sustainable economic growth, their adherence to their medium-term objectives will strengthen consumer and investor confidence. Countries without fiscal imbalances can, of course, allow automatic stabilisers to operate fully. That said, however, there is no case for fiscal activism. Finally, I should like to reiterate our views on structural reform – particularly following the successful introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. The key challenge for the euro area, now more than ever, is to continue to strengthen the forces of production and expand the trend output growth of the economy in a decisive manner. This will require a deepening of structural reform in the labour and goods markets, as well as technological innovation. Likewise, governments should pursue determined reforms with regard to the size and structure of public expenditure and revenue, also in order to create room for further tax cuts and to absorb the fiscal costs of population ageing. Together with continued wage moderation aimed at sustaining recent labour market gains, these reforms will foster employment and investment. With the ECB pursuing its primary objective of price stability, with governments willing to foster structural reforms and conduct stability-oriented fiscal policies, and with wage developments consistent with job creation and price stability, the euro – which is now also available in the form of banknotes and coins – will represent an economic area characterised by macroeconomic stability and economic dynamism. We are now at your disposal for questions. Duisenberg. There has been some progress with structural reform. It is certainly not the case that nothing has been done in the past couple of years, but it is certainly not enough. And it has to be continued with force, we hope, and that is also everything that the governments are working towards, especially the Spanish presidency, ahead of the European summit in Barcelona this year. As far as the causes are concerned, the analysis you just gave was recently also given by Mr. Greenspan, who also ascribed the lack of movement in the exchange rate to the far lower degree of flexibility in the economy of Europe as compared with the United States and, as usual, I happen to agree with him. Duisenberg. I will not speculate further. I am here to fight speculation rather than to add to it. But certainly the movement of the past couple of days was, well, to say the least, gratifying to see. Duisenberg. I have also learnt never to talk again about intervention until after the event. So I won't do that today either. Duisenberg. The last parts of the question will undoubtedly be answered by Mr. Noyer. The use of the euro as an international reserve currency is increasing, but very slowly. And it was expected to be very slow, but increasingly we are getting signals that countries, especially central banks of countries, are beginning to realise the possibilities they now have to diversify their reserve holdings. But it is not something we are aiming for, we will just let it happen. But it is happening, and the fact that, for example, in the recent experiences of the cash changeover, we have frontloaded to more than 20 non-euro area central banks sizeable sums, billions and billions worth of euro banknotes, is already an indication of this. The fact also that in the eastern hemisphere, where we are, more than 50 countries, in one way or the other, link their currency or align their currency to the euro is also a telling aspect of the phenomenon. But I don't want to ask Mr. Noyer to speculate about the ""when"", precisely if I assume he knows as much as I do. Noyer: Certainly, I do not know more than you do. But I can just confirm that this move that we expect is not an objective per se, but that what we expect to happen will probably take place in all fields. We have seen that already in the field of the debt market, where euro issues are now broadly comparable with issues in US dollars. We have seen slow shifts in the portfolio managed by international managers, both in the debt instruments and equity, around, let's say, one-quarter of internationally managed portfolio now. There is a clear consolidation, as the President just mentioned, in terms of using the euro as a reference currency, for pegging, as a central element of a basket, etc. In the field of official foreign exchange reserves, that develops very slowly. Of course, the figures are difficult to interpret because very often the comparison which is given is between the figures of official reserves of the European currencies before 1 January 1999 and after. And before 1 January 1999, all European central banks – euro area central banks, I mean – had European currencies in their foreign exchange reserves. And then the Deutsche Mark or the Dutch guilders or French francs disappeared to become internal currencies. So that in terms of the word ""reserves"", the share of the dollar increased simply because the European currencies disappeared from the European reserves, and of course this blurs the view of developments. But I was in Beijing myself on the day the Vice-Governor of the central bank of China, the People's Bank of China, announced that they had decided to increase their reserves in euro. I think that is a movement that is quite natural given the importance of the euro area in terms of world trade. But that will happen if and when the countries and central banks deem it appropriate. I am personally sure that it will develop, perhaps slowly, we will see. And for your final question on invoices and settlements, well, we will see. It took decades for the US dollar to overcome the importance of the pound sterling, long after the US economy had become much more important than the British economy. That is something that simply takes a very long time to develop. To take the last question first, I would think that they were neutral and we do regard the current monetary policy stance as appropriate for the foreseeable future, which is the same thing again. Consumer behaviour, we only have anecdotal evidence, but the anecdotal evidence we have is that the time up until the cash changeover or up until Christmas was a very good time for the retail sector. I would not see a direct link there. I would see much more the link between the falling of the inflation, thereby the boost to real purchasing power which will make consumption one of the driving forces in the upturn, be it a slow upturn of the European economy. These pieces of evidence you just mentioned are better than my expectations. We expect a recovery to get under way in the course of this year. But we are still very uncertain about the precise timing and we also think that it will be a very gradual process, as I said in my introduction. Contrary to what you seem to indicate, we expect the first quarter of this year, in which we now are, to be pretty much the same as the last two quarters of last year. No, I do not want to point to individual trade unions, however large they may be. But there is some concern. Well, it is a fact, be it satisfactory or not, but I said that last year would relate to what will be happening this year, so I have not been disappointed so far. How confident am I? I would like to say: pretty confident, but there is a risk and that is that we are quite uncertain about the external developments, in particular in the United States. There is simply uncertainty around and that does put a downward risk on my confidence. We have developed in Europe a structure of a dialogue between the monetary authorities and the fiscal and economic policy authorities through our dialogue in the Eurogroup, in the ECOFIN, through the presence of – like you have seen today – the President of ECOFIN in the meetings of the Governing Council which, given the circumstances, is – I am inclined to say – a very good substitute for having one government. Well, really there are similarities to when the euro was created on 1 January 1999. That moment was preceded by an upward move of the exchange rate which maybe was somewhat overstating and it has proven to be somewhat overstating the ""europhoria"" that governed at that time. So it was no surprise at all that soon after the creation of the euro, it came down again. And that is where the similarities stop because I would be surprised if we saw a similar movement now. And what has happened to the exchange rate in the last couple of days, it is only a couple of days, but at least it is going in the direction which we always have said that the euro had the potential for, namely to appreciate. "
