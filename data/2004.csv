2004-12-02,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. All in all, the short-term outlook for inflation remains worrisome, but our assessment of price developments over the medium term is unchanged. At the current juncture oil price developments are having a sizeable impact on consumer prices in the euro area, while there is no significant evidence that stronger underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their historically low levels. At the same time, we recognise the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Continued vigilance is of the essence with regard to those risks. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. After the positive developments in the first half of 2004, economic growth has moderated in the second half. In the third quarter of the year, real GDP growth is estimated to have been only 0.3% quarter on quarter, after 0.7% and 0.5% in the previous two quarters. According to Eurostat, the contribution of net exports turned negative, reflecting in particular high import growth, and private consumption was subdued, probably dampened by higher oil prices. At the same time, investment growth increased and inventories were built up. The available survey information for October and November points to ongoing growth in the fourth quarter, albeit at a more moderate pace than in the first half of this year. The conditions remain in place for economic growth to proceed. On the external side, while global growth is showing some signs of moderation, it nonetheless is expected to remain robust. Euro area exports should continue to benefit from global demand conditions. On the domestic side, investment should be supported further by the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area, improved earnings and greater corporate efficiency gained through business restructuring. Finally, scope exists for private consumption to strengthen, particularly if uncertainties surrounding the extent and pace of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms are reduced. Accordingly, we expect a gradual recovery in euro area activity over the next two years, with somewhat more moderate growth rates due to the impact of oil prices. This is also reflected in the Eurosystem staff projections. Euro area real GDP growth is projected to be between 1.6% and 2.0% on average in 2004, between 1.4% and 2.4% in 2005 and between 1.7% and 2.7% in 2006. Available forecasts from international and private sector organisations convey a broadly similar picture. Downside risks to these projections stem in particular from potentially unfavourable developments in the oil market. In order to limit such risks, second-round effects in wage and price-setting must be avoided and fiscal authorities should refrain from taking measures which would prolong or distort the necessary adjustment process. Moreover, the degree of competition in the euro area energy sector is an important factor in allowing higher oil prices to be absorbed without significant distortions. Further progress in increasing competition in this sector would be highly beneficial. Turning to consumer prices, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in November, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, down from 2.4% in October. Over the coming months, inflation rates of above 2% are likely to persist, and some temporary further increase from current levels cannot be excluded. Looking further ahead, however, the information available so far indicates that HICP inflation would fall below 2% in the course of 2005 if no further adverse shocks occurred and it does not suggest that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of ongoing moderate growth and weak labour markets, this trend should continue in the future. Producer prices are rising, but this remains concentrated on energy and intermediate goods, which should limit the pass-through. These views are also embodied in the Eurosystem staff projections. Average annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2004. As the impact of recent oil price increases and the effects of previous indirect tax and administered price rises gradually dissipate, annual HICP inflation is projected to be between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2005 and 1.0% and 2.2% in 2006. These projections are broadly consistent with forecasts recently released by international and private sector organisations. Several upside risks need to be taken into account. Concerns relate in particular to future oil price developments and, more generally, to the potential risk of second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. Further developments in indirect taxes and administered prices also need to be monitored closely. Further insight into the outlook for price developments, at medium to longer-term horizons, is provided by the monetary analysis. The latest monetary data confirm that the downward trend in annual M3 growth observed from the middle of 2003 has not continued in recent months and has even reversed. Over the course of 2004, monetary dynamics have been driven by two opposing forces. On the one hand, the historically very low level of interest rates in the euro area has stimulated M3 dynamics, in particular demand for the most liquid components of M3 contained in the narrow aggregate M1. On the other hand, portfolio allocation behaviour has tended to normalise over the past year following the exceptionally strong preference for liquidity observed during the period of heightened economic and financial uncertainty between 2001 and mid-2003. However, investors’ preference for liquid assets seems to have remained greater than would typically be expected at the current stage of the economic cycle, possibly due to the fact that the economic and financial uncertainties in recent years have been relatively strong and protracted. The very low level of interest rates is also fuelling private sector demand for credit. In particular, the demand for loans for house purchase has continued to be robust, supported also by strong house price dynamics in several euro area countries. Growth in loans to non-financial corporations has picked up further in recent months. As a result of the persistently high growth in M3 over the past few years, there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary economic growth. This could pose risks to price stability over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures are contained, but a number of medium-term upside risks to price stability need to be monitored closely. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term. It is of the essence to avoid any spillover from short-term consumer price developments to long-term inflation expectations. As regards fiscal policies, forthcoming budgets and stability programmes should send strong and confidence-building signals, namely that sound public finances and growth-friendly structural adjustments in public finances are being pursued. Concerning the European institutional framework, the Stability and Growth Pact and the excessive deficit procedure are the key fiscal cornerstones of EMU. These must remain firm. The Pact and the excessive deficit procedure should be fully respected in their current form, while their implementation could be improved, in particular as regards the preventive arm of the Pact. Finally, let me support the calls expressed in the report of the High Level Group chaired by Wim Kok to renew the impetus in the Lisbon process and to sharpen its focus. In this context, we restate our strong support for all efforts on the part of governments, parliaments and social partners implementing the reform agenda and focusing on those reforms that will support employment growth, foster investment and stimulate innovation and productivity. Progress in this direction will not only enhance the underlying growth potential of the euro area economy over the medium term but will also help to bolster consumer and business confidence over a shorter horizon. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * Well, first of all, I would confirm what you know, namely that we consider recent moves as unwelcome. And, as regards intervention, you know also that I never comment on such matters. I will only add that we are taking into our analysis, of course, all elements that are part of our analysis and, of course, we have taken into account all that we know on the domestic development in the euro area, on the evolution of labour costs, on the impact of the price of oil, on the impact of exchange rate, and so forth. We have, as you know, a totally comprehensive vision. And, again, we are clearly saying: recent moves are unwelcome. I would only add that “verbal discipline” in the present time is really of the essence. It speaks for itself. As you know, the English language comes partly from the Anglo-Normand and you could say that it is the Anglo-Normand style. I expected that question. As you know, we have a needle in our compass. The needle of the compass is price stability. And we take all pertinent information into account, including the evolution of domestic demand, the evolution of the economy and all other elements, as part of our own judgement of the risks to price stability, both through the economic analysis and through the monetary analysis. The conclusions that we draw determine our monetary policy. So, we take absolutely everything into account. No, there is a full consensus on what I have just said. And I am speaking here on behalf of the Governing Council and not in my personal capacity. I am reporting as the spokesperson of the Governing Council. The Governing Council is unanimous in saying that recent moves are unwelcome. And we fully take into account all parameters in our own analysis – both the economic analysis and the monetary analysis. All this is fully taken into account. And if you want details on the deliberations of the Governing Council, I would sum it up in the following fashion: we did not consider at all the option of decreasing rates; we assessed the situation; and we concluded that maintaining the present rates was the correct decision, taking everything into account, and that continued vigilance was of the essence.. Because our vigilance is essential to our credibility. Because our credibility is essential to anchoring inflation expectations. And because solidly anchoring inflation expectations in line with our definition of price stability is key in the present episode, where we have various shocks, including the oil shock which is an important feature in the present environment. On the first point, it goes without saying intervention is a weapon that exists, and it has existed, historically, in all major partner countries. And I confirm to you that I never comment on such matters. I understand the second question as a call for a judgement on the global demand addressed to the euro area? Is that right? Again, we have to take into account the full body of the 306 million citizens of the euro area and we have to take into account the full body of the 12 economies concerned. They are not in exactly the same situation as regards a number of parameters. And for very good reasons: we can explain of course what comes from the reunification in Germany, what would come from the specialisation of the various economies, what would come from decisions taken in the past and so forth. We have a global vision, and, as I said, we consider that global growth will remain robust. We can expect global demand – which is the external demand addressed to the euro area – to continue to be part of an environment which is favourable, even though we have observed some moderation. We have had, as you know, a global economy which was picking up very, very impressively. So, we see now some moderation but a continuation of global growth at a robust pace, which is of course a favourable environment in this respect. As regards the first remark, it is a general remark which is not addressed to any particular audience or constituency. I made it in front of you and after the first question of this press briefing. As regards what I said on exchange rates, I will stick to this sentence, which speaks for itself. I have already responded to part of your question. I said that we did not examine cutting interest rates. We examined the other options, and our conclusion – which was a very, very broad conclusion – was that interest rates were correct at the moment and that continued vigilance was of the essence. Vigilance is the driving force behind credibility. Credibility is the driving force to ensure inflation expectations remain in line with our definition of price stability. And if inflation expectations remain in line with price stability, this paves the way for no second-round effects, for all economic agents to make the assumption that in the medium run we will be in line with price stability, and for a financial environment which is extremely favourable. Obviously, for the 306 million inhabitants of the euro area, it is the best financial environment we have had in nominal terms since the Second World War. It is precisely the reason why we have to remain vigilant and why I insist on vigilance being of the essence. Some indications we have are confirming that we are around the level of 1.9%, below 2%, close to 2%. You probably refer partly to what we extract from index bonds and the extraction from index bonds gives figures that are a little bit over and above 2%, and this is something that we have to examine very carefully. There are various ways to analyse this situation. Some are arguing that a part of it is due to risk premia on top of inflation expectations that would justify the fact that we remain a little bit below 2% for the sole inflation expectations. I do not express a definitive opinion on this. I would say all the information we have is calling for vigilance to be of the essence. I will not embark on a “hit parade” of the uncertainties in which we are living, we ourselves in the Governing Council of the ECB and also at the level of all responsible entities, not only in Europe but all over the world. So, it is clear that the oil price is an uncertainty that we have to take into account. As you could see, as regards the projections of the staff of the Eurosystem, this has been taken into account at a certain level which is the working assumption. It is absolutely clear that it could go up or down. As you know, as member of the international community, we are calling for oil markets to function as well as possible and for this price to go down and we are strongly calling for that. I myself signed the G7 communiqué, which is calling for that and we trust that the present level does not reflect fully the normal price which would come out of the normal “encounter” of supply and demand, but again: we have to be realistic, we have to be entirely attached to facts and figures, and we take the reality as it is. And it is true that we are living in an uncertain world. As everybody can see, we are also living in an uncertain world as regards a number of other parameters, of course exchange rates, of course the overall attitude of authorities that are responsible for structural reforms, that are responsible for fiscal policies. We are also very much depending on the global evolution. We have an idea of the global evolution, but there are risks at the global level that we have to take into account. I do not make a “hit parade” of risks but we have to continue, as we have been until now, to be an “anchor of stability”. It is our own responsibility. We have to be an anchor of stability that would not only be stable for today or tomorrow but also in the medium and long run. Do not forget that we have treasury issuance with a 30-year duration: they rely upon our very long-term credibility in delivering price stability. We have to be such an anchor in an environment which is obviously uncertain, and which is changing. You see that the working assumptions of the present Eurosystem staff projections are different from the working assumptions of the previous projections that we published three months ago, only because the environment changes. We must remain the anchor in an environment which is changing. I said that two other options had been examined. We concluded – with a very, very large consensus – that the present rates were correct. And that vigilance was of the essence. That was a very good try. I do not want to bore everybody by repeating for the third time a sentence that you know pretty well. But thank you very much nevertheless for your question. First of all, I will say that we have a position at the level of the Governing Council on this question of facts and figures. We said very clearly – and we were echoing the sentiments of the ECOFIN Council – that we need independent institutions for the application of accounting rules and for the collection of facts and figures at the level of the various nations. We need a capacity at the centre – namely the European Commission, Eurostat and the Commission – to check facts and figures, I would say examining the dossiers, and also on the spot. We need a system that ensures that when a figure has been stamped, it cannot be changed. If the referee has said this or that, it cannot be changed. That is extremely important, but of course, it can only be done if the other two conditions are fully met and we expect the Commission to make very precise proposals in this domain. And I can tell you that the Governing Council certainly feels that this is very important. Lucas, would you like to add a word on this issue? Papademos: The report of the Commission I think, speaks for itself, and the Commission has issued a communication. I would derive a number of general conclusions from this report, very much in line with what the President said. The first is that it is very important that the weaknesses and insufficiencies in the provision of budget deficit figures are addressed effectively. It is essential that we have complete and reliable data in order to be able to apply the excessive deficit procedure and to evaluate the convergence of Member States. For that reason, we must learn from past experience in order to ensure that the kind of problems that have been identified do not occur again. And to this end a number of measures can be taken. As the President noted, I think it is important, among other things, to enhance the professional capacity, the effectiveness and the independence of national statistical offices, and also to further strengthen the monitoring and inspection capacity of Eurostat. Thank you very much. So, the sooner, the better. What Lucas could not necessarily say but what I will say is that, when I look at the report of the Bank of Greece for the time in question, I see that the Bank of Greece had reported both the deficit figures based on “delivery” (national accounting) – we are entering into technicalities here – and the figures based on “cash payments”. And the figures based on cash payments were clearly very different. It was not the duty of the Bank of Greece to decide what the right accounting procedure was, but the figures – as far as I understand it, after having read it – were clearly there. I mention that en passant. That is not the problem, the problem is to have a system which will function impeccably. That is what we are calling for, and I am sure that the Commission will propose a good system and that the Council will approve it. The Council itself – and we fully approve of this – said that “we should not be dependent on electoral cycles or political influence”. This is clear, it has been said by the ministers themselves, and we fully subscribe to it. I did not mention that at all. No, please do not ask me to repeat for the fourth time the same sentence. I did not say “strong dollar”. If you absolutely want me to say that word, then I would say that I appreciate what John Snow has said as regards this particular point. I also appreciate very much what he has said regarding the necessity and the will of the US government to correct a lack of savings which is materialising in particular through public dissavings. Everything that the US government and John Snow have said in this regard is important. I would say that to echo your question. It was very important that the US government was committing itself to correct these fiscal imbalances. That is exactly what I said, and I think that you will fully subscribe to that. But I understand pretty well your own judgement and appreciation. I should also mention the fact that we have a consensus on the diagnosis on the assets and liabilities of our economies on both sides of the Atlantic. On both sides of the Atlantic, we have assets and liabilities and we – by which I mean the G7, including the European Union and the ECB – all agree on that. We agree that the main asset of the United States is the flexibility of the economy. And the fact that structural reforms have been implemented and are giving the economy a high level of growth potential and the capacity to be resilient to shocks is something which is remarkable. That is the asset. The liability is an important lack of savings, and there is a consensus on that. A correction of this lack of savings involves correcting public dissavings and this is what the US government has said. I myself have no reason to immediately question what they will do. In this sense, you are right: we will see what they will do. But I approve what they say. And I do not hesitate to say that – on this side of the Atlantic – we also have our homework to do. We all agree that here in Europe we do not have a lack of savings; we have a slight surplus of savings, which is reflected in a slight surplus of the current account. It is an important asset. But we have a big liability, namely a lack of structural reforms. I do not want to bore you, but we agree also that this lack of structural reforms creates two problems, reverse problems in comparison with the United States: we have a lower level of growth potential and we are less resilient to shocks. These are big problems and we have to correct them. That is our homework. So, we both have homework to do and we both agree on that. But I also agree entirely with you: now we have to deliver on both sides of the Atlantic. I have just said that there is a joint consensus on the main assets and liabilities on both sides of the Atlantic. I expect that we will continue to have a confident relationship. As you know, when we clarified our monetary policy concept, which was done in 2003, we said that the reference value of 4.5%, which of course exists, was a medium-term reference value, so we would not reassess the reference value every year. If there was a revision every year, this would not be in line with the idea that it was a medium-term reference value. So, it is in place, and we regularly calculate the monetary gap with reference to our reference value. Perhaps you have noted that in what I have said today in my introductory remarks there are four paragraphs that concern our understanding of what is happening on the monetary side. We attach great importance to our monetary analysis. We believe that it is one of the main tools that we have to anchor medium and long-term inflation expectations. We in the Governing Council of the ECB believe that in the long term inflation is a monetary phenomenon and we have the impression that this is also regarded by academics and by observers in general as something which is very important. We are proud of our monetary policy concept and we consider that it has to be examined very carefully. And, as I have said, we are looking at the monetary gap that we are experiencing and we are trying to gain a better understanding of a phenomenon which I mentioned earlier, namely the fact that the portfolio shifts observed previously have not reversed, in our opinion, in the way that they normally could do or should do at this point in the cycle. This is a matter for further reflection. It is an important matter. We discuss such matters at length. Each of us weighs up all the pros and cons for the various possible decisions that we could take. This is true also for non-monetary policy decisions. I am interpreting the weight of the pros and the weight of the cons but I am not giving you a proportion. It is my belief that everything is taken into account. Each of us admits that there were pros and cons, and the result is – as I said – a large consensus. I know that some of you want to have a sense of the meeting and that is why I want to give you a sense of the meeting. I will sum it up again: interest rates are correct and vigilance is of the essence. And this is true for all the reasons I have mentioned, including those relating to monetary developments. "
2004-11-04,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Persistently high and rising oil prices have had a visible direct impact on consumer prices this year, and inflation is likely to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months. This is a worrisome development, but there is no strong indication as yet that medium-term inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. In particular, wage growth appears to remain limited, in the context of ongoing moderate real GDP growth and weak labour markets. Against this background, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their present levels, which are very low by historical standards. However, there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Strong vigilance is therefore warranted with regard to all developments which could increase such risks. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. The economic recovery started in the second half of 2003, and we saw positive developments in the first half of 2004. Although short-term indicators have become more mixed, the basic determinants of economic activity remain consistent with continuing economic growth in 2005. On the external side, we see some moderation taking place following a period in which the world economy has experienced its strongest dynamism in many years. Nevertheless, euro area exports should continue to benefit from positive global demand conditions in 2005. On the domestic side, investment should be supported by the global environment, the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area, improved earnings and greater corporate efficiency gained through business restructuring. Furthermore, scope exists in the euro area as a whole for private consumption to strengthen, particularly once labour market prospects improve more visibly. However, this outlook is surrounded by continuing uncertainty, in particular stemming from recent developments in oil markets. On the one hand, the magnitude and nature of this shock differ from earlier experiences, when oil price rises were much stronger and mainly due to supply constraints. In addition, the oil intensity of production is significantly lower in the euro area. On the other hand, recent oil price increases constitute a nonetheless sizeable adverse shock to the euro area economy. If oil prices were to remain at current levels, or even increase further, they would dampen the strength of the recovery both inside and outside the euro area. Under certain conditions, a smoother absorption of the oil price shock can be ensured: in particular, second-round effects in wage and price-setting must continue to be avoided, and fiscal authorities should refrain from taking measures which would prolong the necessary adjustment process. With regard to consumer prices, annual inflation increased to 2.5% in October, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. This was a strong increase, after the decline to 2.1% in September from 2.3% in August, and shows that oil price developments have had a sizeable direct impact on the euro area HICP in recent weeks. Moreover, the oil price shock may feed through the economy and generate further indirect effects, as indicated by developments in producer prices. Looking further ahead, however, the information available so far does not suggest that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Wage increases have remained limited since the last quarter of 2003, and this trend is expected to persist in the context of ongoing moderate growth and weak labour markets. Nevertheless, a number of upward risks to the outlook for price stability have emerged over recent months. Risks are mainly associated with oil price developments, possible renewed increases in indirect taxes and administrative prices, and potential second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting behaviour. Further indications for the medium-term outlook are provided by the monetary analysis. The downward trend in annual M3 growth in the first half of this year appears to have come to a halt in recent months. The shorter-term dynamics of M3 have strengthened and its annual growth rates are rising. These developments reflect the stimulative effect of the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area on monetary expansion. Demand for the most liquid components of M3 contained in the narrow aggregate M1 is particularly strong. The low level of interest rates is also fuelling private sector demand for credit. In particular, the growth rate of loans for house purchase continues to rise and is now approaching double digits. Yet loan demand is becoming more broadly based, and the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations is also picking up. Given the continued strength of M3 growth over the past few years, there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. This could pose inflationary risks in the future if the excess liquidity is not progressively reduced as a result of reverse portfolio shifts. Moreover, persistently high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could become a source of unsustainable asset price increases, particularly in property markets. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying inflationary pressures are still contained, but a number of medium-term upside risks to price stability need to be monitored closely. It is particularly important that these do not affect long-term inflation expectations. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis continues to support the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability. I would now like to make a few remarks on fiscal policies. Most countries have presented their budget plans for 2005. In some cases there are encouraging signs that Member States are planning to correct excessive deficits or make progress towards close-to-balance or in-surplus budgetary positions. However, there are other cases where there are significant risks that commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact will not be met, or where imbalances are on the rise and new breaches of the 3% reference value might occur. It is therefore imperative that 2005 budgets prioritise consolidation where this is necessary. Moreover, it is of vital importance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics are ensured. Appropriate budgetary targets and compliance with fiscal commitments and reporting requirements will help to build confidence, support the economic upswing and prepare for the impact of population ageing. As regards the European fiscal framework, the Governing Council remains convinced that improvements in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact are possible and would be beneficial. In this regard, the European Commission’s proposals for improving the implementation of the preventive arm of the Pact are useful. At the same time, the Governing Council warns against changes to the Pact and, in particular, the excessive deficit procedure. It considers the credibility of the 3% deficit limit essential to anchoring expectations of fiscal discipline. Moreover, strict surveillance and effective peer pressure on national budget policies are indispensable to preserving sound fiscal policies. Finally, I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate the need for progress on structural reform. Fiscal consolidation plans should be part of a structural reform agenda that favours growth, competitiveness and employment. As regards labour and product markets, the mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda – now being prepared for the European Council meeting in March 2005 – is a major opportunity to increase momentum in these fields. Structural reforms are crucial to a better performing EU economy, i.e. an economy with higher potential growth, more employment opportunities and greater resilience to shocks. Efforts to accelerate key economic reforms are now more important than ever. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * My colleagues and I discussed that first question a lot today. Each of us participated in the discussion and we weighed up the balance of risks to price stability. You know that the needle of our compass is price stability. And we incorporate absolutely all elements, including, of course, our judgement on the strength of the economy as regards its impact on this needle of the compass of price stability. We had a lot of views. The weight of the upward risks to price stability was assessed. It is clear that we see these upside risks to price stability augmenting. That is absolutely clear. And it is the reason why we consider the posture of strong vigilance to be the appropriate posture, strong vigilance to clearly communicate to all economic agents that we will not let secondary effects materialise. We are there to ensure that there are no secondary effects. And that is the message of today’s Governing Council. On the exchange rates I would only say that we all signed the Washington communiqué: the Secretary of the US Treasury and the President of the Federal Reserve System, as well as European counterparts, including myself. It captures the present sentiment of the G7 community. Thus we all signed, and I signed in particular, the sentence stating that “excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth”. I would also mention that I read with great interest the reiteration a few days ago by the Secretary of the US Treasury that the policy of the United States in this respect remains the policy of a strong dollar. Almost one year ago I said that excess volatility and disorderly movements on exchange markets were undesirable. That was then captured in the Boca Raton communiqué and in the following G7 communiqué of Washington that I was just quoting in response to the previous question. But there is a continuity in this sentiment. I told you that I stick to what I said on excess volatility. This is a continuous position, a long-standing position. In reply to your first question, we will publish our new projections as you know in a month’s time and then you will know what the new staff projections are. At the present time, I would say that what is clear to me is that the present pick-up of the CPI which we are observing will continue for some months and will perhaps even increase. So I warn you that there is the likelihood, as far as we understand the consequences and, I would say, the passing-through of the oil price impact that we will probably see. So that is very clear and I warn you in advance. Then, it will continue for some months next year and then we think that at a certain moment we will go back down to our definition of price stability. The passing-through of this oil shock will take place over time, but of course will not be permanent. I remain very prudent and cautious and I will not respond to the question on the average of next year. It depends so much on the oil price itself and what is likely or unlikely to happen and I don’t want to make any projections. The working assumption when I was mentioning the profile that I had in mind is that the price of oil would remain at the same level. You know that in the same G7 meeting that I was mentioning, we also called for appropriate conditions for a decrease in the price of oil and it is our sentiment that the present level is not in line with what would be advisable in all respects. So we will see what happens, but we strive to get a more appropriate – I would say – supply and demand “encounter” in order to have prices that would be lower and more in line with what is desirable for the global economy. In reply to your second question, it is absolutely clear that under a working assumption that the price of oil remains at the present level and may even rise further, which is a possibility that we hate but that we have mentioned, clearly the impact on inflation is upward and the impact on growth is downward. So under this assumption it is absolutely clear that downward risks for growth are there and are rising. That is absolutely clear and I would say that in some respects it is an arithmetic consequence of the transfer of revenue associated with the pick-up in the price of oil from oil-consuming economies to oil-producing economies. That is absolutely clear. On the first question, I am very clear and I don’t want to repeat again the fact that excessive volatility and disorderly moves in the exchange markets are undesirable. I said that and I repeat that and I say it so clearly that I take it that there is no need to repeat it again. On house loans, we have mentioned in a number of recent meetings of the Governing Council that when we analyse the counterparts of M3, we see credit to the economy which is quite dynamic. Within this, credit to households is pretty dynamic and is now close to two-digit figures. It is also clear that we are observing in certain economies, not in all economies and certainly not in our economy as a whole, a phenomenon of asset inflation in the real estate sector which has to be examined very carefully. But again it is not a phenomenon that we are observing in the euro area as a whole, only in a number of economies. On the dollar I already said what I had to say if you permit me. On the twin deficits it’s absolutely clear that the unanimous sentiment of the Governing Council is that we have a lack of savings in the US. We don’t disagree with the US on that. As you know, it is a joint diagnosis which is made by both our US friends and ourselves that there is a lack of savings in the US. The correction of this lack of savings is, I would say, the “homework” of the US, while we have our own homework, which is structural reforms and making our economy more flexible and more resilient. On both sides of the Atlantic we have assets and liabilities and we all agree on these: our own assets are that we are balanced and we are financing our own investment with our own savings, while the US is not; by contrast, the assets of the US are that they have a very flexible and a very resilient economy and I would say they are permanently proving that in the present conditions of the global economy. So, all that being said, in our own analysis it is very important that the US progressively, but I also would say efficiently and effectively, correct this lack of savings, which would of course reduce the domestic and external imbalances per se. We agree on that, the problem is the delivery on both sides of the Atlantic. Well, I will certainly not interpret the position of the Chinese authorities. I would only say that one of the issues which is at stake in China, as far as I understand it, is the cooling down of some abnormally buoyant features in the economy. Until this most recent decision, most of the measures taken were administrative measures – instructions or directions given to a variety of economic agents or banks – and it is certainly appropriate that market economy weapons should be utilised to move towards increased control of the cycle in the Chinese economy, so the decision is certainly opportune from that point of view. I will not elaborate on whether or not it announces anything else, you might ask the Governor of the Bank of China and the Chinese authorities. I would only say and confirm that there is a consensus in the G7 communiqué to signal that some currencies – not the particular currency that we are talking about here, i.e. the Chinese currency, but a number of currencies in Asia – could certainly be allowed to appreciate, to some extent, by market forces, in a progressive, orderly and smooth fashion, which is not the case today. So, I am not saying anything that has not already been said in the Boca Raton communiqué and then in the two subsequent Washington communiqués. These questions are, of course, at the heart of our own diagnosis and understanding of what our duty is. It is absolutely clear – as I said a moment ago – that when you have an oil shock or when you have a commodity shock it has a direct impact – an arithmetic, mathematical direct impact – on growth, which is depressive, and on inflation, which pushes inflation up. The figures, the equations are there. Then, our duty is to ensure that there is no long-lasting effect on inflation. It is our duty; we are there to ensure price stability; we are there to deliver price stability; we are there to permit all economic agents to make the working assumption that price stability will be delivered over time – not just, as I used to say, on a two-year or a five-year basis, but on a ten-year or even a 30-year basis, because a number of Treasuries are issuing Treasury bonds on a 30-year basis. So, we have to deliver that and we have to take the measures that are appropriate for that and we have to be credible in delivering that price stability over time. So, the problem of the second-round effects is of course crucial. If you have no second-round effects, then you have the hump which goes with the effects of the price of oil, which materialises of course in the figures. But after a certain period of time it disappears and you are back to your definition of price stability. And that is the reason why I insist so much that what is decisive for us is the avoidance of second-round effects. And these second-round effects are multiple. You have, of course, the spiralling of wages and salaries. We have mentioned that this is very important, because of the subsequent impact on unit labour costs and on inflation. That is one of the key elements and is extremely important. Another element is, of course, inflationary expectations. If economic agents’ inflationary expectations are solidly anchored in line with our definition of price stability, there is no reason why, in the price-setting mechanisms – the numerous price-setting mechanisms that you have in the market economy – we should see a permanent increase in inflation. If you are not credible in delivering price stability and inflationary expectations increase, then you might see a generalisation of those second-round effects. That is the reason why we are communicating with regard to those second-round effects, why we say that, for us, they are crucial, and why we say that we are in a strong vigilance posture. We have to be ready to prevent these secondary effects, which would, of course, for all reasons be totally contrary to what we are required to deliver as a central bank, but which would also have a direct impact on the yield curve of the euro area and would immediately push up the medium and long-term market rates. The medium and long-term market rates would immediately incorporate the addition of basis points on top of the definition of price stability to incorporate the inflationary expectations, which would increase in the presence of second-round effects. So, it is very important, for all reasons, that we do not have second-round effects and that we maintain inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability. We have regular meetings with trade unions at the European level. It is part of the European framework of communication. We can exchange views and we explain to them what we are doing – exactly as we explain what we are doing to the European Parliament and, through you, to the full body of public opinion in Europe. And they explain to us how they see things. So, it is a very important way of communicating, and we are very keen on communicating. We also communicate with the social partners in general – the entrepreneurs – not only the unions as, in decentralised, market economies, the social partners play a very important role. Economic agents in general play – on a decentralised basis – a very important role. On the second question I will be very clear: the terms “excessive volatility” and “disorderly movements” speak for themselves. And I say that again, one year ago I signed up to that, and I have repeated it again today very clearly. On the first question: the euro area economy comprises a number of economies, and what is observed in some economies is not necessarily in line with what we observe at the euro area level. Take the German economy, for instance, which is a very important economy in the euro area. Until now we have observed unit labour costs and nominal increases in wages and salaries that were very moderate. These developments were in line with the need for the German economy to catch up in terms of cost competitiveness and to take account of the fact that reunification has had a general impact on costs in Germany. So, in the case of Germany there is a special element of “slow motion” with unit labour costs that is fully in line with what is necessary. For the rest of Europe and for Europe as a whole, we consider that it is extremely important to monitor what is happening in terms of wage developments and unit labour costs. We do not have the feeling that we are observing, very fortunately, at the present moment what I would call secondary effects – those effects that we want to counter. But we have to remain vigilant. On top of that, I would say that we have to remain strongly vigilant, which is why we use the expression “strong vigilance”. On the second question I would say that we are in constant contact with our friends across the Atlantic. I have not had contact since the election. But that is only a question of hasard, this has just happened by chance, because we have contacts on a permanent basis. And we have a level of mutual confidence that – I trust – is very strong. On China I would say that what is good for the Chinese economy – and I take it that these developments are good for the Chinese economy – would certainly be good also for the global economy and for all economies in the world. We have a joint interest in both our economies for this to be managed as well as possible. No, at this stage that is certainly not our analysis. First of all, because we are “there” as regards inflation and, as I have already said, we are strongly vigilant and – and this is a reason why we did not increase rates today – we take it that the situation, the overall balance of risks to price stability, is such that we have the maintenance of price stability over time in hand. As regards the impact on growth: there is an impact on growth, as I mentioned in response to previous questions. But we would certainly confirm at the present moment and on the basis of all the information we have that, even if the impact is negative on growth, it is not driving us to a situation where we would be in stagnation. And our analysis is that we will continue to see growth close to our growth potential in the euro area as a whole. And that is not only our own analysis – it is an analysis which is shared by all international observers and international institutions. It is a job which is very, very impressive I have to say. It is not harder than I thought, but one discovers Europe and the world through a different angle. So, it is extraordinarily challenging. The Vice-President and I have the privilege to be the leaders of various teams, and the team spirit is very, very profound in central banking. We know that we have to have the same values, the same way of looking at all the challenges we face. So with the team which is the Executive Board, we have a particular responsibility to run this house, and also with the full body of this very, very impressive team, which is the Eurosystem. Delivering the currency for 306 million people, even more than in the United States, is quite a responsibility. And, since we have no role model, we do that in a way which has never been done before: with the ECB, the national central banks – the full body of the team – deciding on monetary policy here and then implementing it in the various economies. All this is extremely challenging. Also, the fact that we have more than 25 nationalities in this institution, where cross-fertilisation is of the essence, is something which is also very striking. This is history in the making: the fact that we are 12 countries today, but we know in advance that we will be many more tomorrow; the fact that we started European integration with six but now are 25. The lesson I draw from all that is that history moves faster, much faster than we think. We negotiated and worded the Maastricht Treaty when we were 12. The idea that we would have to implement it with 25 or 28, or even more, was not at all in our minds. We underestimated the rapidity of the historical changes. And I know now that the worst thing to do is to underestimate the rapidity of historical changes. You are in an institution where history is in the making. And that is, of course, very, very impressive. On the one-off measures I would say that, as a general rule, we do not like one-off measures, because they are not recurrent by definition. And so, you might imagine that you have solved the problem for your first year, but then with your second, your third, your fourth, etc., you have the same problem without the means to solve it. Because the measure is a one-off and not recurrent. That being said, we respect the responsibility of each particular body, and we respect the decisions taken by Eurostat. There are a number of one-off measures that are rejected by Eurostat. For instance receipts from privatisation are not considered recurrent and are not, as you know, computed in the Maastricht deficit calculation. Other one-off measures, for reasons that are under the responsibility of Eurostat and the Commission, are considered legitimate. We do not want to challenge what they consider acceptable one-off measures even if we know, and we always make the point very clearly, that the fact that they are not recurrent creates a problem of continuity for the future years. This means that if you solve a problem with a one-off measure for year X, in year X+1 you have to solve the problem with a real measure, because you have to solve it on a recurrent basis. But again, we do not challenge what is considered legitimate according to the rules of Eurostat and the Commission. As regards whether or not the ECB is a truly European institution, I have a very, very profound sentiment that the ECB is a truly European institution. It has to be. We have a single currency. We do not have a multiple series of currencies. We have a single monetary policy. We are European by definition. I mentioned the team spirit. We have a very strong team spirit. We have the capacity to decide in real time. When we had the dramatic events of 9/11 in the United States, we were able that very afternoon to decide that we would pour extremely high levels of liquidity into the market in Europe to avoid a crisis. And we also decided to embark on a swap of 50 billion dollars with the Federal Reserve System in order to be able to deliver dollars in Europe to cope with possible problems of counterparties in New York. That was done in real time, on the very afternoon of the Twin Towers’ collapse. We are a totally operational institution, able to decide immediately, to take single decisions with all colleagues. And each member of the staff of the ECB reasons on the basis of the European interest. By definition, again, we have only European interests to defend. Each national central bank governor, when he enters the room of the Governing Council, has to reason on a European basis. The legitimacy of a member of the Governing Council, whether he or she is a member of the Executive Board or a national central bank governor, stems from putting him or herself at the level of the superior interest of the euro area as a whole, of its 306 million inhabitants. Of course, we have to improve on a day-to-day basis. We have to work out our corporate culture and improve all that we have been doing. But I really think we are a truly European institution. "
2004-10-07,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Brussels. Today’s meeting is the tenth time that the Governing Council has met outside Frankfurt, and I would like to thank Governor Quaden for his invitation. Let me also express our gratitude to the staff of the Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique for their kind hospitality and perfect organisation of today’s meeting. Let me now report on the outcome of today’s meeting. As regards economic growth, while some uncertainty has recently arisen concerning the expected strengthening of activity, the economic recovery in the euro area is ongoing. Looking at price developments, high oil prices have had a visible direct impact on inflation rates this year. However, the risk of second-round effects still seems to be contained, and the overall outlook remains consistent with price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. This means that the level of interest rates continues to be very low by historical standards, in both nominal and real terms. Strong vigilance is warranted with regard to all developments which could imply risks to price stability over the medium term. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. The information available to date indicates that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. In particular, survey indicators up to September point to ongoing growth in industrial production and the services sector. Moreover, the gradual recovery in consumer confidence is proceeding, and there are some tentative signs of an improvement in the prospects for employment, although available indicators for household spending do not yet point to an immediate strengthening of consumption growth. All in all, the growth momentum seen in the euro area in the first half of 2004 should be broadly maintained in the coming quarters, in line with available forecasts from international organisations. On the external side, euro area exports should continue to benefit from favourable global demand conditions, not least from trade with the new EU Member States, where import demand has been strengthening. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the positive global environment and the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area. As companies restructure, improvements in corporate efficiency and higher profits are also supporting business investment. Moreover, there is scope for a recovery in euro area private consumption, in line with growth in real disposable income. Any central scenario for future developments is surrounded by a good deal of uncertainty, which at present is particularly related to oil prices. If oil prices were to remain high, or even increase further, it could dampen the strength of the recovery, both inside and outside the euro area, even though the oil intensity of production has fallen significantly since the 1970s and 1980s. All in all, while the burden resulting from higher oil prices cannot be avoided, its medium-term impact should be of a more limited magnitude than in the past. Obviously, for this outcome to materialise, all parties concerned must live up to their responsibilities. Turning to consumer prices, the oil market developments have had a direct impact on the euro area HICP. Following an annual rate of inflation of 1.7% in the first quarter of 2004, inflation reached 2.3% in the second quarter and remained at that level in July and August. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation seems to have fallen slightly in September, to 2.2%. Higher energy prices may have been more than compensated by lower food prices, partly due to base effects resulting from last year’s strong increases in this sub-category. Still, on the basis of current market expectations for oil prices, it appears unlikely that annual inflation rates will return to levels below 2% in the remainder of this year. Nevertheless, looking further ahead, the available information does not indicate that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up domestically. Recent wage developments have remained moderate, and this trend should continue. On the basis of this assumption, and provided that there are no further significant shocks to prices, annual inflation rates should drop below 2% in 2005. Several upward risks to the outlook for price stability continue to exist. Concerns again relate to oil price developments, in particular to the extent that second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting behaviour materialise. It is therefore of the utmost importance to avoid inappropriate reactions, as observed in past episodes of strong oil price increases. A further upward risk relates to the future development of indirect taxes and administered prices. These upside risks call for ongoing vigilance, which is a necessary condition for keeping medium to long-term inflation expectations in line with our definition of price stability. As regards the monetary analysis, M3 growth remains resilient. The downward trend in annual M3 growth from mid-2003 appears to have halted over the summer months, and the shorter-term dynamics of M3 have strengthened. This reflects the fact that the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area continues to support monetary expansion, especially of the most liquid assets included in the narrow aggregate M1. The low level of interest rates also fuels the growth of MFI credit. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remains robust, largely driven by the dynamism of mortgage loans. These are also supported by strong house price increases in several euro area countries. There remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. At present, it is not clear how this excess liquidity, which is mainly the result of past portfolio shifts, will be used in the future. If significant parts of these liquid holdings were to be transformed into transaction balances, particularly at a time when confidence and economic activity were strengthening, inflationary risks would rise. In addition, high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could become a source of substantial asset price increases. To sum up, annual inflation rates should fall below 2% in 2005, but a number of medium-term upside risks to price stability need to be carefully monitored. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis also supports the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability. Let me also address the current evidence on fiscal developments, where the latest budgetary notifications are a source of concern. While some countries will maintain a sound budgetary position, a significant number of euro area countries are expected to record deficits near to or above 3%. The aggregate euro area fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase somewhat, as is the debt-to-GDP ratio. In the coming years, important challenges for the consolidation of public finances will have to be faced. Member States need to renew their consolidation efforts and should not rely on one-off measures, so as to comply with their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact and to foster confidence. They must also set the right priorities in public finances, towards structural reform, innovation and competitiveness. This would very much support the Lisbon agenda and thereby promote economic growth, foster job creation and reduce unemployment. Concerning the European fiscal framework, the Governing Council is convinced that substantial improvements in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact are possible and would be beneficial, while we would warn against a change to the text of the Treaty or the Regulations which form the basis of the Pact. We consider the Pact as key to ensuring macroeconomic stability on a sustainable basis. It is a framework which is necessary to preserve sound fiscal policies in the euro area, for which strict surveillance and effective peer pressure on national budget policies are indispensable. It is of vital importance to the credibility of the budgetary surveillance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics is ensured. The European accounting rules must be fully respected when recording all types of expenditure and revenue. This should be done in a manner that is consistent and stable over time and homogeneous across countries. The procedures must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles, as stated by the ECOFIN Council. Countries should consider the quality and integrity of their statistics as a priority matter. Finally, let me report on the detailed discussion we had today on employment and unemployment developments in the euro area. Two observations stand out when we look at the period of relatively slow real GDP expansion since early 2001. First, after an initial rise, the euro area unemployment rate has remained broadly unchanged since early 2003. And second, there seems to have been a relatively limited negative impact on employment growth over the past few years. The following factors might help to explain this pattern. While the period of slow growth has been relatively long from a historical perspective, the cyclical amplitudes have been smaller and have not therefore triggered very sharp reactions of employment and unemployment. In addition, wage developments have been more favourable than in previous episodes, and firms may have – to a greater extent than previously – adjusted labour input downwards in term of hours, rather than in terms of employees. This in turn might indicate that firms have gained an element of flexibility to adjust costs. Looking forward, from a cyclical point of view, employment should recover and unemployment could start falling in the course of next year if overall demand develops as expected. This should support economic growth through an increase in labour income and a positive impact on consumer confidence, and thus on consumption. However, structural problems remain large. This is highlighted, for example, by the fact that over 40% of all unemployed people in the euro area have been without a job for more than a year. In order to decisively overcome the obstacles towards more employment growth and to reduce the trend or structural level of unemployment, further comprehensive labour market reforms are of the essence. We are now at your disposal for questions. On the first question, I would say that we are, of course, observing the increase in prices. We cannot react on a day-to-day basis, and we have exactly the same posture of vigilance that we had before. I would add that, when I was in Washington on the occasion of the recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, I participated on behalf of the ECB in the deliberations and discussions of the G7, and you may have seen that in the G7 Communiqué we called upon oil producers to be as responsible as possible. We also called upon the consumer countries to embark on energy conservation. But, again, on the first question, our vigilance – as I have stressed earlier – remains strong. Again, we are calling for responsibility by all parties, for them to fulfil their responsibilities. As regards the Stability and Growth Pact, I have already been very clear on what our position was. I do not want to elaborate too much on that again, because we still have the same position and because I have reiterated on behalf of the Governing Council that very same position, namely that we are on board for improvement and implementation as regards, in particular, the preventive arm of the Pact, depending, of course, on careful examination of the very precise orientations that would be retained by the Council of Ministers of Finance, which is the responsible body. And, as regards the corrective arm of the Pact, we have said clearly both that we would call for the Treaty and the Regulations not to be changed and that we believe it to be extremely important to retain the nominal anchor of 3%. On the first point, as you know, we are as comprehensive as possible in our economic analysis. So we take all parameters into account, including, of course, what could come from commodities in general. It is also true that the oil price increases are so important and visible that they perhaps have a tendency to hide other commodity increases a little, elements that are there and that we have to take into account. But, that having been said, I would not confirm that our sentiments in that respect have changed since the last meeting of the Governing Council. As regards house price increases, I have already mentioned the fact that we look carefully at the counterparts of M3, in particular at household credit. And, in general, within the scope of household credit, the development of which is quite rapid, there is an element to be underlined, which is that housing credit, housing loans, are very dynamic, and that is obviously something that we have to look at. The first point: I would say that there was a very wide and general feeling amongst the Governing Council that to maintain rates at the present level was in line with our analysis. On the second point: I said what we had to say as regards the position of the Governing Council and I do not want to read again the paragraph which deals with the reliability of the figures. As you know, I read it and it will be available of course as part of our overall introductory remarks, but I could nevertheless read it again: “It is of vital importance to the credibility of the budgetary surveillance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics is ensured. The European accounting rules must be fully respected when recording all types of expenditure and revenue. This should be done in a manner that is consistent and stable over time and homogeneous across countries. The procedures must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles, as stated by the ECOFIN Council. Countries should consider the quality and integrity of their statistics as a priority matter”. On the very precise questions you had on Greece and the checking of figures at the moment of that country’s entry into the euro area I would say the following: if I refer to the present Greek Government and the Minister of Finance, who has questioned a number of figures, he had mentioned that this did not put in question the entry of Greece into the euro area, so I refer to that particular point. The information that we have today when I look at everything would confirm that sentiment, but I remain of course cautious because we are expecting the full report of Eurostat to definitely clarify the situation. Papademos: Let me further clarify the revisions of the budget deficit in previous years, for the period 2000 to 2002, which have been recently reported. As some of you know, these are explained by two factors: the first is more information about the surpluses of social security funds and the second factor is a change in the methodology for the recording of government expenditures on military equipment. According to the new methodology, these expenditures are being recorded on the basis of cash payments, while in the past they were estimated on the basis of deliveries. Now, as I have also mentioned on another occasion, the Bank of Greece in the past systematically every year provided estimates of the budget deficit employing different methodologies – on a national accounting basis, on an accrual basis and on a cash basis. And these figures are available but it was understood and it had been accepted that the appropriate concept for judging the convergence criteria or for the excessive deficit procedure is the one calculated on a national accounting basis, which in turn records military spending on the basis of deliveries. The change has taken place because, as it has been stated, there were questions concerning the reliability of the application of the appropriate methodology. The Bank of Greece provided all the figures which could be estimated on the basis of the information available. Now on the specific issue about the magnitude of the budget deficit before the year 2000 – the Bank of Greece has no information about deliveries. I also refer to the statement of the Minister of Finance, who knows the available data and who recently stated that there is no doubt that the country fulfilled at the time the criteria. But, as the President said, there will be a further analysis of this by Eurostat and we will see the outcome of this study. I should add that the criteria at that time [1999] were fully met not only on the national accounting basis but also on an accrual basis. Another interesting remark is that all these changes regarding the magnitude of the budget deficit as estimated by different approaches have no implications for the level of the debt because the debt has always taken into account credits and cash payments for the purchase of the relevant military equipment. On the first question, namely employment, we have observed, as you have observed, that there has been a very steady level of employment and unemployment figures by way of consequence over the cycle, which we explained in the introductory remarks. But it is also true that we have recently seen signs in the right direction. We have noted that. We expect this phenomenon to be confirmed in the quarters to come. But we remain cautious. What is clear is that we have the feeling that the adjustment in the difficult period of time was made very much by reducing working hours in a number of firms in the productive sector without diminishing overall employment. We are expecting that, in the better times in which we are living right now, the reverse will be done, namely increasing the number of hours worked per worker, and thereby less buoyant recruiting because there have not been buoyant lay-offs. So that is a consideration we have to take into account. We are also of the sentiment that further comprehensive labour market reforms could help considerably to improve job creation. This is not new; this is an analysis that we have been doing for a long period of time. I take it that it is also a joint analysis with the Commission and with the Council. It is part of the Lisbon agenda and the Lisbon diagnostic. However, we know that it is easy to talk about these labour market reforms and more difficult to embark on them. And that is why we are backing governments and parliaments that are embarking on those reforms. On the second question I would only say that there was a consensus in the last G7 meeting on the occasion of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, that, if we take only those two very big economies –US and Europe – we both have assets and liabilities. The assets of Europe are that we are balanced and we are financing our investments with our own savings. We have also a number of other assets. But we have a liability which is important: our economy should be more flexible, and calls for structural reforms, which are of the essence in Europe. In the United States it is clearly the reverse. They have assets like suppleness and flexibility of the economy, which is undoubtedly a big asset. They also have other assets. And they have an important liability, which is their lack of savings. This lack of savings materialises in their current account deficit. So, we both have to work hard to redress our weak points. What we have seen when looking at the different modelling of the global economy and of our own economy is that, undoubtedly, there is a very large dispersion of results on growth in particular when you put the same input as regards the price of oil. And that, of course, is a confirmation of what you know is our sentiment – namely that you cannot rely upon one single model or one single system of equation, but that the representation of reality is much more complex. We look always for robustness. So, I will certainly not give you one figure. I would say that we have quite a number of different figures. What is absolutely clear is that if oil remains at the present level, we will have an impact on global growth which will certainly not be negligible and we will have a direct impact on inflation which will also not be negligible. And I said that very clearly in the introductory remarks. But what is extremely important for the central banks all over the world and for us, the ECB, in particular, is that we must prevent what we call the “second round effects” of this oil shock or of any inflationary shocks. We have the feeling that our vigilant stance is extremely important because all economic agents have to know that we are vigilant to prevent those second round effects from materialising. We are very keen to maintain inflationary expectations in the medium run at the present level, namely in line with our definition of price stability. This is our duty. This is, of course, very important because price stability is our mandate. It is also important for the sake of growth and job creation in Europe because, as you know, those low, medium, and long-term inflationary expectations are enshrined in the medium and long-term market rates that we are enjoying today in the euro area and that are conducive, we trust, to growth. It is uncertainty in the eyes of the full body of the Governing Council, the reflection of our understanding of the situation. And, of course, it is directly linked to what we have observed, particularly as regards the price of oil. That is something which we must bear fully in mind. The difficulty of foreseeing the future in this regard is clear. As you know, most of the institutions and forecasters rely very much on the futures market for assessing the future price of oil. It appears that this has led to some underestimations compared to what we were really observing. So, uncertainty is certainly a major issue for central bankers. And that uncertainty has certainly increased somewhat in line with what we have observed in this domain. So, it is the judgement of the Governing Council. As regards the first question, I would reiterate that the compilation of reporting of reliable government statistics is, for us, of vital importance to the credibility of the budgetary surveillance exercise. The European accounting rules must be fully respected when recording all kinds of expenditure and revenue, and this should be done in a manner which is consistent and stable over time and homogeneous throughout Member States. That, for us, is very important and we would certainly consider that countries must make the quality and integrity of their statistics a priority. Countries should respect high standards which would reinforce the independence, integrity and accountability of national statistical institutions and one would, therefore, have full confidence in the quality of government financial statistics. I would certainly insist on these standards being reviewed regularly. We have an absolute need for a system which would be fully reliable, both at the level of the national institutions that have to provide the statistics and at the level of the full body of the European Union. So, again, I would not express anything on any particular country but I would say– as it was mentioned by ECOFIN – that we must have stable figures which are not dependent on electoral or political cycles. I am quoting what has already been said by the governments concerned when they discussed this at the informal ECOFIN meeting in The Hague. Again, we must rely on a fully reliable system and I take it that it is the view of the Commission and the view of the Council; it is also what should be done from now on at the level of Eurostat and we are confident that this necessary improvement will be put into action. Papademos: Over the last few months the three prize-winning architects from the architectural design competition that was completed in the spring have been preparing revised plans which aim to meet fully the requirements of the ECB and to address certain recommendations of the jury of the architectural design competition. No decision has been taken either by the Governing Council or the Executive Board concerning these revised plans, which have not yet been submitted to the decision-making bodies. The Governing Council is expected to discuss and evaluate the revised designs of the three prize-winning competitors in the middle of November. So these are the facts, and any speculation concerning possible choices is unfounded because decisions have not yet been taken and the revised plans have not yet been assessed. On the second question first: there has not, to my knowledge, been a decision, but indeed a Recommendation of the Commission to the Council. And I have no particular comment on that. It is the responsibility of the Commission and the Council. On the first point, I feel that we have been very precise both on what the position of the Governing Council was and on the fact that we have an absolute need for reliable, coherent, stable and timely sets of statistics as regards public finance. I have also mentioned what was said on the occasion of the informal ECOFIN meeting by the governments concerned. I have already said that several times, so I take it that there is no point in mentioning anything else. Of course, it applies to the newcomers as well as to the present members, that goes without saying. As regards the risks to growth – upward or downward – I would not say that we have changed our judgement substantially or significantly. To sum up our view in the best fashion possible, it is clear that we still have upward risks, that is absolutely clear. In French I would say “chance”, the chance of there being upward risks to growth, but we will have to see whether they materialise. We also have downward risks, to the extent that the new environment that we have had since the two meetings is clearly influenced by the fact that we have had a bad evolution as regards the price of oil. It is clear that there is a nuance there and that, if we had the price of oil remaining at this level, it would confirm that we have a downward risk that would be perhaps more tangible. That having been said, we are also making the working assumption that the present price figures will not necessarily last for long. I refer also to the G7 Communiqué from Washington which is calling for all partners to be as responsible as possible. So, we have to be realistic and, I would say, totally lucid, practical and pragmatic as regards our own actions and be vigilant – that is absolutely decisive. On the other hand, we call upon all partners to be responsible. As regards liquidity, if I have understood your question correctly, I can find nothing to add to what I have already said. You know that it is from our constant analysis that we know that a part of this extra liquidity we are observing came from portfolio shifts, and we are looking at what is happening now in this same portfolio with great attention. You know to which extent we are attached to our two-pillar approach. It is an analysis that is very important for us. Seen from the perspective of the medium and long-term inflationary expectations, we trust that, in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon and we trust that our two-pillar approach is precisely what permits us perhaps to be more assured that our medium and long-term inflationary expectations are fully in line with our definition of price stability. Regarding your third point if my memory is correct, you are referring to the speech I delivered in Philadelphia where I was referring clearly to what we had observed in the past, in the “long-ago” past, in Europe in comparison with the United States. I referred to the relative stability of the figures that we had observed in the past, while they were far more volatile in the United States. It has nothing to do with the coming publication. And it does not signal anything at all. I would certainly not say that we think that something like what has been observed in other economies is likely at the level of the euro area as whole. Nevertheless, in some economies in the euro area, this phenomenon is undoubtedly very dynamic. But, for the euro area as a whole, there is a need for a thorough examination – this is what we do at each meeting – and for vigilance. To sum up the situation as cautiously as possible, I would say that there is no need for alarm at this stage. But again we have to remain very vigilant, because this is a strongly dynamic phenomenon. Again, I do not want to elaborate further on the Stability and Growth Pact; I have said very clearly what our current attitude is. We consider that these criteria are of great importance and must certainly be looked at carefully. We would not subscribe to the idea that if you have less debt you should be encouraged to have more deficit. It is not something which, in our opinion, fits with the idea of encouraging the best behaviour possible. But I do not want to elaborate on the economic reasoning behind this, namely that if you have less debt then you are at an advantage because you have less service of the debt and more room for manoeuvre than other countries; and why encourage a country to go on piling up debt until it reaches 60% when that particular country could be much better off with less debt? "
2004-09-02,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council, Mr Zalm, and Commissioner Almunia. We noted that the information which has become available in recent months indicates that the economic recovery in the euro area has maintained its momentum and should remain firm in the coming quarters. We have also witnessed somewhat higher inflation rates, mainly due to developments in oil prices. At present, our judgement is that although some upside risks to price stability exist, the overall prospects remain in line with price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have retained our monetary policy stance and left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The level of interest rates is very low by historical standards, both in nominal and in real terms, lending support to economic activity. We will remain vigilant with regard to all developments which could imply risks to price stability over the medium term. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. The latest data releases confirm that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, real GDP grew by 0.5% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of this year, having recorded a 0.6% increase in the first quarter. These growth rates are the strongest in the euro area for some time. The latest indicators of output and demand remain consistent with ongoing growth in real activity, increasingly supported by domestic demand, also in the third quarter of 2004. Looking ahead, the conditions for a continuation of the recovery remain in place. Economic growth outside the euro area continues to be robust overall, even if subject to temporary fluctuations, and should continue to support euro area export growth. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the positive global environment and the very favourable financing conditions. Improvements in corporate efficiency and higher profits are also supporting business investment. Moreover, private consumption should continue its gradual recovery, broadly in line with growth in real disposable income which, with the usual lag, should be further underpinned by an increase in employment growth later on. Against this background, we expect the economic recovery in the euro area to continue and to become more broadly based over the coming quarters, leading to a somewhat stronger upswing in the course of 2005. This is also reflected in the ECB staff projections, which will be published today. They envisage euro area real GDP growth of between 1.6% and 2.2% on average in 2004, rising to between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2005. These growth rates are close to estimates for long-run potential growth and, for both years, they are slightly higher than was expected in the June Eurosystem staff projections. Available forecasts from international organisations and other sources convey a broadly similar picture. Overall, the risks to these projections seem to be broadly balanced. On the upside, the ongoing momentum of the recovery may again imply more positive developments for economic growth in the coming quarters. On the downside, there are still concerns about continuing economic imbalances in other parts of the world. These imbalances could affect the sustainability of the economic recovery. Another downside risk to the growth projections relates to oil prices. If these were to remain higher than currently expected by markets, this could dampen both foreign and domestic demand. In assessing these risks, however, it should be taken into account that, when expressed in euro, the recent rise in oil prices has been significantly smaller than in previous episodes when oil price increases had a major impact on the world economy. In addition, in real terms, oil prices are significantly below the peaks they have reached in the past. Moreover, when compared with the 1970s and 1980s, the oil intensity of production in the euro area and elsewhere has fallen significantly. Finally, it should be kept in mind that, in contrast to previous periods of oil price turmoil, this year’s rise in oil prices is not only due to supply-side factors, but is also driven by the strong global expansion. All these factors put the downside risks to economic activity coming from oil prices into perspective. However, recent oil price developments have had a visible direct impact on price developments in the euro area. Eurostat’s flash estimate for annual HICP inflation in August was 2.3%, unchanged from July On the basis of current market expectations for oil prices, it appears unlikely that annual inflation rates will return to levels below 2% in the remainder of this year. Looking ahead, however, there are no indications at present of stronger underlying inflationary pressures building up domestically. Recent wage developments have been moderate, and this trend is expected to continue for some time to come in view of the continued high level of unemployment in the euro area. If this is the case, and provided that one-off shocks to prices from other sources such as those seen in 2004 are not repeated, annual inflation rates should drop below 2% in 2005. Against this background the ECB staff projections put average annual HICP inflation at between 2.1% and 2.3% for 2004 and between 1.3% and 2.3% for 2005. The lower end of these ranges is slightly higher than what was projected in June for both 2004 and 2005. The ECB staff projections for inflation are broadly consistent with other recently released forecasts. However, several upward risks to the projections for inflation exist. Concerns relate in particular to oil price developments, which may continue to have a visible impact on inflation. Oil price rises also imply the risk of second-round effects emerging in wage and price-setting, a risk which intensifies when the economic upswing strengthens. A further upward risk relates to the future evolution of indirect taxes and administered prices. Indeed, upside risks to inflation are also reflected in the continued elevated levels of measures of long-term inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators. While these indicators should always be interpreted with caution, their current level calls for particular vigilance. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual rate of M3 growth has moderated significantly since the summer of 2003. This moderation largely represents a normalisation of portfolio allocation behaviour following the easing of the exceptional economic and financial uncertainty which prevailed between 2001 and early 2003. Nonetheless, M3 growth remains resilient. It appears that the reversal of past portfolio shifts is proceeding more slowly than would have been expected on the basis of historical regularities. This may reflect an increased risk aversion of households and firms, given the stock market losses they experienced between 2000 and the spring of 2003. In addition, the low level of interest rates continues to support monetary expansion, especially of the most liquid assets included in the narrow aggregate M1. The low level of interest rates also seems to be fuelling the growth of loans to the private sector, which has risen to a relatively robust rate over recent months. In this respect, the growth rate of mortgage loans to households is rather high and is associated with fairly dynamic housing market developments and real estate prices in several euro area countries. There remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. At present, it is not clear how this excess liquidity will be used in the future. If significant parts of these liquid holdings were to be transformed into transaction balances, particularly at a time when confidence and economic activity were strengthening, inflationary risks would rise. In addition, high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could become a source for strong asset price increases. To sum up, while the economic analysis indicates that prospects are consistent with price stability being maintained over the medium term, a number of upside risks need to be carefully monitored. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis also supports the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability. As regards fiscal policy, first data for 2004 indicate that most euro area countries are likely to miss the original budgetary targets set in their updated stability programmes. In some cases, countries seem to have based their programmes on overly optimistic assumptions for economic developments. In addition, some countries have been implementing fewer consolidation measures than originally planned. As a consequence, the aggregate fiscal balance for the euro area is not likely to improve in 2004. Progress in fiscal consolidation needs to be prioritised and should be part of a comprehensive and growth-friendly reform agenda. The Governing Council remains convinced that there was and there is no need for changes to the text of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Pact is an appropriate framework for dealing with countries’ fiscal developments on a level playing-field. At the same time, we consider that improvements could be introduced in the implementation of the Pact. In line with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, macroeconomic policies need to be oriented towards growth and stability in the euro area. This also requires sustained efforts to increase the flexibility of labour and product markets in the euro area. In this respect, several governments in the euro area have taken courageous steps over recent months. It is important that the reform momentum is maintained, taking advantage of the economic recovery. This will not only increase overall economic efficiency and enhance longer-term growth prospects in the euro area, but will also strengthen the basis for a sustained economic upswing in the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions. Well, first of all, Commissioner Almunia gave us a number of indications of what is likely to be discussed tomorrow. If I understand well, it is tomorrow that the Commission will discuss and approve some guidelines and suggestions and proposals. As I said, our present position, which is only a preliminary, provisional position, because we are waiting for the official proposal of the Commission – and for that of the Council, which will decide as a last resort – is that our preliminary, provisional observations are fully in line with what we have said before. We take it that improvements in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact could be made. And on a number of points we feel that some improvements could really be effective: in particular, as regards the “preventive arm” of the Pact, where we think that we could strengthen the incentives for compliance “in good times”. One of the most frequent observations which is made about the Stability and Growth Pact is that we have problems in difficult times because the system is not, in its implementation of the preventive arm framework, sufficiently cautious when things are going well. We also think that the timetable for the monitoring process, again in the “preventive arm”, could be improved so that stability and convergence programmes and their assessment would better guide domestic budgetary processes. And we also think, again, provisionally, that taking into account the cycle and the structural aspects of the situation could be, in the preventive arm, an important improvement as regards the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Having said all that, as regards the “corrective arm”, we would insist that we do not see – and we trust that this is also a view shared by others – a need to change the wording of the Pact, the text of the regulation. In particular, the 3% threshold, which is in the Treaty itself – and nobody has asked for a change to the Treaty – is to be observed in nominal terms and certainly not in structurally adjusted terms. That is, of course, important, and it is the position of the Governing Council at this stage. It is fully in line with what I have already said here. We are now awaiting the decision of the Commission. But for the moment our preliminary position is what I have said it is. Well, first of all I would make two remarks. One is that, as you know, there is a distinction between the Governing Council – which takes the decision as regards monetary policy – and the staff, whether it is the staff of the Eurosystem, as was the case last time, or the staff of the ECB, which is the case this time. So, it is really a projection made by the staff. And we look not only at that, but at all other information, in particular the information that you have been mentioning. Second remark: the changes are not very significant. It is clear, as I said, that the present summer projections are a little more favourable than was the case three months ago with the spring projections. That said, it is a slight change and that would certainly not lead me to say that we have dramatic and significant changes in these projections. It is only a little more favourable. It is so, after taking into account a great amount of input, including the fact that for this year, as you might remember, the first quarter was better than expected and the second quarter was, in some cases, also a little better. And so, fortunately, in the first six months of this year we had facts and figures that were better than previously expected. Incidentally, it gives the Governing Council of the ECB the impression that it was right to mention on the occasion of successive press conference that we trusted that we were observing a gradual recovery. But you might remember that this was more or less questioned by a number of observers, which would have recommended doing this and that on the basis of a judgement which was less optimistic. The fact is that we said at the time that our judgement was that we were witnessing a gradual recovery and all facts and figures thus far, including those I have just mentioned, have confirmed this. But again, to sum up, it is not a significant change. I would say that it roughly confirms what our previous judgement was and what our present judgement is on this gradual recovery which is gradually materialising. Again, I must be clear on the fact that what I am mentioning are only provisional and preliminary observations. They are in line with what we had already said before the Commission envisaged making formal and official proposals and so I will not comment further on the Commission proposal while we do not have the official proposal of the Commission. So, the Governing Council will say what it has to say on the basis of the official position. I don’t want to predict what is likely or not likely to be decided tomorrow by the European Commission. This is a good question, and an important question. In all very large economies that I know – and after all I know at least this one, the euro area , and another one which is approximately the same size – in these kinds of continental, very large economies you have, and you might have, and we are observing, from time to time, substantial differences from country to country, from state to state, from, economy to economy, You might very well have a boom in one place while you have difficult periods in another, and I don’t want to cite any particular economy in Europe, but we all have in mind such examples. And it is true for growth, for the buoyancy of one economy whilst on the other hand, for the difficulties that one other economy has to cope with. It is also true for inflation, and academic research has suggested that, when you look at the overall level of inflation in our own economy and in the other big economy that I have mentioned, we see that the orders of magnitude of the overall dispersion of inflation from state to state could be considered very similar. There is no significant differential. So what we are observing, namely that there are indeed differences in economic behaviour and in inflation from country to country in our own continental economy in the euro area, is probably something natural in such a wide continental economy. And, as you know, the Governing Council of the ECB looks at the economy as a whole, the sum of all those individual economies, just as our friends at the Federal Reserve add together California and Massachusetts, even if they are not necessarily behaving in exactly the same way. And I would add that it is a requirement of the Treaty and that each of us – not only, of course, the members of the Executive Board, but also the governors of the national central banks – has to look at the situation from the point of view of the euro area as a whole and not from a particular national perspective. That being said, of course, I think it is important to understand why we are observing those differences and, of course, to do all that can be done – both by the various interested parties and particularly, of course, the governments themselves and the parliaments and social partners – to understand why we are observing certain things and why, perhaps, on a country-to-country basis, improvements would be appropriate. But again, let's not forget that this is something which is normal in a big continent-wide economy with a single currency. I will repeat, and give you a sense of our understanding of the situation. We are confident, as I said, that we will go back to our definition of price stability next year on the basis of our present assumptions, i.e. that wages and salaries are moderate, that there are no second-round effects from the increases in the price of oil, that there are no nasty surprises regarding the price of oil in comparison with our assumptions, which are based, as you know, on futures markets, and that there are no bad surprises regarding indirect taxes and administrative taxes, which have been responsible, this year and in previous years, for some increases. Our diagnosis is that strong vigilance is of the essence in the present situation. Upside risks are present and visible. So we are confident, on the basis of our present assumptions, and vigilant, because it is something which is not only our duty but which stems from the present situation. And I would like to remind you of something which is extremely important in our eyes, which is that the present European economic recovery relies very much on a favourable financial environment. This favourable environment is characterised in particular by the level of medium and long-term market rates, which we do not command ourselves but which are determined by the market. And why do we have a very favourable financial environment? Because inflationary expectations, which are enshrined in these medium and long-term market rates, are in line with our definition of price stability. We look at that very carefully, and our surveys are fully in line with our definition of price stability. We are also observing what happens in the financial markets in this respect. Overall the present level of medium and long-term market interest rates is favourable again at the level of the euro area as a whole, owing to the fact that these inflationary expectations are favourable, in line with our definition. The reason for these favourable expectations is our own credibility. And this level of credibility is entirely dependent, in the eyes of all observers and, I trust, of yourselves and the market participants, on our vigilance. It is because there is a belief that we are vigilant and that we are credible that market expectations are as favourable as they are. This to explain why we believe that this strong vigilance is appropriate in the present circumstances and is helping to preserve this favourable environment and therefore growth. On the first point I am not sure that I was that happy. No. I mentioned that we had to look at it very carefully. I said that we undoubtedly had excess liquidity– I do not want to paraphrase, or to read what I said again, but we really have to look carefully at M3 growth which remains resilient, as you have mentioned. It appears that the reversal of past portfolio shifts is proceeding more slowly – and I trust that this is exactly your point – than would have been expected on the basis of historical evidence. So, that is our analysis. We have to look at it carefully. We should not treat with benign neglect what we are observing in this respect. And I mention that explicitly. As regards the ESCB position and the CESR clearing and settlement issue I would not like to say anything on the timetable. We are thinking about it and I will let you know once we have reached a conclusion. Well, on the first point, we did not discuss an interest rate cut. On the second point, if I have understood the question correctly, we have had a recovery that was triggered by exports, by net exports. It is our judgement that the recovery will progressively become more broadly based, namely that domestic consumption, on the one hand, and investment, on the other, will materialise and help – I would say – allow a broader base for the recovery. There are major differences from one economy to another. That could bring us back to an earlier question. But of course, I am speaking of the euro area as a whole. We have already observed – as the figures which have been published show – that there was a progressively more broadly based recovery, as is normal and as is to be expected. At the time when we had had the feeling that consumption, household consumption in particular, was very weak, abnormally weak, and that part of this weakness was due to, perhaps, the sentiment that inflation would hamper purchasing power in the household constituency in future, we had said to households that they could be confident, that we were there, that we were the guardian of the currency and that we would take care of this threat that some households perhaps felt looming. And I think that this helped. I do not want to overemphasise the messages we may send, but I feel that they were part of the overall confidence rebuilding. The fact that we are the guardian of the currency, and – in some respects – the guardian of the confidence, a kind of sanctuary for confidence, is, in our opinion, helping the various economic agents and constituencies in particular in the present conjuncture. It is also clear that an acceleration of investment should also be part of the broadly based recovery. And I would like to mention here that the favourable financial environment we currently enjoy is certainly regarded and understood by economic agents and investors as part of the recovery process. I said that we did not discuss a cut, I said that we considered that what we had observed was in line with our definition of price stability. We maintain our rates as they are and we are pretty vigilant, because there are upside risks to price stability. I have no response other than what has been indicated by the various projections that we have available – not only the staff projections, which are published immediately after our meeting today, but I have mentioned the figures, and you can draw your own conclusions from those. The real GDP in 2004 in this forecast will be between 1.6% and 2.2%, and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2005. So I would not say that this signals that the peak is in 2004 because the ranges are superior in 2005 to what we have observed in 2004. So, what we publish does not confirm your assumptions. Well, again, we will see. It is a very peculiar situation because the Commission will examine these proposals tomorrow and I do not want to prejudge anything. I would say that if the Commission decides to propose a number of improvements to the implementation, then that would be in line with what we have already said and we would, of course, welcome them, provided we look at them very carefully. Again, as I said, these are preliminary observations and we have to be very precise, very professional in such matters, which are highly technical. If there is a proposal to change the rules and to change the text, i.e. the wording of the Pact, then it is clear that this would not be at all in line with our own recommendation. That is a very important question. Again, we undoubtedly have to take into account these events, which nobody was able to foresee, if you look at previous assumptions. And we also have to recognise that it is very difficult to foresee such an evolution. Futures markets, for instance, have thus far been wrong in pre-assessing or guiding the projection for future price levels. That said, I do not know of any much better methodology than to look at the futures market in this respect. That notwithstanding, we also have to take into account, as I said earlier, that energy intensity has improved in all economies, also in our own economy. And in our own economy, if I compare the current situation with the situation in 1973-74, the first oil price shock, I would say that the energy intensity of GDP output has been halved. If I pick out oil consumption from among the types of energy consumption, it too has diminished quite substantially. The figures I have – again, this needs to be checked very carefully – but the figures I have would seem to indicate a reduction from 59% in 1971 to 42% in 2000. So we have a combination of a reduction of energy consumption per unit of GDP output and a diminishing share of oil consumption in total energy consumption. These are phenomena that we have to bear in mind when assessing the current situation. We, of course, also have the past appreciation of the euro, which – as I have also mentioned – has probably contributed to the fact that the impact may have been smaller than it would otherwise have been. All that having been said, it needs to be mentioned that this explains partially why, despite the importance of the oil price increases, we are observing projections that do not indicate a dramatic impact. What I have said on this impact seems to be true for the euro area economy. I do not want to qualify the situation in other parts of the world, but it also seems to be reasonably true for other major economies in the world, notably for the sister economy I have mentioned. But, we again have to be very cautious. I was cautious, I am cautious because we have risks that have to be considered, both for growth and for inflation. We have to remain vigilant, and I have explained why strong vigilance was of the essence today. That having been said, we are confident on the basis of our current analysis and trust that, thanks to our vigilance, price developments will be in line with our definition of price stability. Thank you very much. "
2004-07-01,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. On the basis of the regular economic and monetary analyses, we have confirmed our assessment of last month. While somewhat stronger inflationary pressure is likely to persist over the short term, the outlook still remains in line with price stability over the medium term. Therefore, the Governing Council decided to retain its monetary policy stance, leaving the key ECB interest rates unchanged. By historical standards, interest rates are low, both in nominal and in real terms, also lending support to economic activity. The Governing Council will remain vigilant with regard to all developments which could affect the risks to price stability over the medium term. Let me now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. Following quarterly real GDP growth of 0.6% in the first quarter of this year, the latest data releases confirm that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. All in all, the latest indicators of output and expenditure, as well as the most recent survey data, remain consistent with ongoing growth in real activity during the second quarter. Looking ahead, we remain confident that the recovery of economic activity will continue. The conditions for a broadening and strengthening of the recovery are in place. On the external side, economic growth outside the euro area remains strong, which should promote euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the positive external environment and the favourable financing conditions within the euro area. As corporate restructuring gathers pace and business efficiency advances, the resulting improvements in profits should further underpin business investment. Moreover, the recovery of private consumption should proceed in line with increases in real disposable income and the anticipated subsequent strengthening of employment growth. Available forecasts from international and private organisations paint a broadly similar picture of the outlook for the euro area. The expectation of a continued economic recovery is also in line with recent developments in financial markets. Of course, this scenario of an ongoing economic recovery may be influenced by a number of factors working in opposite directions. On the upside, euro area growth in the first quarter was stronger than anticipated and this momentum may strengthen shorter-term dynamics. Ongoing robust growth in the global economy could also lead to stronger than expected activity in the euro area. On the downside, despite having declined somewhat, oil prices remain at high levels and may, largely through their impact on the euro area’s terms of trade, dampen growth. Furthermore, over longer horizons, there are concerns relating to the persistence of global imbalances. Turning to price developments, there is a need to distinguish between short-term developments and the medium-term trend when assessing risks to price stability. Over the short term, oil prices continue to exert upward pressure on the general price level. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in June, having stood at 2.5% in May. Although oil prices have fallen over the last weeks, markets expect them to remain high for some time. Were this to occur, inflation rates would most likely remain above 2% for longer than previously expected. Looking beyond the short term, however, the outlook remains consistent with price stability, provided that wages develop moderately, in line with the latest evidence available. Nevertheless, there are some upside risks to price stability. The strength of global economic dynamism may continue to exert upward pressure on commodity prices, including oil prices. Moreover, following rather strong increases in the past, the further evolution of indirect taxes and administered prices is difficult to incorporate into any forward-looking assessment at this point in time, because such information usually becomes available only later in the year. Against this background, the potential risk of second-round effects via wage and pricing behaviour needs to be monitored closely. Social partners can make an important contribution to facilitating the maintenance of price stability by focusing on the medium-term outlook for price developments rather than on currently observed rates of inflation. This would also be conducive to fostering employment growth. Finally, measures of long-term inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators remain relatively high. While these indicators should be interpreted with caution, their development calls for particular vigilance. Moving to the monetary analysis, the overall picture remains unchanged from our previous assessment. Annual M3 growth rates have fallen over recent months. While this decline partly reflects base effects, the portfolio decisions of firms and households are also returning to normal as financial uncertainties have receded. Indeed, there are signs that savings are increasingly being allocated to long-term assets outside M3 rather than to liquid monetary assets. However, despite the recent moderation of annual M3 growth, there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. While a significant part of the excess liquidity has accumulated as a result of past portfolio shifts, low interest rates have also fuelled the build-up of liquid assets. The low level of interest rates also supports credit growth. The stock of excess liquidity, if it persists, may pose an upside risk to price stability over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the medium-term outlook for price developments remains in line with price stability, while ongoing close monitoring is necessary. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports this conclusion, including the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of upside risks to price stability. The Governing Council also discussed a number of issues relating to economic policies in the euro area. First, as regards fiscal policies, it is now of the highest priority that all countries concerned re-establish their commitment to consolidation in order to avoid past mistakes of unbalanced policies in a recovery period. Indeed, the recovery offers the opportunity to put public finances on a sounder track. This requires a strict control of expenditure in the implementation of this year’s budget and a comprehensive reform strategy as a basis for next year’s fiscal planning. Credible expenditure-based reforms are needed to sustain budgetary consolidation and promote the soundness of social security systems, thereby strengthening confidence in the short term and economic growth prospects in the medium term. Maintaining the existing institutional framework and implementing it consistently is essential to safeguard the soundness of public finances and the macroeconomic environment. In the view of the Governing Council, the Stability and Growth Pact should not be changed, even though its implementation within the current framework could be improved further. A second issue we have discussed in depth over recent weeks has been the need to clearly step up the pace of structural reforms in the labour and product markets. In this connection, the Governing Council expressed concern about growth in euro area labour productivity having been on a downward trend since the mid-1990s. While this partly reflects improvements in employment, it is also the consequence of sub-optimal progress in fostering overall economic efficiency. Reaping the benefits of the technological advances and efficiency gains associated with producing and using new information and communication technologies requires, in particular, the removal of structural rigidities. In this respect, stimulating further product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, and facilitating industrial restructuring could speed up innovation and the adoption of the new technologies. At the same time, strengthening and spreading technological advances across the individual sectors of the euro area economy must go hand in hand with increased efforts to enhance human capital and adjust educational systems to the changing needs of the labour market. Since the mid-1990s, somewhat stronger average employment growth has partly compensated for the negative impact of lower productivity gains on overall output growth. However, despite past improvements in employment, the labour supply and its utilisation in the euro area remain low on international comparison. A relatively smaller proportion of the working-age population participates in the labour market, a higher proportion of those participating is unemployed and those who are employed work, on average, far fewer hours per year than elsewhere. Hence, there is a need for further policy changes in the euro area that underpin the labour supply and its utilisation and thereby raise the medium-term growth prospects, so as to preserve average living standards in the face of an ageing population. We are now at your disposal for questions. We have not judged particularly the situation of any particular member economy of the euro area, so I have no particular judgement on Germany. Of course, everything that goes in the direction of flexibility, everything that goes in the direction of reinforcing the overall productivity in the euro area goes in the right direction. Part of the difference that has been observed in terms of growth potential between the euro area economy and other economies in the world is clearly associated with the fact that progress in labour productivity was less substantial than has been observed elsewhere. So, again, if those reforms are going in the direction of more productivity, more efficiency, more competitiveness, they are going in the right direction. First, again, I repeat – and you will pardon me if I say something I said already here – we have an economic analysis and then a monetary analysis, and then we have a judgement on the balance of risks for price stability. The judgement we have on the gradual recovery proceeding is something which is part of our own economic analysis, which again has an impact on the balance of risks for price stability. So, on the judgement we have on growth, I would say that what we are observing now and what we have observed during the last months, goes in the direction of a confirmation of our working assumption of a gradual recovery. And we have a number of elements to substantiate that, particularly the fact that the private sector, private observers, have more or less revised upwards their overall judgement on growth in this economy, and particularly in the present year 2004. That being said, our judgement on the balance of risks for price stability is – for all the reasons I have explained – balanced. We do not change our monetary policy stance because our judgement is that it is balanced and that for the medium term we are in line with our definition of price stability. We have no bias and we are vigilant. And that would be my best summing-up of the mood of this Governing Council meeting: we have no bias, we are vigilant. We all have responsibility, all over the world. Certainly across the Atlantic the Federal Reserve has a very important responsibility, and it is not my responsibility to elaborate on that. We have our own responsibility: the US is the US and the euro area is the euro area! We are in different universes with different fundamentals and different episodes in the business cycle. Furthermore, we are both responsible for price stability in these different universes. So we are not influenced in any way by what has been decided across the Atlantic or what has been decided in the past across the Channel, or what has been decided elsewhere in the world. Because of our own analysis of the present situation in the euro area, we have not changed our monetary policy stance. Again, on the basis of European judgement and diagnosis we have no bias and we remain vigilant. Do not forget that we are responsible for inflationary expectations in the medium and long run. These inflationary expectations in the medium and long run are anchored by us, by our credibility. They are priced in the various market interest rates – both medium and long term – and the very good financial environment that we are providing to the European economy relies crucially much on our own credibility to deliver price stability. I hope so; transparency is the rule of the game. If we had a bias we would say that we had a bias. It is clear that there are risks: you have exactly the same figures, the same data, you know the environment, you see that the present level of CPI is 2.4 when it was 2.5 last month, you know our definition of price stability of less than but close to 2%. Everything we have as far as our own analysis is concerned is telling us that all things being equal – and, of course, do not forget that we are living in a universe where there is a lot of uncertainty – in the short term inflation will probably be higher than 2% until the end of the year and even higher than 2% for part of the first semester of next year. So we have to take that into account and that is part of the situation. We also have to say that in the medium term we consider that price stability will be in line with our own definition, but it is obvious that we have to take into account a number of risks and that is the reason why vigilance is warranted. But I repeat: we have no bias. Again, we have to follow the situation very carefully, because as you know the evolution of unit labour costs is absolutely decisive as regards the evolution of inflation. It is the combination of labour productivity and nominal increases in wages and salaries which make up the unit labour costs. I would like to insist on that: it is absolutely clear that unit labour costs are a crucial indicator of future inflation and a crucial indicator of competitiveness. We are in a universe where market economies function on the basis of comparisons between the competitiveness of corporate businesses and economies in general. So, to conclude I would say that I have no particular concerns but that vigilance in this area is warranted. As regards the monetary policy stance and the overall attitude of the Governing Council, I would say again: no bias – vigilance. I will not comment on that, I do not see how there could be a counterweight to the ECB. The ECB is independent, as you know, and the independence of the ECB is warranted by the present Treaty and by the Constitution. So I would interpret such ideas as aiming at having the best functioning possible of the executive branches within their own constituencies and of the Commission itself. The Commission has a very close association with the executive branches and with the Council, as well as other institutions, such as the Parliament. We are in the realm of responsibility of the Council, the Commission. For obvious reasons, namely because we have an extremely clear Treaty, it does not infringe, in any respect, on the ECB’s own realm of responsibility and independence. On the first point, again, I have to be extremely clear: we have no bias, full stop. What does that mean? That means that we look at the situation regularly, every month, we have our own sequencing of analysis and I do not signal to you that we are likely to do anything in the future. It is as simple as that. Every month we look at the situation and we will see what happens. Nobody is master of the future. But as this stage, clearly, we do not signal anything. As regards the labour market changes, globalisation and the impact on global inflation, it is clear that the forces of globalisation have played a very important role in keeping inflation low globally over the last few years. It is also true that we have had some indications, at the global level, of some inflationary pressure: you have the price of oil and you have the price of commodities in general. So you have a number of signals that we are going in the direction of the upside risks for price stability. I do not want to elaborate more on that but it is extremely visible and it is clear that the world is very complex and that you have a combination of forces that are pushing inflation at a global level down and others that are pushing inflation up. It is very fortunate that we have a global recovery. This is quite buoyant and therefore exerts pressure upwards. First of all, the BIS is an international institution which is important, with a close relationship, as you know, with central banks and which is there precisely to ask pertinent questions or to suggest further deliberations in important areas at the global level because it is a fully international institution. And I am very happy myself to participate in meetings in Basel under the auspices of the BIS, in particular the G10 meeting, the global economy meeting which we organise every two months. That being said, the question is stimulating. I trust that the question is not too much addressed to the ECB in your mind. But it is a theoretical question of great importance. Are we symmetric? Are we asymmetric? How do you deal with this very important question of asset inflation? What kind of responsibility do we have ourselves as central bankers when taking account of asset inflation? You know that we are reflecting a lot on that, that this institution has developed a special understanding and vision, and that we are a little bit original in the constituency of central banks the world over. We consider that on top of the possible interaction between asset inflation and possible bubbles and the monetary policy oriented towards price stability, which is the rule of the game for all central banks, we are keen ourselves on having a monetary analysis. And we trust that it is a way not only to better anchor inflationary expectations, because in the long run inflation is a monetary phenomenon, but also a way of perhaps taking more closely into account phenomena like asset inflation and bubbles because they are fed by monetary expansion. So we trust that perhaps – I say perhaps, I am cautious, I am prudent – our monetary policy concept is well-suited to this particular responsibility that is part of the overall BIS remark. It is a direct question. Only three comments. First comment: there is a consensus in Europe, as extraordinary as it might appear, on what you said, on the fact that it would be extremely opportune to embark on structural reforms and to do things that some other economies have already been doing over the past years. That consensus crystallised in 2000 in the so-called Lisbon diagnosis and Lisbon agenda, so the problem is not whether we are being listened to or not being listened to. We all agree on the necessity of these structural reforms and the problem is to implement those structural reforms, which is being done in some countries before your eyes, and before the eyes of the Governing Council, but which is obviously not very easy because of the sentiment of perhaps part of the population because of the fact that public opinion in general probably has yet to understand why it would be extremely important to make those reforms if we want growth, job creation and diminishing unemployment. It is certainly our collective duty to explain better, but there is no doubt that we all agree on the direction to be taken. You mentioned one particular country. I could have mentioned other countries myself. For instance, I could have mentioned Ireland, which is in the euro zone and is certainly a success story in terms of growth, in terms of GDP per capita and in terms of job creation, and again it is in the euro zone. Outside Europe, I could have mentioned Australia, which is a country that has introduced a lot of structural reforms on the basis very largely of a political consensus, and also of a social consensus, and these reforms are paying off also very well. There is a growing number of examples which prove that it is true that those structural reforms are delivering. Frankly speaking, it seems to me that all the criticism about the absence of transparency of the ECB can be taken with a grain of salt. Do you know another central bank that holds a press conference immediately after the decision of the monetary policy council? Do you know another central bank that produces four or five full pages assessing the situation, expressing the diagnosis, not in two paragraphs but in a more detailed way? Do you remember that, when we launched the single monetary policy concept of the euro at the start of 1999, the state of the art of central banking was to say absolutely nothing at the moment of the decision and to wait for five weeks before giving an indication of the reason why a decision had been taken? So, not only do we try to be as transparent as possible but also we, more or less, contributed to changing, for the sake of transparency, the state of the art of communication in central banking. So, all that being said, I cannot invent a bias where we have none, and change for your pleasure the assessment of my colleagues in the Governing Council. We try to do our best. We are under the control of public opinion. We are under the control of markets. We are under the control of savers and investors, and not only in Europe but the world over. On the basis of our credibility they are managing trillions of euro, and we try our best to maintain the credibility that we have in their eyes. And I mention this again because it is very important: we shipped to the euro area the yield curve that was the best yield curve available before the euro area was set up. That has made it possible to generalise for 306 million inhabitants a level of market interest rates that was previously the privilege of only a fraction of those 306 million inhabitants. To the extent that we started from scratch, this relied entirely upon the credit of stability that was given to us on the basis of our credibility. The credibility of the institution. The credibility, perhaps, of the transparent interaction with you and, through you, with the full body of observers, savers and investors. And also the credibility of our monetary policy concept, which – at the beginning – was perhaps criticised a little but it is now less and less criticised, it seems to me. First of all, on the particular cases which were mentioned previously, I avoided mentioning any particular economy – we are looking at the 306 million citizens – but I said that anything that goes in the direction of more flexibility, more adaptability to an environment which is extraordinarily demanding in terms of competitiveness, also goes in the direction of growth and job creation, of prosperity and diminishing unemployment. So we would strongly support across the entire euro area anything that goes in the direction of more flexibility. As regards unit labour costs they are a combination of productivity progress on the one hand, and of nominal wage and salary increases on the other hand. Having highly competitive unit labour costs is extremely important. As regards this institution, I will only mention that we have recently had social elections and we have a new staff committee with whom we will enter into discussion. It is perfectly legitimate for you to ask a series of questions which have a tendency to identify one element taken out of context to see whether it plays an important role or not – I take it that this is the aim of your question? What we do is to integrate all elements. We are in a very, very complex system and we have to take account of absolutely all elements. I used to say that we are not the prisoner of an equation, whether this equation relates our policy to exchange rates or whether it relates our policy to fiscal position or to wage and salary increases. We operate in a universe where we have to take account of everything and make a synthesis out of everything we have, to be sure that our decisions are robust and that they really take account of everything, including the uncertainty, which is part of our very comprehensive deliberations. And then we take a decision, which has to be explained to you as well as possible. I would not say at all that there are elements that were important in the past but are no longer important now. All elements have to be taken into account and, as you know, at any time there might be changes. We know today what the price of oil is and how we can judge the situation. We will see what happens as time elapses. All I can say is, again, that our judgement is made on the basis of the euro area, we judge the situation here on the basis of all data and figures that are here and we are not under any influence. We are in a symmetrical position – I assume that the Federal Reserve would not respond by saying “Yes, we are under the influence of the ECB, if they do this, we would do that”. We really have to live up to our responsibilities on both sides of the Atlantic, and this is what we try to do here. "
2004-06-03,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. However, I should first like to inform you about some decisions we have taken regarding the publication of staff macroeconomic projections. As you are aware, twice a year Eurosystem staff, that is, staff of the ECB and the euro area national central banks, jointly produce a set of macroeconomic projections. These serve as one of the inputs into the deliberations of the Governing Council. Subsequently, the projections are published in the June and December issues of the Monthly Bulletin. As you also know, in the interim period, that is, for March and September, ECB staff produce what is basically an update of the Eurosystem staff projections. These projections also serve as input into the meetings of the Governing Council, but so far have not been published. The positive experience and familiarity gained over the past few years with the publication of macroeconomic projections have given us the confidence to go a step further by also publishing the interim ECB staff projections. Therefore, in the spirit of transparency and accountability, the ECB staff projections will also be published from September 2004 onwards. In all cases, that is, four times a year, the projections will be published in the appropriate form in the Monthly Bulletin. In addition, as a further step towards providing relevant information in a timely manner, we will from today onwards provide you with an advance copy of the Monthly Bulletin section covering the projections. This advance copy will be made available shortly after the end of this press conference, both in hard copy and on the ECB’s website. The same procedure will be applied in September and every three months thereafter. The fact that we have decided to publish the interim ECB staff projections in future does not change their role as one of the inputs into our deliberations. The Governing Council continues to base its monetary policy decisions on a comprehensive economic analysis, which is cross-checked with the monetary analysis. Let me now turn to today’s monetary policy discussion. In summary, we noted that the economic recovery has strengthened over recent months. At the same time, we have also witnessed stronger inflationary pressures over the short term. Nevertheless, we are still of the view that the medium-term outlook remains in line with price stability. Accordingly, we left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The low level of interest rates continues to support the economic recovery. We will remain vigilant with regard to all developments which could affect the risks to price stability over the medium term. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data releases confirm that the economic recovery in the euro area is under way. According to Eurostat, real GDP grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of this year, and quarterly real GDP growth for the fourth quarter of last year was revised upwards from 0.3% to 0.4%. The more pronounced pace of real GDP growth mainly reflected both stronger private consumption and buoyant exports. Latest survey data still provide mixed signals with regard to the underlying strength of the recovery but remain fully consistent with ongoing growth in the current quarter. Looking ahead, the conditions for a continuation of the recovery remain in place. Economic growth outside the euro area continues to be strong and should promote export growth. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the positive global environment as well as from the favourable financing conditions. Improvements in corporate efficiency and higher profits are also supporting business investment. Moreover, private consumption should gradually recover from the stagnation witnessed during most of 2003, broadly in line with growth in real disposable income which, with the usual lag, should be further underpinned by an increase in employment growth later on. Accordingly, we expect an ongoing recovery in euro area economic growth over the coming quarters, leading to a broader and stronger upswing in the course of next year. This is also reflected in the Eurosystem staff projections, which envisage euro area real GDP growth of between 1.4% and 2.0% on average in 2004, rising to between 1.7% and 2.7% in 2005. Available forecasts from international and private organisations convey a broadly similar picture. With regard to this scenario, there are risks and uncertainties in both directions. On the one hand, the current rather robust pace of economic growth outside the euro area, the recent development in private consumption as well as some survey data imply a potential for stronger growth dynamics, particularly in the short term. On the other hand, high oil prices could pose a downside risk. Over a longer horizon, concerns also remain about the persistence of global imbalances. Concerning prices, recent oil price developments have created considerable upward pressure on consumer prices. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in May, partly due to base effects, after standing at 2.0% in April. Markets expect oil prices to decline gradually from recent peaks. If they were to remain at their recent high levels, it is to be expected that inflation rates would continue to be higher than previously anticipated and stay above 2% for longer than just a few months ahead. When assessing price trends over the medium term, however, the outlook remains favourable. In particular, overall import price developments should remain moderate and inflationary pressure from wages and unit labour costs should be contained. Both factors should help to bring annual rates of consumer price inflation back to below 2% in 2005. These views are in line with the Eurosystem staff projections, which put average annual HICP inflation at between 1.9% and 2.3% in 2004 and between 1.1% and 2.3% in 2005. They are also broadly consistent with recently released forecasts by international and private organisations. These forecasts and projections are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Concerns relate in particular to oil price developments. Moreover, there is insufficient knowledge today about future changes in indirect taxes and administered prices; information on these items typically becomes available only towards the end of the year. Against this background, the potential risk for second-round effects via wages needs to be monitored closely. Finally, there has been an increase in measures of long-term inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators. While these indicators should be interpreted with caution, the recent upward trend calls for particular vigilance. Moving on to the monetary analysis, we have seen increasing evidence of a normalisation of the portfolio behaviour of private investors. As a consequence, annual M3 growth has fallen quite significantly over recent quarters. Still, the low level of interest rates continues to fuel monetary growth and the amount of excess liquidity remains high in the euro area. In an economic upswing, the persistence of excess liquidity could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the main scenario for the outlook for price developments over the medium term remains in line with price stability. However, short-term pressures on inflation have increased recently and some upside risks need to be taken into account. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis also supports the case for vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability. Given the signs that the economic recovery will continue, it is particularly important that fiscal policies and structural reforms play their part in improving the economic fundamentals of the euro area. It is regretful that recent fiscal developments have not been helpful in this respect. A growing number of countries are reporting significant imbalances and fiscal consolidation efforts fall disappointingly short of commitments. In order to strengthen confidence in a sustainable upswing, it is now essential that clarity about the future course of consolidation of fiscal policies is re-established in all countries concerned. This requires credible measures with an emphasis on structural expenditure reform so that imbalances are redressed, tax/benefit systems become more growth-friendly and social security systems are put on a sound financial footing. These measures, together with a revived momentum towards effectively implementing structural reforms in labour and product markets, would provide very valuable support to the current economic upswing. We are now at your disposal for questions. The projections exercise is always a difficult exercise. And for all decision-makers and for all responsible institutions – and central banks are, of course, fully part of this constituency – decision-making is decision-making in an environment of uncertainty. This is the reason why we insist ourselves, as you can see, on using – I would say– “ranges” in our present staff projections, as I have mentioned; and again, I would stress the fact that these are Eurosystem staff projections, not Governing Council projections. I mean, they are one of the inputs that we take into account. So, again, it is absolutely clear that we have to take into account the uncertainty we are in. And while I will perhaps respond directly to a question on oil, which is part of the issue today, I am responding here to the general environment of uncertainty. There is an uncertainty in the oil area but also in a number of other areas. I will certainly confirm that following the analysis that we conducted today we, in the Governing Council, consider that we have all our options open, that we have no bias and that we are vigilant. First of all, as regards the transparency of the central banks, I have to mention again what I have already said quite a lot of times: first, that we are – to my knowledge – the first central bank in the world that has introduced a real-time display of the diagnosis of the Governing Council, of the monetary policy body. We were the first ones. We started the thing. We started the concept. We are still the only ones, to my knowledge, who publish a thorough diagnosis of the Governing Council in real time. And you will have this diagnosis – I have just read it and it will be published. Others publish short communiqués, not four or five pages of diagnosis. We probably remain the only ones among comparable central banks to have a press conference in order to be as clear as possible and as transparent as possible. For a number of reasons we consider that it is not opportune, as you know, to display the individual position of members of the Governing Council. I will not go on stressing the fact that we are very, very transparent. As regards the display and real-time publication of the projections I have been mentioning, I have already said what it was about; I will not say anything else about the minutes. And as far as the projections are concerned, I do not want them to play a dominant part in this press conference because they are, as you know, only one of the inputs. They are not the input. So, I would prefer perhaps for you to have the full explanation of the projections, with all the assumptions that have been made, immediately after this press conference. If we discussed that here, then this would be moving away from the normal explanation of the monetary policy decision that we took today. According to the data which have been published for the first quarter, domestic demand in the euro area has started to play a part in the growth that we are observing. And you might remember that this growth – which has been observed for the first quarter – has exceeded expectations. Still, we have mixed signals and we are analysing the various signals we have very carefully. On the confidence side, they are not all that positive. We remain very keen to capture all the new information that is coming. On other sides, for example the PMI, you might have observed that the recent indication on the industry side – and the most recent indication today on the services side – have been quite encouraging, signalling that a recovery is under way. So, we are in a situation where we consider our working assumption of recovery to have been confirmed. You might remember that some of you expressed doubts about this some months ago: I had to answer a lot of questions about whether we were right in making that working assumption of a gradual recovery. I would say that all the data we have so far have confirmed that it was an appropriate working assumption, particularly for the first quarter. But, that being said, the information received may continue to be mixed and we continue to be very, very keen on analysing the new data and information and on being vigilant. On the third question, I have already said very clearly that we have all our options open, that we have no bias, and that we are vigilant. As regards your first question on oil, it is a very important issue at the current juncture. If the present levels persist, the price of oil would have both a dampening influence on growth and an immediate upward effect on inflation. Both effects are highly unwelcome in the present circumstances. This is why we and a number of other institutions and authorities urge oil producers to be responsible so that the present episode would be transitory. But it is certainly too early to assess whether we are witnessing a transitory episode – as we would wish – or whether we have to take into account a more persistent level of prices. Under the current circumstances, the responsibility of the ECB is to prevent second round effects which would make higher inflation a permanent feature, which would prevent us from ensuring price stability and which would hamper sustainable growth. And there I insist: we have to prevent the second round effects. This is why we have to be vigilant. And it is also why we call on social partners to be responsible. On your second question on the dilemma of any central bank, may I remind you once again: we are responsible for price stability. The magnetic needle of our compass is price stability. The decisions on the monetary policy stance are based upon a final judgement on the balance of risks to price stability. The fact that we are credible in maintaining price stability in the medium and long run is per se a decisive contribution to growth. This is because the inflation expectations in the medium and long run are priced in the market interest rates. The full body of the yield curve is made up of the pricing in of inflationary expectations. The success of the transition to the euro has been the success of providing all 306 million inhabitants of the euro area the kind of very low market interest rates that were previously the privilege of only part of the euro area, not of the whole euro area. So, by being as vigilant and credible as possible in delivering price stability in the medium and long run, we make a decisive contribution to growth and job creation. That is very kind of you, madam. First of all, I will not comment at all on the first question. These are monetary issues that have a market influence and I will certainly not comment on issues of that nature. We are speaking of the possible functioning of ERM II and whether it was ERM I or ERM II we have never embarked on a policy of pre-announcing or pre-commenting possible future decisions. On the procedure, this idea is to apply the very same procedure that has already been set up. ERM II already exists, as you know: Denmark, the Danish krone is part of this mechanism and it is a collective mechanism, where the decision has to be taken by the members of the mechanism. There is no unilateral decision. There is no such thing as “I fixed my own position and the others will follow”. This is true, of course, for the newcomers, those who will join ERM II, as well as for those who are inside ERM II. Namely us, the ECB, on the central banking side, the executive branches and the Eurogroup on the executive side, and Denmark, whom we should not forget, because Denmark is fully part of this mechanism. I will say that it is our collective and collegial responsibility to have ERM II function in the best possible way. ERM II has served the euro on the one hand and the Danish krone on the other hand very well for some time now. As regards the monetary analysis, first of all, you remember that when we clarified and communicated our monetary policy strategy, we explained at length why we believe it is important to have a monetary analysis, why the monetary analysis is based very much upon our utmost conviction that in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. And I have to say that there is a great deal of support for this view in all circles, including academic circles. At the same time, we explained that because it was important in the medium and long term, we judged that it was not appropriate to review the reference value every year. We considered that the 4.5% reference value should be seen in a medium and long-term perspective. We still have that reference in the medium and long-term perspective. It still exists, it has not been changed or modified in any respect. We believe that it is extremely important for any central bank, and I would say in particular for the ECB, to firmly anchor medium and long-term expectations. I do not want to repeat what I have already said, about the importance of maintaining the benefit of the present yield curve for the full body of the euro area. We consider that the fact that we have this cross-checking with the monetary analysis is one element among others which contributes to a better anchoring of medium and long-term expectations. I will have to read the analysis to which you refer, but again I see more and more understanding of what I just said in all observer circles, watchers in general and academic circles. My memory is that these remarks were very much concentrated on fiscal positions and I take it that the IMF would recommend that in all countries, not only in Europe, if I am not misled, but all over the world, there should be some kind of objective, independent authority to assess the situation, without necessarily making any recommendation, without taking any sides as regards fiscal policy. Rather, it would take an objective view of the current situation: what are the facts, what are the figures? I must say, on a personal basis, because we have no Governing Council position in this respect, that it seems to me very opportune to eliminate all kind of ambiguity as regards the facts in this domain as well as in all others. And if we could go in this direction I believe that we would all be better off: of course, first of all the countries concerned and certainly the Eurosystem and the European Union as a whole – the remark was, if my memory is correct, about the European Union as a whole – and I can tell you that it is also a recommendation which is made by this institution to all countries. As I said, it is our responsibility to deliver price stability, it is our responsibility to be credible as far as medium and long-term expectations are concerned. It is the duty of all central banks in the world to be successful in these two domains. You might remember what you were asking for in your questions here only a few months ago? I do not want to elaborate on that! We said that our overall analysis of the situation was such that we judged it inopportune to go in the direction that had been suggested at the time, and I would say that most of what we said proved to be well-founded. I have said what I had to say on oil and I do not want to repeat myself. We believe that the combination of past decisions – which we sometimes took against strong advice to the contrary – and vigilance – which is, as we say, of the essence now – will permit us to deliver what it is our duty to deliver. And again we are judged by yourselves, by market participants and by all observers. We have very important responsibilities and we are subject to the scrutiny of all. I never embark on dialogues with various governments. We have a responsibility for 306 million inhabitants and for taking into account their superior interests. I would only say that the Eurogroup is very important for us. The Eurogroup is the executive branch counterpart – and certainly I would not speak of a “counterweight” since I don’t think it is appropriate at all, but of a “counterpart” to the European Central Bank and the Eurosystem. We have also the Commission, which plays a very important role in Europe as you know. We invite the President of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner every fortnight to participate in the Governing Council, not to vote of course, but to be there – to be present. This is a very, very frequent occasion on which we can meet. I won’t comment any more on that. The Eurogroup certainly has very important responsibilities and these responsibilities are decisive for the European Economic and Monetary Union – EMU. It is not only a monetary union, it is an economic and monetary union, which is one of the reasons why we consider so important the fiscal side of the coin and on the Stability and Growth Pact. On this very important question, which is the Constitution, we all rely very much on the wisdom of the Irish Presidency, and I will not comment on the details of what the Irish Presidency is preparing. That is really its responsibility. I was, myself, in Dublin recently. I had the privilege of being invited by our colleague John Hurley and I took advantage of my stay to be received by Bertie Ahern, the Prime Minister, and Charlie McCreevy, the Minister of Finance. I am very grateful for this occasion of direct contact. We put in writing the sentiment of the Governing Council. I sent a letter to Mr Cowen, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Again we rely on the wisdom of the Irish Presidency. Of course the mention of price stability is absolutely decisive to us. I don’t want to go back to what I have said on the necessity of anchoring inflation expectations, not only in the short term, but in the medium and long term. This is decisive. On the second question, we urged the oil producers to take account of the situation and be responsible so that the present episode that we have been witnessing for the last few days and weeks would be transitory. The decision that has been taken is a step in the right direction and I do not want to comment any more on that. As regards the uncertainties and risks for the growth and credibility of this working assumption of a gradual recovery, which is materialising, I do not want to say more than I have already said. Of course, the main issue in the eyes of a great number of observers is certainly the oil issue. But we have other elements in the euro area and, as I have said, some are going in the direction of more buoyant growth. I have to remind you that, in the first part of the year, most of you here were more pessimistic about what you thought was materialising. The first quarter has been better in this respect than most observers expected. So we have to be prudent and cautious. There are uncertainties and risks in both directions and that is why we have to be very vigilant and alert, and keen to get all new information and to introduce this new information into our own assessments. That is why we keep our options open. That is why we do not have a bias. Again I remind you that the magnetic needle of our compass is – for all the reasons I have explained – price stability. I do not want to comment again on that issue because I think I am giving a status to these projections that would not necessarily be the real appropriate status that they have in our own monetary policy strategy. But we did have such analyses and you can imagine what the various consequences of various possible scenarios would be. We do not claim to be oil specialists and we rely very much on analyses provided by a number of specialised entities. What I say in this domain is true for all others. We are in a world of a high uncertainty. In that uncertain environment what counts is that you take decisions that are wise and robust, namely that they are as optimal as possible, having worked through various possible representations of an extremely complex reality that cannot be summed up with any level of pertinence by a single mathematical economic model. It is very important to restate that we are pragmatic. We will respond to the changing reality as this reality materialises. Our own goal is to maintain price stability. I personally do not exclude any scenario. We could have this scenario you are mentioning as well as others. We are not dogmatic and we do not pretend that we are extra-lucid. But what we can say is that we urge the oil producers and all partners to maintain the highest possible level of responsibility in the present circumstances. Everybody knows what the consequences of sustained high prices are. But our own responsibility is to ensure price stability, namely to avoid the secondary rounds. That is what is decisive. That is where we concentrate our own action as a central bank. "
2004-05-06,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to welcome you to our press conference here in Helsinki, where the Governing Council of the European Central Bank met today for the ninth time outside Frankfurt. I would like to thank acting Governor Matti Louekoski for his invitation and very kind hospitality, as well as the staff of Suomen Pankki – Finlands Bank for a perfectly organised meeting. We deeply regret that Mr Matti Vanhala had to resign from his position and we wish him all the best. Let me now report on the outcome of today’s meeting. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we continue to expect that price stability will be maintained over the medium term. Accordingly, we did not change our assessment of the monetary policy stance and left the key ECB interest rates at their current low levels. The low interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum are also supporting the economic recovery in the euro area. As always, we will continue to monitor carefully all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. Allow me to elaborate on our decision, turning first to the economic analysis. Regarding the current situation and the very short-term outlook, the conjunctural indicators available still provide mixed evidence. All in all, they suggest that the recovery of real economic activity in the euro area has continued into 2004, albeit at a modest pace. Most recent information has been more encouraging, with the latest euro area survey data offering more positive signals with regard to the beginning of the second quarter. While the latest positive signals need to be confirmed by future developments, they underpin the expectation of the gradual recovery in the euro area continuing and strengthening over time. The conditions for such a recovery are in place. First, global economic growth continues to be robust and world trade has strengthened. The global economic upturn is broadly based, both geographically and across sectors, and thus provides a favourable external environment for the euro area. In this context, we expect euro area exports to grow significantly this year and next. Second, favourable financing conditions, improvements in corporate efficiency and earnings and the strength of global demand should help investment. Growth in real disposable income should support private consumption, especially since households appear not to face financial constraints that might impede stronger spending. Over time, consumer spending should also be supported by an improvement in labour market conditions. These considerations underpin our confidence in a continuation of the economic recovery, an expectation which is mirrored by available forecasts and projections. It is also in line with financial market developments over the past few weeks. Obviously, any forward-looking assessment is subject to risks and uncertainties. On the external side, the adverse terms-of-trade effects of recent rises in oil and other commodity prices pose risks at shorter horizons, while the persistence of global imbalances implies some uncertainties over the medium term. On the domestic side, uncertainties surrounding fiscal policy and structural reforms in some euro area countries seem to have contributed to preventing a more vigorous improvement in consumer confidence. A continued commitment to and greater clarity about the content and timing of these crucial reforms, supported by a better understanding of their necessity and benefits for all citizens, would help to resolve this uncertainty and thereby mitigate the associated risks for the euro area economy. Turning to price developments, annual HICP inflation rates will exhibit some short-term volatility over the coming months, as we already indicated on the occasion of previous meetings of the Governing Council. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in April, after 1.7% in March. While no detailed information is available as yet, the recent rise in annual inflation rates is likely to mainly reflect a strong base effect in the energy component resulting from the marked decline of oil prices a year ago. Moreover, recent oil price increases have exerted additional upward pressure. As these factors will also play a role in the next few months, inflation rates of 2% or somewhat above are possible over the short term. Despite these recent, less positive developments, over longer horizons we expect inflation rates to remain in line with price stability. In particular, wage developments should remain moderate. The latest data on wage growth in the fourth quarter of 2003 lend support to this view. Our outlook for price developments is in line with available forecasts and projections. However, at the current juncture, the increase in commodity prices in general, and oil prices in particular, may pose an upside risk to price stability. It will therefore remain important to pay close attention to inflation expectations. Moving on to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth has moderated only slowly since the summer of 2003. While there is evidence of continued portfolio shifts out of M3 into longer-term assets, the pace of this adjustment remains modest. Both monetary and credit growth continue to be supported by the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area and may also reflect the improvement in the economic environment over the last few quarters. Given the continued strength of monetary growth, liquidity conditions remain ample in the euro area. The impact of this high level of liquidity on inflation over the medium term will depend on future developments in the economy and financial markets. Should excess liquidity persist, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the main scenario for the outlook for price developments over the medium term is in line with price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis does not alter this view at the current juncture. As usual, I also wish to make a few remarks regarding other policies in the euro area. With regard to fiscal policies, the Governing Council sees increased reasons for concern. On the basis of the latest Commission forecasts, the average euro area budgetary position is not expected to improve much this year or next. A growing number of countries are likely to report significant imbalances, while fiscal consolidation efforts might fall short of commitments. It is essential that all countries concerned undertake credible measures to address these concerns. Such measures should be part of a comprehensive reform strategy. This would underpin the ongoing economic upswing by boosting confidence in sound public finances and by improving the prospects for future economic growth. The Governing Council welcomes the decision by the Commission to request more consolidation efforts from a number of countries. Turning to structural reforms, the Governing Council reaffirms its view that such reforms are essential if the euro area’s growth potential is to expand substantially. In particular, both our employment rate and our labour productivity growth need to increase significantly. Following our discussions here in Finland, let me stress that this requires a strengthened technological and scientific base and its application in the euro area as a whole, fostered by major efforts to enhance the human capital of our economy. In this context, we are particularly concerned that youth unemployment remains high in several countries. In order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to strengthen the implementation of structural reforms, both at the European and the national level. The Lisbon agenda provides an excellent diagnosis of the problem and we have a good understanding of the measures needed to deal with it. We strongly support the ongoing reforms, which should be speeded up across the euro area. It is important to understand that everyone will be better off – with higher growth and more jobs – if and when the reforms of the Lisbon agenda are delivered. We are now at your disposal for questions. Each particular central bank is following its own policy in its own environment, of course. And all environments are different, in the U.S. or in the U.K. or anywhere in the world, or in the euro area. So, as regards our own position, I made it absolutely clear that we did not change our previous assessment. Namely, that we keep all our options open and we have no bias. And we did not change our assessment. What happened in the U.S. or what happens anywhere else in the world did not change our assessment. We are, as you know, pretty well integrating all information, all data, all forecasts and projections available without excluding any of them. And it is the mark of our own concept of monetary policy not to be exclusive, not to eliminate any available data or information. As I said very often, we are not the prisoner of any equation or system of equations. So all I can say is that we have exactly the same analysis as regards the balance of risks. And, therefore, the same conclusion as we had a month ago. We had new information, we had new indications, as I have mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council, we had mixed signals. The most recent ones, including the PMI, as you know, were more positive and have been noted by all observers as being more positive. And when all this is taken into account we confirm our previous diagnosis. On the first point, I would only say that we are welcoming Governor Liikanen when he comes – I have already paid homage to Mr Louekoski and his invitation, and spoken about Matti Vanhala – and we are absolutely sure that we will work in the best possible fashion with Mr Liikanen. As you know, the Governing Council is a group of members with very different experiences, all sorts of backgrounds, and we are a very diverse group in this respect. So I do not want to comment on the experience of any particular Council member. But what is clear is that we make a collegial assessment and a collegial decision which has a very broad basis in terms of horizons and experiences. As regards inflation, as I said one, two, maybe even three months ago, we expect a hump in inflation in the months to come. We are seeing this already now, with the latest information, and I mentioned that we probably would have inflation over 2% in the next months to come. But at this stage this does not change our diagnosis that inflation and price stability are in line with our definition, that inflation is under control over the medium term. From that observation and diagnosis we derive our conclusion that we will not change our monetary policy stance. We will see when the time comes whether we will change anything. It is clear that oil prices are exerting an influence. They are also very volatile. I have already said that I was expecting, as were a number of other institutions in the world, that the partners that have an influence on the price of oil would exercise their responsibilities. Because it is a matter of great importance. Well, these are two different questions, of course. One is how the distribution of growth the world over will operate and how the division of labour and the optimisation of the division of labour will proceed in the global economy. The second question concerns inflation. I have already said what our judgement on inflation is and how we judge the situation today. We have noted, of course, that oil prices and commodity prices represent a risk, but nevertheless we consider that, over time, we have inflation under control. We will observe everything that happens and we will introduce all the new data and information that I have mentioned into our analysis, to the extent that they change over time. As regards the question of the division of labour and of the comparative advantage in the sense of Ricardo, I would say that we are living through a period of time when a large part of the emerging world and of the world in transition is catching up. It is of course what we have wished during the last fifty years. We wished that the so-called developing world would progressively improve its position. It is now improving, obviously, and when we look at global growth, we see that the emerging world and the world in transition are improving and are growing rapidly. This is good for global growth, it is good for the entire world. Of course, it also calls for adaptation in the emerging world and in the industrialised world, and this is the reason why we mention the importance of structural reforms, which would permit our economies to be more flexible and precisely to adapt more efficiently to these new opportunities. Because global growth is an opportunity, and we recognise this. Growth in the emerging world is an opportunity, and it calls in the industrialised world for flexibility and the ability to adapt. We all agree on that. Because as you know, the Lisbon agenda is based on a consensus. We all agreed on the Lisbon agenda. Executive branches at the level of heads of state and government approved it. And of course the Commission presented diagnosis and the ECB has always backed it. At a global level – because we have to analyse this at a global level – I would say that the overall consensus is that we are experiencing an episode of rapid and confirmed growth, and of course this diagnosis has not changed with the most recent events. That being said, I have mentioned – and I am not the only one to have done so – that each partner has to live up to its responsibility. And this responsibility is not to be neglected as regards the price of oil. That is clear. No … I would say that I am very happy that we have this gold agreement, which has certainly been very, very useful at a global level. As you know, it is up to each particular national central bank to say what they want to say. There is a collegial, collective commitment which has been made public by the signatories of the accord and it is up to each of them to say what they want to say. So, as you have been mentioning, perhaps the Bundesbank said something, perhaps the Banque de France said something. But it is not for me to describe their position. What is sure is that the market, external observers and the entire world know what the ceiling is for the sales of gold year after year, period of twelve months after period of twelve months. Well, again, I do not want to comment on the day-to-day evolution. It is not the way we operate. So, we will see what happens. I only wanted to mention that as a risk, but the level of oil and commodities prices that we have observed during the last weeks does not change at all the assessment that global growth is very robust, as I said, and is helping the economies of the entire world to be in an environment which is favourable to growth. It does not hamper in any respect our analysis or our confidence that inflation is under control. It is a risk. We analyse that risk. And, as I said, every partner has to live up to its responsibility, but I do not want to comment any more on that. Again, our diagnosis is clear and it incorporates the price of commodities and the price of oil. Well, each institution in Europe has its own responsibilities and we said publicly that we would support the Commission in its very difficult task. And today I delivered our judgement on the various threats that we see. We follow what happens extremely closely and we back the Commission’s analysis at this stage. We will continue to watch what is happening. We of course encourage all governments and parliaments concerned to embark on the appropriate measures necessary, in our view, to maintain and improve confidence of economic agents in general. In particular, confidence in the household constituency. I think that, first of all, this is an occasion for me to celebrate the recent accession of ten new countries to the European Union. The ECB’s Governing Council has already had an opportunity to say that it was an historic event which was of utmost importance for all of us, for Europe. Our vision of the accession is a positive one and we trust that it is an opportunity for everyone, for the ten new Member States and for the 15 “ancient” ones, and we are extremely positive about that. We also noted that all of these economies and countries entered without an opt-out clause. So they all intend to join the euro area when the time comes. We have also made it clear, and I trust that each of the ten national central banks and certainly each of the ten countries shares our view, that preparations for this must be carried out very professionally. This is, of course, not only in the interests of the economies concerned but also in the interests of the euro area as a whole. This is so that all of the criteria laid down in the Treaty can be met – not only as nominal criteria, but also on a sustainable basis, as the Treaty says. And again, it is in the interests of everyone: both all the economies concerned and all the countries concerned, because when you enter the euro area it is for eternity. So you have to be sure that sustainable convergence is there. I am very confident and trust that, together, we will – because it is a multilateral decision-making process, of course – find the appropriate way forward. I do not want to mention any kind of time-frame for this. We will see on a case-by-case basis how best to optimise the entry of each individual country into ERM II first and then into the euro area. Again, this process must be carried out very professionally, in a very serious manner, and I trust that we all understand very well that it is in the interests of all of us. First of all on the growth potential of Europe. As you know, the reason why there is a consensus in Europe on structural reforms – and we are very keen to communicate this element of the European consensus – is precisely because we trust that those structural reforms will permit an increase in the growth potential of Europe, which is below what could be observed if we had the structural reforms. It is also below what a number of other industrialised economies are displaying, including the U.S. And then a complicated series of analyses because – as you have mentioned – not all institutions, not all academic circles have exactly the same analyses on the present level of growth potential in the U.S. or growth potential in any other industrialised economy or growth potential in the euro area. I would not comment on any recent change in our own analysis in this respect. What is important is to observe that we have ample room for improvement and that the recipe for improving is simple to explain and to list. Perhaps less simple, unfortunately, to deliver for obvious reasons. As regards market expectations, I would only say that we keep all our options open and we have absolutely no bias. And this is today exactly the same assessment as the assessment we had a month ago. It is up to all of us to observe what market observers or economists are thinking. But our position is crystal clear. Again, with the mixed signals that we have, including the most recent ones, which have been more positive – I have mentioned the PMI –we have not changed our assessment of a gradual recovery, which is materialising and proceeding under our eyes and your eyes. From this and all other elements and inputs that we had, we came to the conclusion that the risks to price stability were balanced. And that is the reason why we say that we keep all our options open and we have no bias. I think it is a very good question which permits me to remind all of us how we proceed according to our concept of the monetary policy strategy. We have an objective, which is price stability. We have to deliver price stability and we have to be credible in delivering price stability. This is not only our mandate as defined by the Treaty, but it is also something that is fundamental to the favourable financial environment of Europe as a whole. As I have already said and I emphasise the point, we have a yield curve today for 306 million inhabitants which is the best yield curve that was available in the euro area before we merged the various currencies. And this is necessarily based upon inflationary expectations and price stability expectations that are the best expectations which were available in the euro area before the merger of all currencies. So, as I speak today, we are very credible on delivering price stability, according to our own definition of price stability. This is proved by the market rates that we have been and are observing on a two-year, five-year, ten-year or thirty-year basis. So, by having the needle of our compass pointing to magnetic north, which is price stability, we not only are implementing our very clear mandate but we are meeting the necessary conditions for creating and pursuing a very favourable financial environment for all maturities of loans. And that is a major contribution to growth and job creation in Europe. Thank you very much. "
2004-04-01,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome again to our press conference. Before I proceed, I would like to remind you that I have conveyed the Governing Council’s sincere condolences to Jaime Caruana, Governor of the Banco de España, following the terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004. I assured him of the Governing Council’s total solidarity with the Spanish people and the Banco de España. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analysis, we have not changed our assessment that the current stance of monetary policy remains in line with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, the key ECB interest rates have been left unchanged. The low level of interest rates also provides ongoing support to the economic recovery in the euro area. We will continue to monitor carefully all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. Let me now provide a more detailed explanation of our decision, turning first to the economic analysis. With regard to real GDP growth, it appears that the recovery in the euro area has continued into 2004, following quarter-on-quarter growth rates of 0.3-0.4% in the second half of 2003. Recently released data on production and demand as well as confidence indicators have been mixed, implying some short-term uncertainty, while preliminary information available after the tragic events in Madrid on 11 March does not suggest a major impact on confidence. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. On balance, there is currently no evidence challenging the assessment of continued, though modest, real GDP growth in the euro area over the short term. More fundamentally, the conditions remain in place for the recovery to continue in 2004 and to strengthen over time. First, global economic growth is robust and broadly based, both geographically and across sectors, thereby providing a positive external environment for the euro area. In this context, we expect euro area exports to grow significantly this year and next, despite some past losses in price competitiveness. Second, on the domestic side, investment should be helped by favourable financing conditions, an improvement in corporate earnings and spillover effects from global demand trends. Some signs of an improvement in fixed capital investment are already discernible in the Eurostat data for the fourth quarter of last year. As regards private consumption, growth in real disposable income should lead to increased spending, in particular because there are no financial constraints for households which would pose obstacles to higher expenditure. Over time this should also be fostered by an improvement in employment and employment expectations. This is our assessment and it is supported by the available forecasts and projections. Obviously, any such forward-looking evaluation is conditional and subject to risks. At this juncture, risks are primarily related to the persistent imbalances in some regions of the world and the weakness of private consumption in the euro area. Concerning private consumption, European citizens who still perceive that inflation is higher than measured by official indices should be assured that the official measures are accurate and that we will continue to maintain price stability in the future. Moreover, the prevailing uncertainties surrounding fiscal policies and structural reforms in some euro area countries may have had a negative impact on consumer sentiment. Ensuring clarity about the content and timing of these reforms and a better understanding of their benefits to all citizens would make a very important contribution to supporting household confidence. Turning to price developments, we expect some short-term volatility in HICP inflation rates to continue. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual inflation in the HICP was 1.6% in March, unchanged from February and down from 1.9% in January. However, over the coming months, annual inflation rates could edge up again, on account of less favourable base effects and increases in indirect taxes. Looking beyond these short-term fluctuations, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability. Given the anticipated gradual pace of the economic recovery, wage developments should remain moderate. The latest data on wage growth in the fourth quarter of 2003 lend support to this view. Moreover, the past appreciation of the euro exchange rate will continue to alleviate import price pressures and dampen the inflationary impact of higher oil and commodity prices, which are also related to strong demand at the global level Again, this outlook for price developments is in line with available forecasts and projections. Given their conditional nature, we will continue to monitor all indicators closely. In particular, the increase in commodity prices and the evolution of long-term inflation expectations deserve close attention. Turning to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth has been moderating since the summer of 2003, though only slowly. At the same time, the growth of loans to the private sector has been edging up. Both monetary and credit growth seem to be supported by the low level of interest rates prevailing in the euro area and may also reflect the improvement in the economic environment since the summer of 2003. Given the strong M3 growth over the past few years, there is currently more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. The effects of this high liquidity on inflation over the medium term will greatly depend on future developments in the economy and financial markets. Should excess liquidity persist, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. To conclude, the economic analysis continues to indicate that the outlook for price developments in the medium term is in line with price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis does not alter this picture. Let me also make a few remarks on other policies in the euro area. With regard to fiscal policies, the Governing Council sees continued reasons for concern. Recent information indicates that significant imbalances are emerging in a growing number of countries and that current policies would not be sufficient to attain the consolidation objectives specified in the latest stability programmes. We strongly urge governments to take corrective action in a timely and sustained fashion, where and when necessary. Finally, with regard to structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomed the Presidency conclusions of last weekend’s Brussels European Council. Structural reforms are necessary to meet the Lisbon challenge and thus reap the benefits of higher sustainable growth and employment. As pointed out by the European Council, the pace of reform needs to be significantly stepped up and the critical issue now is the need for better implementation of commitments already made. Ending the political uncertainty and delays surrounding the implementation of sustainable fiscal policies and effective structural reforms would indeed support private sector confidence, which would add momentum to the economic recovery in the euro area, given the supportive stance of monetary policy. We are now at your disposal for questions. Well, on the first point, I would say that, as we do every month, we have of course looked at all the elements that are pertinent to our overall analysis. We have, and we had, to take account of the price of oil and it is perfectly clear that any increase in the price of oil creates a problem as regards price stability and inflation. And it also has an impact on the global recovery. So I would not elaborate more on that. But that is pretty clear, pretty clear for us, and pretty clear for all observers. As regards the future Helsinki meeting, I cannot say anything in advance, but I am looking forward to being in Helsinki. It will be a great pleasure to be there and I expect the best to come out of the meeting we will have there. I’m sure it will be very well organised by the central bank of Finland. We are presently looking at it. We have not yet expressed an opinion but we will do that. And I have to say at this stage that we are actively working on it. But I cannot give you any particular sentiment on behalf of the Governing Council. So, we work and we will give our opinion as soon as possible. The analysis that I have just presented on behalf of the Governing Council is very clear. We have an analysis of the balance of risks to price stability, which leads us to the conclusion that the present level of interest rates is the kind of level which ensures price stability. Let’s not forget that the “magnetic north” on our compass is price stability. It is always this balance of risks to price stability that we are weighing. We are, of course, incorporating all elements that are pertinent. And among those elements there are a lot of data, figures, surveys, hard data, and so forth that are coming from the real economy. I mentioned that they were in some respects mixed but, overall, we believe that they do not lead us to change our overall assessment of the gradual recovery. And you know as well as we do what the various indicators are. We even had a new one this morning. And all this, put together, leads us to the conclusion that our working assumption of a gradual recovery is the appropriate diagnosis at the present moment. And, of course, we remain very alert and incorporate any new information that we can have, as we do month after month, according to our concept of monetary policy, which is, again, to ensure price stability. On the first question I will only say that, on the necessity of structural reforms, there is an overall agreement in Europe. Of course, an agreement of the EU Council, which just reiterated this commitment and this diagnosis. And, as you know, we have welcomed this position of the Council at the level of Heads of State and Government. We have said, from the very beginning, that structural reforms were, in our view, extraordinarily important. And we trust that it is the position of the Commission, so that there is unanimity – unanimity of governments, unanimity of institutions. That being said, we have to explain, tirelessly, why every citizen of Europe would be better off with the reforms that are needed. And we have tried ourselves to help as best we can. And I firmly believe that it is very important to be as convincing as possible in explaining how our economy works and why we would be better off in all respects – growth, job creation, prosperity. As regards the atmosphere, we conduct a very, very profound analysis of the situation every month. And I believe that it is important for you to know that. We conduct a full examination of the situation through our own grid of analysis – namely, what is the balance of risks to price stability, incorporating all elements. I have already mentioned that we were as comprehensive as possible. And we feel very much akin to those central banks that want to incorporate all possible elements. That being said, we take a decision, and we explain the decision. And we are, in that respect, the most transparent institution in the world. After this very comprehensive and lively discussion every month we are able to deliver our analysis in real time and to explain. As regards the position that we have expressed, we believed that it was necessary to explain even more explicitly what our policy diagnosis was, and I quote – as it has been analysed very carefully – “on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analysis, we have not changed our assessment that the current stance of monetary policy remains in line with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term”. I think it is important to say that. And it states exactly what our present analysis is. “Appropriate” is shorter. What I just said is longer and more explanatory. But do not believe that the previous “appropriate” would mean no change in the future, in the many months to come, for a very long period of time. It was not our intention to say that. We look at the situation month after month, on the basis of a concept of monetary policy which is known to everybody, on the concept of a yard stick – our definition of price stability – which is known to yourself and the entire world. Our concept of monetary policy is as public as it can be. sound problem for technical reasons … we took note of the commitment of France, we took note of the commitment of the majority of the Council, which has said very clearly that it would activate the sequencing for sanctions in the event that these commitments were not met. We have said that the Pact should not be changed. Nobody is calling for a change in the Treaty. We said that the secondary legislation, namely the Stability and Growth Pact, itself enshrined in the secondary legislation, should not be changed. And we said that we believed that we could improve the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact without changing the wording. Along different lines, which I do not want to elaborate on too much: more structural analysis, more understanding of what is necessary in the period of fat cats and affluent episodes in the economic cycle. That is our position. We are not changing our position. And today we reiterated our position that we were urging governments to take corrective action in a timely and sustained fashion, wherever and whenever necessary. And this, of course, deals with the particular cases you have been mentioning. On the first point I would only say that in the view of the Governing Council of the ECB, both the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact have to be applied to all. Therefore we maintain our position. I have no comment other than to refer to what I have just said on our position. This is valid for all of the current 15 Member States and for all newcomers. As regards the IMF, we have not been asked. As you know, and as the Vice-President has said, we give advice as regards our own board members, as we did today. I have no comment on what could be done in the case you mention since it is the responsibility of the executive branches to reflect on this particular question. Again, what we do is analyse, as comprehensively as possible, every month – as we did this month – the overall situation. We have to assess the balance of risks to price stability, which is the magnetic north of our compass. This analysis is carried out according to a concept of monetary policy which is crystal clear and has been clarified and explained and is, I trust, very well understood by European and global observers. By ensuring and being credible that we are correctly assessing this balance of risks, we contribute massively to helping Europe, because we give credit to the very low market rates that we are currently delivering. The rates would not be as low as they are if risk premia were incorporated to take account of inflationary expectations over and above our definition of price stability. So it is a way of helping Europe considerably. Another way of helping Europe is to ensure that we are credible in preserving purchasing power of the consumers. There are a number of other channels described in the textbooks that explain why price stability is a necessary condition for growth and job creation. I insist on these two channels because they are very much the focus of our attention today. Again, as I have said, we look at it every month on the basis of the full body of information available and we analyse this balance of risks. If the balance of risks changes, we can change – depending on the decision of the Governing Council – our own monetary policy stance. We could raise or lower rates, depending on this very comprehensive analysis. What I call the magnetic north of our compass is, per se, a means to help growth in Europe – and a very important one. I do not want to go back to what I have already said about the fact that the yield curve of the euro is today the most favourable yield curve compared with the situation in the euro area before the euro was set up. In itself, that is a major contribution to the overall prosperity of Europe. Again, we have a lot of information, some arriving even this morning, all of which is taken into account. I wouldn’t say that. When I look at the overall sentiment of the Governing Council, I think that we are in exactly the same mood. We look at the situation with a view to weighing the risks. The fact that we did not say “appropriate” this time should not be over-interpreted. We wanted to be as clear as possible about our present analysis, and that is the reason why we were more explicit. But the fact that we said it was appropriate a month ago did not mean that a month ago – and I have to say this because it is important that our dialogue is as clear as possible – we were excluding anything in the months to come. It was not the case. We reserve the right to analyse the situation at each of our meetings. And as we said, we have mixed signals, it’s very clear that we have mixed signals. Some are pointing in the direction of a more active recovery. Others are pointing in the other direction. We have to work out our diagnosis on the basis of all these signals. The idea that we would forget about the signals, the indications, the surveys and the hard data transmitted to us and stick to a predefined position is wrong. We look at all that, and we draw the appropriate conclusions. We did so in our previous meeting, and we did so in today’s meeting in the same fashion. Again, we are more explicit and I hope that you understand perhaps a little bit better what our permanent attitude is, which is that we have a magnetic north in our compass and incorporate all the information that comes in, to the extent, of course, that it is pertinent and informative. Again, I already said that we have no particular equation that would trigger our decisions. We have no particular system of equations. We have no algorithm. So, the exchange rates are one of the many inputs that we have in our overall analysis. For obvious reasons, because it has an impact on inflation to come, because it has an impact on a variety of economic indicators that are of extreme importance. So, we incorporate that as well as all the other elements. But there is no mechanistic reaction. We do not mechanistically react to an exchange rate evolution, as we do not mechanistically react to a fiscal position evolution or to any other evolution, such as oil prices and so forth. We incorporate that into this comprehensive analysis that we make and it is on the basis of the final sentiment we have after taking into account absolutely everything that we take our decision. We took into account, of course, the developments observed in the exchange rate as part of this very comprehensive analysis. First question: I have already explained that we wanted to be as clear as possible. I do not know how you yourself are interpreting the word 'appropriate'. I do not know. We said 'appropriate' when interest rates were appropriate because that was the case. But it seems to me that perhaps you are exaggerating the semantic meaning. What we wanted to communicate was clearly that the overall monetary policy stance was in line with what we deem good, useful, 'appropriate' if you want, and we did not express through the word 'appropriate' the sentiment that we would not change our monetary policy decision over the months to come. Perhaps it was something felt by a part of the market, but it was not what we intended to communicate. So there is nothing – in my opinion – which can be described as a fundamental change in our overall diagnosis. Our overall diagnosis is that today the situation does not call for a change in our interest rate and we will see during the next meetings whether or not there is information that would call for any change – in any direction. And now I come to the second part of your question. Taking into account all the new information we have had since the last meeting, including the most recent information that we had, we consider the situation to be balanced. We do not signal a bias. You know that we were never in favour of signalling any bias; that is part of our overall communication with markets. I have to say very clearly, we have no particular bias but we can change, and one has to understand that we can change on the basis of objective information that we receive. We would explain candidly – as transparently as possible – our monetary policy. And again, to elaborate a little more: since our last meeting, we have had – as I said – mixed signals. Some were pointing downwards, others were pointing upwards. Well, I take your second question first. As you might have seen in the diagnosis that I read a moment ago, we mention consumption and consumer confidence and we mention a number of elements that might explain why it is not as robust and dynamic as would probably be the case if we had a recovery which were less gradual. So it is important for us to explain how we understand what is going on. There are a number of reasons. We mention those reasons and I do not want to elaborate again on that. One of the reasons which might depend more on us is that consumers in Europe feel that their purchasing power is hampered, because they have a perceived inflation higher than real inflation. To them, and only for the part of the consumption which might be hampered by this sentiment, to them we say: we are there to be the good guardian of the currency. We do all we can to preserve your purchasing power. It is legitimate for us to say this because we are obviously – according to the Treaty – the guardian of price stability. We have the figures in front of us, you have the figures in front of you. We trust that a part of consumer confidence is linked to confidence in the preservation of purchasing power. This is really part of consumer confidence. What was your other question? I can see that we have a lot of nice interpretations that we are changing our monetary policy stance. You read them. I read them. Each and every month we incorporate all the new information. And those who think that we do not incorporate this information and do not analyse the situation every month are wrong. It is clearly what we do. That being said, the best contribution we can make to the recovery in Europe is to be the anchor of price stability, because being the anchor of price stability permits very low market interest rates, and permits an improvement in the confidence of consumers and reassures them that their purchasing power will be protected. These are the two channels through which we can help. If the balance of risks to price stability were to change, then we would change our own monetary policy stance. I cannot say anything else. I am explaining. It is not for me to re-interpret the interpretation. It is really exactly how we see things. We have a “magnetic north” in our compass. We are not blind. We are not deaf. We incorporate everything and we would change our monetary policy stance upwards or downwards on the basis of this balance of risks analysis. I will not comment on that. We are looking at absolutely all information which is available and, as I said, we did not change our analysis today. We said exactly what we believe on the basis, again, of our present analysis. Namely that we do not see at the present moment anything suggesting a significant impact. We do not exclude the possibility that such an impact could come, so we have again, in this domain as well as in others, to remain ready to incorporate any new information. But until now, and this is of course something which is reassuring, based upon all the information which is available right now, we do not see a significant impact on confidence. This was confirmed again this morning. Every member of the Governing Council who has expressed their views has been very balanced when you look at the full body of what they have said. Of course, from time to time, for reasons that I can explain to myself very well, you might have an amplification of one sentence and the reverse attitude for other sentences. So I do not want to elaborate more on that. I know that the full body of the Governing Council is thinking exactly what I said. We have our magnetic north. We take all the information, and again, there have been waves of information. Perhaps the overall environment has been quite negative at a certain moment, more positive at another moment, which is understandable, because it is a gradual recovery and we have mixed signals. But again, the overall sentiment of the full body of the Governing Council is very clear. At the present moment, we do not modify our working assumption of a gradual recovery and we consider that nothing goes against this overall, taking all figures, data, surveys and hard figures into account, and so we do not change our vision. It is important for you to know that we do not change our vision, because it means that the situation, in our view – and after this very comprehensive analysis – is a situation of gradual recovery. It is even more than that. And I thank you very much for that question because it is an important one. We do not fine-tune the economy. We do not reason as though we would like to speed up any part of the economy with a view to monitoring the output. We have a magnetic north, which is price stability. We believe that through price stability we can help to considerably improve the situation, the economic situation of Europe. I explained to you that through price stability we can improve sentiment among consumers because we can preserve their purchasing power. And that is a way to help – but through price stability. The balance of risks I am referring to is always a balance of risks to price stability, which is the ultimate decision-making step. All the other elements contribute to this balance; they include of course aggregate demand, which is a major element that we have to incorporate into this balance of risks. But again, we do not fine-tune the economy. If we were to fine-tune the economy, then it would be legitimate for global observers to think that we were more or less abandoning our magnetic north. And if we were abandoning our magnetic north, then risk premia would appear and we would have higher, not lower, interest rates. So, it is something which is extremely important to understand. We try to be as comprehensive and to understand as much as possible, and we go then through our own balance of risks. It is clear if aggregate demand is much stronger or weaker, then the balance of risks to price stability changes and we are legitimate in changing our interest rates, whether it is up or down. But it is through that grid, though that sequencing of analysis. You ask me to reiterate all that I have already said. So, I hesitate a little bit. We the ECB, we the Governing Council of the ECB, the Treaty itself and all the people of Europe who have ratified the Treaty, we all believe that price stability is a necessary condition for growth and job creation. That is absolutely clear. We stressed that we believe our present stance of policy is exactly in line with that goal, and we note that it is obviously helping, because we have the lowest interest rates in 50 years. That is undeniable. We have abundant liquidity in Europe, it is undeniable. It does not mean that we cannot change this policy stance if we have new information and if the balance of risks to price stability changes. And as I said, we could go up or we could go down. We are not blocked. But what we mean is that it has to go through the grid of the balance of risks to price stability, taking everything into account, as clearly as possible. Price stability is supporting the economy. If we have a low level of interest rates, it is not due to a random behaviour of markets; it is because we were skilful enough to pass on the best yield curve available in the euro area before the euro, to the euro. I refer to all rates. All rates are historically low. So it is not my fault, it is not the fault of the Vice-President and not the fault of colleagues. All rates are at their lowest. But again, I explained the situation sufficiently. I trust that it is understood. Again, I explain that we were in a position to analyse the situation as comprehensively as possible. To go back to what you said: it is clear that we are below potential, absolutely clear. It is also clear that we have the lowest interest rates since the Second World War. Moreover, it is clear that today we have a flash estimate which puts the level of HICP in the euro area at 1.6%. It is also clear, as you noted, that I said that we knew we would perhaps have a hump in the HICP in the months to come. We have warned you in advance of that: you remember we said last month, and even the month before, that there would be a hump because of a base effect and a number of phenomena such as indirect taxation. One has to know that. One has also to know that we do not look at prices in retrospect but in a more longer perspective starting around two years time. But we also pay a lot of attention to longer-term expectations of inflation, because our commitment is not only for the short-medium term – meaning around two years – but also the longer term. We have rates on the financial markets in Europe that are two, five, ten years and 30 years – even more than 30 years. And if the yield curve is the favourable yield curve that you know, it is because we are credible over a much longer period. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis is extremely important to permit us to have a longer-term view. We do not want necessarily to modify policy on a short-term basis because of what we are observing. And we explained why, despite the fact that there is very abundant liquidity, it does not drive us to consider that we have to change the balance of risks to price stability. But the fact that we cross-check with the monetary analysis on a longer-term perspective, we believe, ensures a better anchoring of long-term expectations for inflation. In our monetary policy concept, we believe that this cross-checking is very important. Therefore, I will not draw the conclusion that you drew. As you see, it is a more complex analysis. "
2004-03-04,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome again to our monthly press conference. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Overall, the Governing Council confirmed its previous assessment of a favourable outlook for price stability in the euro area over the medium term. Against this background, we concluded that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. The key ECB interest rates have therefore been left unchanged at their low levels. Our monetary policy stance provides support to the economic recovery in the euro area. We will continue to monitor carefully all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. Let me now turn to the details of our economic analysis. According to Eurostat, in the fourth quarter of 2003 real GDP in the euro area grew by 0.3% quarter on quarter, following growth of 0.4% in the third quarter. These data confirm that a gradual recovery in economic activity in the euro area took place in the second half of 2003. More recent indicators point to moderate economic growth also in early 2004. While growth has been relatively modest so far, both external and domestic factors give reason to expect a strengthening of the recovery through 2004 and beyond. On the external side, all recent indications confirm that global economic growth in 2004 will be robust and broadly based across different regions of the world. Overall, euro area exports should grow significantly this year and next. On the domestic side, the conditions for a recovery in private demand are in place. Over recent months there have been signs of a stabilisation in investment. According to Eurostat, fixed capital investment grew again in the last quarter of 2003, after recording three successive quarter-on-quarter declines. Corporate earnings have generally improved in the euro area, following a protracted restructuring of corporate balance sheets over the last few years. The financing conditions faced by corporations in the euro area are very favourable at present. All of these factors should support a further recovery in investment. There are also reasons to expect a gradual increase in consumption growth during this year, following the subdued developments of last year. In the short term, growth in real disposable income is supported by lower import prices and tax cuts, while later on the gradual improvement in labour market conditions should become an additional factor supporting income growth and confidence. The financial situation of households in the euro area is sound, not least in comparison with a number of other industrial economies, and there is no financial impediment to a pick-up in private consumption. For all these reasons, our main scenario of a continued gradual recovery in the course of 2004 and 2005 remains valid. This view is shared by available forecasts and projections, and is also broadly reflected in financial market developments. We continue to see the risks to this scenario as broadly balanced. However, there are uncertainties related to euro area private consumption and the persistent imbalances in some regions of the world and their potential repercussions on the sustainability of global economic growth. Turning to price developments, according to the Eurostat flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate declined to 1.6% in February 2004, from 1.9% in January. This fall was mainly due to base effects stemming from energy prices, as a sharp increase in oil prices which occurred in early 2003 dropped out of the calculation of the annual rate in February 2004. Over the coming months, volatility in annual inflation rates is likely to be observed, mainly due to further base effects from energy prices as well as to increases in indirect taxes. Related to this, annual inflation rates are likely to edge up again temporarily in the second quarter of 2004. Looking beyond short-term fluctuations in the most volatile components of the HICP, we expect inflation to remain in line with price stability. At the current juncture, we see little upward pressure on inflation. Given the anticipated gradual nature of the recovery in economic activity and the high level of unemployment in the euro area, wage developments should remain moderate. While our assessment is in line with available forecasts and projections, we are aware of the conditional nature of such exercises. We will therefore continue to monitor all indicators closely. Inflation expectations, in particular, deserve close attention. Turning to the monetary analysis, M3 growth has moderated over recent months. However, it appears that the reallocation of economic agents' portfolios into longer-term assets is proceeding rather cautiously. In this respect, the generally low level of interest rates continues to support the demand for liquid assets. The low level of interest rates also supports the growth of loans to the private sector. The high liquidity in the euro area needs to be assessed with caution. Its effects on inflation over the medium term will greatly depend on the extent and pace of the future reversal of past portfolio shifts and on the future strength of economic growth. Should excess liquidity persist, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis continues to indicate that the main scenario for price developments in the coming years is in line with price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis does not alter this picture for the time being. With regard to fiscal policies, we noted the progress in fiscal consolidation envisaged in countries' stability programmes. Nonetheless, there continues to be reason for concern. In some countries, contrary to their commitments, adjustment efforts are insufficient to mitigate the risk of excessive deficits. Moreover, several countries do not plan to attain sound budgetary positions by the end of their respective programme horizons, despite favourable growth prospects. This would risk a repetition of the policy errors of the last economic upswing, when insufficient consolidation efforts and tax cuts without adequate expenditure restraint laid the foundations for the recent fiscal difficulties. All countries would benefit from the strengthening of the sustainability of their public finances, especially in the expected upward phase of the cycle, by eliminating imbalances over the coming years and avoiding or correcting as soon as possible excessive deficits. Moreover, the determined implementation of comprehensive structural reforms, on both the expenditure side and the revenue side, will bring additional medium-term rewards in the form of higher growth and more sustainable public finances. Such consolidation and reform strategies are needed to secure a sound macroeconomic environment in the euro area. The euro area also requires further structural reforms in financial, product and labour markets. The Lisbon Strategy provides the appropriate blueprint for progress. We welcome that the forthcoming spring meeting of the European Council is set to give renewed impetus to the Lisbon agenda, speed up the pace of reforms, and strengthen the effectiveness of the decision-making process. Structural reforms will have enormous benefits for the citizens of the euro area. These reforms are crucial for sustained non-inflationary growth and employment, and they are therefore also important for maintaining social cohesion in the long run. Confidence among European citizens in the future is vital for a stronger economic recovery and sustained growth. The Governing Council recognises that the still low level of consumer confidence is related to prevailing uncertainties, including the debate about the appropriate path for structural reforms in many countries of the euro area. It is also partly linked to the continued perception by European citizens of higher inflation than measured by official indices. The Governing Council notes that inflation is now back at a level consistent with price stability. The European public can rest assured about our determination to preserve the purchasing power of our money in the years to come and thus make our contribution to enhance confidence in the future. Stable prices, together with further progress in the implementation of necessary structural reforms, are the key to stronger confidence, and they create the conditions for increased consumption and investment and thus for growth and job creation. We are now at your disposal for questions. No, I would say that we are not downgrading anything. We see the recovery as being gradual. And we said that already; there is nothing new in this observation that there is a gradual recovery under way. So, there is nothing new there. No, not at all. We have made very clear what our sentiments in this respect are. We have made it very clear at the level of the Governing Council and we made it very clear in signing the Boca Raton Communiqué. So, you should not read anything into that. We stick totally to what we have already said in this domain. First of all, on inflation. As you know, we are reflecting permanently. We have studies which are made by the staff. We do not publish them. You know that pretty well because I have seen this in all the articles which were written on this particular point. All I can say is that we are in full agreement with the sentiment that our definition of price stability will be reached. We are observing, as we say, a certain volatility, up and down, of yearly inflation on a month-to-month basis. We are happy to see the present level of inflation. We know that it will increase on account of base effects over the months to come, perhaps. We think it will not be a cause for alarm. And we firmly believe that we have inflation under control and that our definition of price stability is being reached. We know that it is important to say that to the European citizens, we know that some of them are afraid that price stability will not be ensured in the years to come. We tell them that they can have confidence. We are here precisely to reinforce their confidence. The Governing Council is the guardian of the currency, the guardian of price stability. They can have confidence. And, in our opinion, it is time for those citizens who are exercising a kind of self-restraint as regards consumption or investment to invest and to consume. This is very important and, as you can see, it is one of the important messages of today's Governing Council deliberations. As regards the deficit of the United States of America, we have said that it is part of an overall savings issue in the United States of America. And it is, of course, for the US to look at it in the most appropriate manner possible. It was one of our conclusions in Boca Raton, and we have already said – and I have already said myself – that the US government has said that they are taking steps to progressively diminish their public finance deficits over time. A clear public declaration was made to this effect by the Secretary of the Treasury. No, you mean the external surpluses and deficits? No, as you know, in Boca Raton we achieved a consensus on some messages; I do not want to go back to what has been said already because it would be a repetition, but it was pretty clear that there was a consensus among the participating authorities in the Boca Raton G7 / G8 negotiations. We said very clearly that for some areas in the world there was probably a good reason for a certain re-balancing. Well, we have already said this quite a lot of times. It was not at all the tradition of any of the national central banks in Europe to consider that they had, more or less, to tell the markets that they were forecasters. The tradition was to consider that they had to look at all forecasts and to take their decisions according to all that was available, but not to put themselves in the position of a forecasting institution. So we decided, after due and appropriate discussion with the European Parliament in particular, to embark on the publications you mentioned, and I think this is something which has been appreciated. I cannot say anything more, as the Governing Council has considered that it is not appropriate to go beyond that. We will, of course, reflect on this point. I would also like to remind you that, while a lot of work is done by our staff, of course, and we consider this very important, we also look at everything that is available on the market, everything that the international institutions are working on, everything that the European institutions are working on, and we also look at everything the private sector does. We take all of these things into account when we make our decisions. We know that we are in an uncertain universe and that we have to go through all detailed scientific analysis and then make our own judgement. I mentioned ""en passant"" a moment ago that we have to remain alert, to continue to incorporate new information, new data, new evidence, including hard evidence, and this is of course very important for the Governing Council. Ok, first question. We have a system which is very clear. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank takes a number of decisions. The President of the ECB is the ""porte-parole"", or spokesperson, of the institution, which has the unique and extraordinary responsibility of having to run a monetary policy, a single monetary policy, for 306 million citizens belonging to 12 different economies and countries. On the side of the executive branches, we have an organisation called the ""Eurogroup"", which is the college of the 12 ministers of finance of these countries, the members of the euro area, and we have the President of the Eurogroup, which is currently Charlie McCreevy, the Irish minister of finance, and we also have the Commission, of course. So, the equivalent of the executive branch is the combination of the Eurogroup, with Charlie McCreevy, and the role of Pedro Solbes and the Commission. We have an organised system, and when we were together in the United States for the Boca Raton meeting I was, if you like, the equivalent, the friendly partner, of Alan Greenspan, and Charlie McCreevy was opposite Secretary Snow. That's the organisation of Europe, and I believe that it is a good organisation. When we had to discuss very important questions, we did so in this format in a very expeditious and fruitful way with our US friends. You can see in the results of our discussion in Boca Raton a number of elements which perhaps give evidence of the fact that we had a fruitful and friendly meeting with results. The second part of your question was... At each meeting, as you know, we have to understand what is the overall concept of the Governing Council. I would say that we are firm, we are committed, we are pragmatic and we try to be confidence-inspiring. We are firm in our strategy, that is clear. We are committed as regards our goal of price stability, as I said. We examine the situation every month, and every month each member of the Governing Council rightly considers that we have to discuss the full context of the situation, including all data and analyses, with the possibility of concluding in any direction. So, I cannot help but say that this was certainly the case today, as it will be the case next month. We are pragmatic, we are realistic and we examine the overall situation with a high degree of pragmatism. And we try to be confidence-inspiring, as I say, we believe this to be very important. Confidence is perhaps the ingredient which is still a little bit lacking in some constituencies, particularly in the household constituency, in the consumer constituency. We believe that perhaps perceived inflation or the absence of sufficient confidence in price stability play a dampening role in this respect. We feel it is our responsibility to tell the citizens, our fellow citizens, you can have confidence, we are here, the situation is under control, perhaps more so than you think. It is time for you, if you wish and if you are hampered only by these fears, it is time for you to consume, it is time for you to invest. I do not share this view. We did not discuss that in the Governing Council and I can only tell you that I do not share this view. Taking the first question, I have mentioned a number of times that I never comment on market rumours. If I were to start commenting on market rumours it would be, of course, endless. Second, when we have something that we deem appropriate to say, we say it. That is for the first question. For the second question I would say that we hear and we listen – or I hear and I listen - and I know the Treaty. The general feeling in Europe, taking into account public opinion, is that we have to take our decision in full independence, meaning that we should not do something because we are told to do something. And that we should not do something because we are told to do the contrary. Namely, we should not be influenced in either direction. Frankly speaking, it is not that easy. But it is the strong belief of the entire Governing Council that we should not be influenced in any direction. So you can trust us to have looked at today's case on the basis of the situation today, as I have explained, as thoroughly as possible. And we will examine the situation next month in exactly the same frame of mind. Whatever is said, we are not to be influenced – either positively or negatively. First of all, taking the first remark you made, I should mention that Charlie McCreevy is not isolated. There is a large, indeed a very large constituency which would have exactly the same attitude as that of the President of the Eurogroup. On the second point, I think, of course – and we have said this very clearly – that confidence is made up of a great number of elements. Undoubtedly there is the recovery and the cycle and the labour market figures which all play their part in contributing to the present level of confidence in the household constituency. That is a very important point and is always something difficult in the cycle because it is some kind of pro-cyclical element which is in-built in the functioning of any society. Then, of course, there is public opinion regarding structural reforms. What we believe in is that when a government embarks upon bold and courageous structural reforms, as has been the case of a number of governments, it is good for everybody, for the full body of society. It is much better than to close our eyes and do nothing. And it is, perhaps, our duty to explain that and tell the general public that, because we are undertaking a reform, it should improve confidence, as it is something which benefits everyone. And, again, a pedagogical explanation is certainly very important in that respect. Furthermore, we have the feeling, which exists in a number of households, that with the situation differing from one economy to another, perceived inflation is higher than it is in reality and that future inflation might be higher than we trust it will be. And there, of course, we are in our own sphere of competence, we have the authority because we are responsible and fully accept this responsibility. Then we tell those households that if your confidence is hampered because you have that fear, you should not have that fear: you should trust us, you can have confidence in us. Papademos: It is a fact that, up till now, a number of countries have not yet ratified the change in the voting rules. But I believe that on the whole the prospects are good, that this ratification will be concluded on time, before the end of the month. We cannot be certain, of course, but I think on the whole the prospects are positive that this will be done on time. Well again, when we take a decision today, it is with an eye on what will be the situation within 18 months, two years. We are always thinking about the medium term. We have also a concept of monetary policy which is very important for anchoring long-term expectations and we have said that since the very beginning. One of the reasons why we are cross-checking the economic analysis with the monetary analysis is that it helps to anchor long-term expectations of inflation. This is very important, in turn, to permit a very low level of market interest rates, not only over the short term, but over the medium and long term, two years, five years, ten years, thirty years... This is part of the overall financial environment in Europe today which is, of course, very favourable and contributes to growth and job creation. That being said, we should never congratulate [ourselves]. We will see at the end of the year what will be the overall result. We are confident in the medium run, we have to remain as vigilant, alert and pragmatic as possible. But it is clear that if the Governing Council decides to pass on that message of confidence to households, it is with some good reasons, I trust. Well, I'll let the Japanese central bank be responsible for its policy and I would only say that Alan produced a very interesting speech recently, very interesting. I would say, on Eugenio, that we see him leaving the Executive Board with a sentiment of great, great, great appreciation. His contribution has been fantastic for this institution, and it is a sentiment that I would like to express, if the Vice-President permits, on behalf of both of us and of the full body of the Executive Board and certainly the full body of the Governing Council. I have no remark other than to say that what is very important in our domain is qualification. Qualification for the Executive Board and for the Governing Council. At our level, with our responsibility and considering all elements, this is absolutely key. The rest is in the realm of those who are taking this decision, namely the EU Council, taking into account that there is a sentiment to be expressed by the Parliament and that there is advice to be provided by the Governing Council of the ECB. The decisions are taken after those two pieces of advice have been given. I am sorry, are you concluding that we should increase rates or decrease rates? That is kind of you, sir. As you have mentioned yourself, we have a great number of indicators, and we have a great number of indicators which are volatile. Perhaps one day you will tell me: inflation is at this level, you should do this. And then next month, or two months afterwards, you say: inflation is at that level, you should do that. And then it is back to this level. So of course our reasoning, as I said, is based on a vision of the medium term and long term and we have, of course, a must – an absolute must for us – which is to be credible vis-à-vis all observers, savers, investors and public opinion that we will deliver, over time, price stability. You are like us, you see one day that indicator x is up, the next day or the next month it is down, and then up again and down. We have to make a judgement on what is the real situation and not be the prisoner of a day-to-day evolution, which is necessarily erratic. We have a low level of inflation, according to the last statistics. We know in advance that for statistical reasons it will go up again, and then perhaps you will say: today you should do this, and tomorrow you should do that. So we have to take everything into consideration and not only the early indicators that are related to, for instance, the economic cycle and the last indication we have of domestic demand, but also all indicators of inflation and what could happen as far as inflation is concerned. We have the cross-checking – you have been mentioning it – with the monetary development, and I said that it is important in a long-term perspective. We take all that, we make our judgement. I explained in four pages what our judgement was. There is no other central bank, we are the only one – I draw your attention to that – which immediately after having considered the situation, and under the observation of the full body of European and global observers and journalists, produces its own assessment of the situation and asks the Vice-President and the President to appear in front of you and to respond as candidly as possible to the questions on the decision which has just been taken. I do not mean that we should be particularly proud, but that is transparency. I think I already responded to the question; we were open and when we met we discussed the situation without any prejudice. On the first point, I don't want to intrude into the decision-making process of the great country in which we are living. So I do not want to be interpreted in any respect in political terms. I will only mention that I had the great privilege to negotiate with Horst. He was the Staatssekretär for Germany, I was the Under-Secretary of the Treasury for France and we negotiated together the Maastricht Treaty. He is a friend and I have for him an immense appreciation, I mean an immense professional appreciation, and, well, that is what I wanted to say. As far as Italy is concerned, I have nothing to add to what we already said. You are referring to the previous discussion between the Banca d'Italia on the relationship with the Treasury? Is that right? There is nothing new in your question. Is it a new thing? If it is a new thing, I don't want to comment in any respect because we have to look at it. My comment would be that it is not true to say that rates are higher here than anywhere else. You just cross the Channel and you have interest rates which are twice as high as they are here. Interest rates in London are at 4%. They are 2% here and 2% is the lowest level practically since World War II. And in some countries it is a level which was unthinkable only a few years ago. So, we are in a situation where we have an environment which is certainly favourable to growth in financial terms, and as far as market interest rates are concerned every economy acts according to its own situation. We do that as far as we can; here and there are criticisms, I cannot deny that. Some criticisms implicitly go in the direction: you should be perhaps a little bit less orthodox, quote unquote. Others that have come recently, the CEPR, for instance, made very interesting analysis signed by four or – if I am not mistaken – five very brilliant academics and they say: well, this European Central Bank looks a little bit loose in its policy, they didn't deliver price stability, they should be more responsible. In my view really, both criticisms are not justified. I have the strong sentiment that we have done exactly what was appropriate in the circumstances where we were and I am convinced that it is being exactly as appropriate as we can be, that we can improve confidence as I said. It is very important to consider that it is not liquidity that is lacking in Europe today, it is not capital that is lacking in Europe today, it is not savings that are lacking in Europe today, and certainly not men and women of great quality. It is a little bit of confidence that is lacking and one of the ways we have to improve confidence is to say, well, there is an ECB, it is there, you can be sure that your purchasing power will be protected over time, not only today or tomorrow, but over time. Then you can adopt, perhaps I would say, a more positive attitude as regards consumption and investment. That being said, we are not alone, that being said, it is true that there are structural impediments to growth in Europe. We all agree on that. There is not a single element of difference between the executive branches and the ECB as regards the necessity of embarking on structural reforms. We all agree, we all would underwrite the Lisbon Agenda and, as I said, we welcome what has been decided in order to improve the situation in this respect. We back the governments that have embarked on those reforms and we try to help and to explain why it is good. I think that at the present juncture we are spending a lot of time. If I take into account all the reflections on this matter by the Governing Council, I would say that perhaps we are devoting right now in between a quarter or a third of our time to the enlargement issue, so as to gain a better understanding of the situation of each of these particular countries. The overall attitude is an attitude of pride because it is a fantastic historical event, an attitude of optimism because it is a major contribution to growth all over Europe to have – if I am not mistaken – around 75 million newcomers and ten new countries. The Governors have been invited to attend the General Council meetings. We invite the experts from the various national banks concerned to be present when we have ESCB committee meetings and we are trying to understand each case. Because we are also absolutely convinced that we have to analyse the situation case by case. There is not a single economy which resembles another economy. So a lot of time has to be spent to get into the specificities of these countries. But again, I would sum up by saying that we are proud, we are convinced, that it is good for Europe and we are convinced that this is a professional challenge of the first magnitude to be sure that we optimising their integration, including perhaps with appropriate professional preparation for ERM II, for instance, at the present juncture. We think there should not be any hurrying-up – that would be not be professionally justified. So we have to look again, on a case-by-case basis. But again, it is fantastic really to think that we will efficiently incorporate into the Europe Union ten new countries and 75 million newcomers, new fellow citizens. Everyone already knows what we think on this particular question. We have said here, in this very press conference, two months ago that excessive moves are not necessarily appropriate. So I will not say anything different than that. Everybody can observe what has happened and is happening since then and everybody knows what is our position here. When you look at the evolution after we spoke, you can see that, perhaps, the message has been somewhat incorporated in the behaviour of the market as something important. "
2004-02-05,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this press conference. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. On the basis of our economic and monetary analysis, we have concluded that there are no fundamental changes to the medium-term outlook for price stability. Accordingly, the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate and the key ECB interest rates have been kept unchanged at their low levels. Inflationary risks should be contained by somewhat more favourable import price developments, while the economic recovery in the euro area should proceed in line with our expectations. We will continue to monitor carefully all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. With regard to exchange rates, we again particularly stress stability and remain concerned about excessive exchange rate moves. Let me now explain our decision in more detail. Starting with the economic analysis, the latest data on euro area production as well as survey evidence on business confidence remain consistent with ongoing growth around the turn of the year. Looking ahead, the external environment of the euro area should continue to develop favourably. In particular, robust real GDP growth in our major trading partners’ economies can be expected to support foreign demand for euro area goods and services, while export growth may be dampened somewhat by the decline in price competitiveness. The conditions for an improvement in domestic demand are also favourable. Investment activity should not only profit from global trends in demand, but also from companies’ efforts to enhance productivity and profitability, from the low level of interest rates and from generally favourable financing conditions. Growth in private consumption, which has so far remained rather subdued, can also be expected to recover in line with an increase in real disposable income. This assessment is reflected in all available forecasts from official and private sources and seems to be confirmed by developments in financial markets. Looking at the risks to this outlook, there are no new factors to be taken into account. Over the shorter term, risks remain balanced. Over longer horizons, uncertainties relate to the persistent imbalances in some regions of the world and their potential repercussions on the sustainability of global economic growth. This calls for sustainable macroeconomic policies and structural reforms which foster a sound balance between savings and investment in all major partner countries, which enhance the production potential in the euro area and which support a further expansion in trade of goods and services at the global level. Turning to price developments, we have seen a fall in the HICP inflation rate for December to 2.0%. The same rate was estimated by Eurostat for January. In the course of this year, inflation rates should fall below 2% and remain in line with price stability thereafter. While US dollar-denominated global commodity prices have been on an upward trend over recent months, the past appreciation of the euro is dampening their effects on domestic prices. Moreover, we continue to expect wage developments to remain moderate in the context of high rates of unemployment and a gradual economic recovery. Recent data on labour costs seem to broadly confirm the assessment of a levelling-off of wage increases. On the whole, inflationary pressure remains limited – an assessment that is confirmed by all available forecasts. Given the conditional nature of any forward-looking evaluation, it is of course important to bear in mind all elements of risk to the outlook for price stability and to monitor inflation expectations closely. Turning to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth has continued to moderate slowly over recent months. This can be explained by the still cautious reallocation of portfolios by economic agents and the effects of generally low interest rates on the growth of very liquid assets. At the same time, the growth of loans to the private sector reflects the effects of both low interest rates and an improvement in the economic environment. The strong monetary growth over the past few years means that there is significantly more liquidity available in the euro area than needed to finance non-inflationary growth. Whether or not the accumulated excess liquidity will translate into inflationary pressures over the medium term depends on the extent to which past portfolios shifts are reversed and on the future strength of economic growth. Should excess liquidity persist, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. In summary, the economic analysis continues to indicate that the main scenario for price developments in the medium term is in line with price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis does not alter this picture. With regard to fiscal policies, there are several important issues that warrant close attention. First, the implementation of fiscal policies should be in line with the commitments made late last year. In this connection, a thorough assessment of the new Stability Programmes of Member States is currently under way. All parties involved need to live up to their responsibilities and commitments. Sound public finances support a stable macroeconomic framework, which in turn enhances confidence and promotes investment, growth and employment in the euro area. Second, as regards the Stability and Growth Pact, the Governing Council shares the concerns of the European Commission regarding the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council in November last year. The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and the ECB respects the Commission’s decision to seek legal clarity. Furthermore, we do not see a need to change the Treaty and, in our view, the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form is appropriate. We are in agreement with the Commission that the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact could be further improved, in particular in terms of the analysis of structural imbalances and the strengthening of incentives for sound fiscal policies during good economic times. Clarity and enforceability of the fiscal framework should be enhanced. A stable macroeconomic framework is necessary to enhance our growth potential, but it alone is not sufficient. Boosting employment, fostering labour productivity and making the best use of technological and scientific progress in the context of an ageing society all require structural reforms – in the fiscal domain as well as in financial, product and labour markets. The Lisbon Strategy provides the appropriate blueprint for progress. The responsibility for its implementation, however, lies with governments, parliaments and social partners. The Governing Council strongly supports ongoing efforts in a number of countries to proceed with structural reforms. At the same time, we fully share the view that additional, sustained efforts are required, as recently reiterated by the Commission in its progress report on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the priorities for 2004. It is a major challenge to convince the public at large that everybody would benefit – in terms of growth, more and better jobs, and higher incomes – if the reforms needed were indeed implemented. Finally, allow me to add a short remark regarding the publications of the ECB. As you may have noticed, the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin has been enhanced in a number of ways relating to its design, structure and general presentation. The in-depth coverage of all economic and monetary aspects relevant to monetary policy has of course been maintained, together with the statistical information. However, we believe that the report is now more accessible to the Press, financial market participants, policy-makers, and academics and students, as well as those members of the general public with an interest in European economic and monetary affairs. We are now at your disposal for questions. It is not my tradition to announce in advance anything as regards the G7 meeting. I will give you a “rendez-vous” after the meeting of the G7 in Florida. We will have the usual press encounter to explain the communiqué which we will discuss with friends from all over the world, including friends from the United States. Well, our judgement – as I just said – is that there has been an ongoing recovery since the third quarter of last year, which we have been observing very carefully. And, as I have said, all the signs that we have indicate that there is indeed an ongoing recovery. That being said, we are observing – and, as you have said, there have from time to time been signs – that it is an ongoing, relatively slow process of recovery. But we judge that all the elements that are available confirm that this recovery is proceeding. And I have to say also that this is not very original on our part because it is the global consensus. All international institutions judge that this ongoing recovery is proceeding. First of all, at each of our monthly meetings we look at the overall economic situation, we make a judgement, and the Vice-President and I have the privilege of bringing that sentiment to you in an open and transparent way. And I consider that this is indeed a demonstration of a total transparency. We have looked at the situation. Our judgement is that our monetary stance is correct. At each of these meetings we look at whether we have to increase rates, decrease rates or leave rates unchanged, and I have no other comment on that. This is by definition what we do at each of our monthly meetings. As regards Japan, I have no particular comment on the policy pursued. I will discuss this with colleagues in the G7 in a very short time from now. Over several meetings of the Governing Council, we have said that we thought the conditions were there for a pick-up in domestic demand – conditions from the investment side of the coin. And from that standpoint, it seems to me that we have a number of indicators which are encouraging. Of course, the confidence of entrepreneurs, which is materialising progressively, the favourable financial environment, and all the efforts made by firms to re-shape and increase their own resilience and profitability certainly go in the right direction. And this is the substantiation of this judgement of the conditions. As regards households, it is clear – and this is something that we said constantly during our recent press conferences – that the level of confidence in the household sector is very important. The disposable income is there. The fact is that we still have to improve confidence. And it is also part of our own contribution to the prosperity of Europe that we reassure households by telling them that, as regards our own responsibilities, we are doing all we can to help them have confidence in their overall purchasing power, that we are there to ensure that they will have stable prices and monetary stability. And we believe that all we can do to communicate this element of confidence to the households is very important. Part of the confidence of households should normally be that governments, parliaments and social partners are tackling structural reforms. It is important for us to perhaps take advantage of this press conference to say that households in Europe should not be frightened by the fact that we are tackling necessary structural reforms. On the contrary, they should be encouraged because the fact that the problems existing here and there are being coped with is reassuring; if we did not cope with them it would not be reassuring at all. This is the reason why we back the structural reforms and we tell the public that every citizen of Europe is better off when we proceed in this direction. The right message is the message that I delivered just a moment ago. I have no other comment on that. I will not comment on any remark made by any member of the Commission, including Mr Solbes. I will only say that our position is that the Treaty should not be changed. This is the position of the Governing Council of the ECB. We believe that the secondary legislation, namely the Stability and Growth Pact itself, the wording of the Pact, should not be changed. The implementation of that secondary legislation and of that Treaty could be improved, along the lines that have been suggested by the Commission and especially by Commissioner Solbes, taking account, in particular, but not only, of the fact that structural analyses complementing nominal analyses are very useful. The issue of what to do in affluent times is also something which is of importance. And you have a number of other improvements that could certainly be made and that would be welcome. It is not that I cannot comment. We have not had the meeting yet. Our position is very clear. I have on many occasions explained how we see our own situation, how we see the global economy and so forth. And I have also said that we all have homework to do. We have structural reforms to implement and we know that all other partners, of course, also have homework to do. I will comment after the meeting, not before the meeting. Any disadvantages that are associated with the current exchange rate? I would not wish to comment further. I have been very, very clear on our position and I will let you meditate on the sentence concerned, which presents our position in compact form. We have also said very clearly that our long-term strategy remains unchanged. I can add that a long-term strategy is extraordinarily important for inspiring confidence in the currency and for anchoring long-term inflation expectations. This makes possible what we have today – a fantastic asset of the European economy – namely a financial environment which is very favourable, with medium and long-term interest rates that are very favourable and – I would say – are “crystallising” the performance of the best legacy currencies prior to the euro. This is a prouesse [amazing achievement] on the part of the euro, because, as I have already said, the markets and global observers did not believe in 1997 and 1998 that we could deliver a new currency that would be as credible as the best legacy currencies. Question (translated from French): Are you satisfied with having succeeded in holding back the continued rise of the euro in the last month? Second question, with regard to the exchange rates, you said that all partners have efforts to make, do you feel you have made the necessary efforts, and who needs to make efforts? Trichet (translated from French): I will not give an answer to the first question, I do not comment. The markets and the operators, the investors, and all partners, they have to make their own judgement based on what the Governing Council of the European Central Bank has said. And I leave it up to them to comment and to draw their own conclusions. With regard to the second point, I said it already, we all have, of course, work to do to improve the situation. Each and every one on their own side, we all have homework to do. We do not lecture anybody, we have work to do and we know that others have work to do as well. Question (translated from French): I do not want to quote in German what Ernst Welteke said on Tuesday night, but he said that the strong Deutsche Mark had helped Germany a lot. Do you think that the strong euro also helps the euro area? A second point, you have referred to scientific progress, which you support in the framework of the Lisbon strategy. Do you think that the member countries, especially France and Germany, are doing enough in the field of research at the moment. Trichet (translated from French): I think you already got an answer to the first question: the long-term strategy allows a maximum of confidence, allows an advantageous financial environment and this works in favour of growth and job creation through the level of medium- and long-term market interest rates. With regard to your second question, I would say simply that we think, generally speaking, that the diagnosis of Lisbon is a good diagnosis, it lays great emphasis on the efforts that have to be made to create, by 2010, the best society in terms of the economy, in terms of knowledge. Scientific research and development is fundamental and so we encourage all efforts made in this field. No, we did not. No, frankly speaking, it is for you to judge. I mentioned what our position was. I would say that it was no more, no less, than before. We will have a nice occasion to discuss that directly with our Japanese friends within a few hours. Thank you. In any case, as you know, the Treaty involves us very profoundly because we have to give our advice. And we are called into the decision-making process as well as the European Parliament. So, we are necessarily involved in the decision. That being said, as you know, after being called upon to give our advice, the ultimate decision is taken by the Council itself. We are observing what has been said here and there and we will continue, of course, to follow that important question very carefully. "
2004-01-08,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first press conference of 2004. Let me express the Vice-President’s and my own best wishes to you all for the New Year. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council, Mr McCreevy, and Commissioner Solbes. Following our regular economic and monetary analysis, we continue to judge the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate to preserve price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their low levels. The available indicators point to an ongoing economic recovery in the euro area. This assessment has not fundamentally changed. Although recent exchange rate developments are likely to have some dampening effects on exports, export growth should continue to benefit from the dynamic expansion of the world economy. Import price developments in the euro area should become somewhat more favourable, thereby helping to contain inflationary risks. We will continue to carefully monitor all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. Let me now explain our decision in more detail. Starting with the economic analysis, recently available indicators confirm that world economic growth is progressing. For the euro area too, the latest information on production and confidence is consistent with an ongoing recovery in economic activity, and the momentum for growth should strengthen in the course of 2004. This assessment is supported by all available forecasts from official and private sources, as well as by developments in the financial markets. On the external side, recent exchange rate developments are having a negative impact on the price competitiveness of euro area exporters, but thus far this should be partly compensated for by the ongoing expansion of global demand. Overall, euro area exports should therefore continue to grow. On the domestic side, investment growth should benefit from the ongoing adjustment efforts of firms to enhance productivity and profitability, as well as from the low level of interest rates and generally favourable financing conditions. Private consumption should receive support from real disposable income growth, partly due to favourable effects on terms of trade and inflation stemming from the past appreciation of the euro. The short-term risks to this outlook remain balanced. Over longer horizons, the uncertainties continue to be related to persistent external imbalances in some regions of the world and their potential repercussions on the sustainability of global economic growth. This is a challenge to be addressed by sustainable macroeconomic policies and structural reforms which foster a sound balance between savings and investment in all major partner countries, enhance the production potential in the euro area and support a further expansion in trade of goods and services at the global level. With regard to price developments, HICP inflation rates over the short term are still expected to fluctuate around the 2% level, following a rate of 2.1% in December, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. As I have explained on previous occasions, adverse food price developments, the evolution of oil prices and increases in indirect taxes and administered prices have all adversely affected the short-term outlook for inflation. However, in the course of this year we expect inflation rates to fall and to remain in line with price stability thereafter. This expectation is based on the assumption that wage developments will remain moderate in the context of a gradual economic recovery. Moreover, the past appreciation of the euro should dampen price pressures. These views are also reflected in the available forecasts and projections. We are, of course, fully aware of the conditional nature of these forward-looking exercises and therefore bear in mind all elements of risk to the outlook for price stability. In the same vein, we continue to closely monitor inflation expectations. Turning to the monetary analysis, the strong monetary growth of the last few years means that there is significantly more liquidity available in the euro area than needed to finance non-inflationary growth. At the same time, the growth of loans to the private sector has been rising over recent months, benefiting from the low level of interest rates and the general improvement in the economic environment. In our view, the accumulation of excess liquidity should not be of concern for price stability as long as the economic recovery is gradual. However, should excess liquidity remain high once there is a significant strengthening of economic activity, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. We will therefore carefully examine monetary developments as they unfold. In summary, the economic analysis continues to indicate that the main scenario for price developments in the medium term is in line with price stability. This picture is confirmed by cross-checking with the monetary analysis. Concerning fiscal policies, 2004 will be a crucial year for strengthening the credibility of the institutional framework and confidence in the soundness of public finances of Member States across the euro area. Together with the Treaty provisions, the overall fiscal framework of the Stability and Growth Pact remains of central importance and must be fully respected. These are the foundations for trust and confidence in EMU. They are key not only to stability but also to growth, and are a precondition for preserving low risk premia in financial markets. We therefore strongly urge governments and the ECOFIN Council to live up to their responsibilities and to the commitments they made last November. Finally, the Governing Council strongly supports ongoing efforts by a number of governments to proceed with structural reforms – in the fiscal domain, and in labour and product markets. Building on what has already been implemented, further reforms are required to make the euro area economy more flexible, to allow a better allocation and utilisation of capital and human resources, and to enhance the euro area’s growth potential. The process of structural reform would be greatly enhanced if social partners were to fully commit themselves to the objective of making the euro area a more dynamic, innovative and competitive economy. Such common efforts should help to better communicate to the public the benefits of effectively responding to the main challenges of the euro area: bringing down the high level of structural unemployment, enhancing the production potential, increasing productivity, reducing the inefficiencies of the tax system as well as preparing the health and pension systems for the ageing of the population. We are now at your disposal for questions. To reply to your first question: as you know, Commissioner Solbes was with us and we were informed of his views and of the procedure which takes place in Brussels, inside the Commission. We took note of what we were told. And, at this stage, we consider that each institution has its own responsibility to bear. We have no position on what has been envisaged in this respect. We consider it a very important matter, a very important question, and of course, we will continue to meditate – if I may put it like that – but it is not our own responsibility. And we took note of what we were told. We have no particular message for the Irish Presidency. But the President of the Eurogroup and of the ECOFIN was here, as I have said. He expounded his own views and I will only refer, if you permit, to our own position, which is that the Stability and Growth Pact exists. The letter and the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact exist. We already said that. This is not, if I may say, a scoop. We consider that there have been commitments which were made in the decision – which was taken by the Council, commitments by two countries, commitments by the Council itself (by the qualified majority of the Council), namely that if these commitments were not met then the procedure envisaged in the Stability and Growth Pact would be implemented. We already said that. And I can reiterate that today of course. It is a position which is very well known by everybody, including the Irish Presidency. As you know, we have a concept of monetary policy which has been explained, clarified recently, which undergoes an economic analysis, and then a cross-checking – as I just mentioned – with the monetary analysis. And our monetary decisions are based upon this overall implementation of our monetary policy concept. In our economic analysis, we introduce all elements, all factors, that have a bearing on the situation, and – as I said several times on behalf of the Governing Council – we are not the prisoner of an equation, we are not the prisoner of a system of equations, we are not the prisoner of an algorithm which would dictate our conduct and behaviour. We take, I would say, all pertinent information – all pertinent analyses – and we make a judgement. And, of course, exchange markets and movements in the exchange markets are part of the input into our overall analysis, which is entirely devoted to ensuring price stability – as we have been given that mandate by the Treaty and as it is very, very important, as I have always said, for growth. Because by anchoring a low level of inflation in the years to come, and not in the medium term but also in the long term, we pave the way for this favourable financial environment which is conducive to growth. So, exchange markets come into our analysis as part of the input which needs to be examined when we devise our own position. As I said, we have an impact of exchange markets in our analysis, I mentioned this on behalf of the Governing Council several times in my introductory statement, and it is part of a much more complex set of inputs. I will only say that, like all central banks, we have a stake in financial stability. By this I mean stability in general, and it is clear that we do not particularly like excessive volatility or excessive turbulence. Well, I shall let you judge whether I am addressing recent events or less recent events when I say that we do not like excessive volatility on the exchange markets. As I have said, we have a stake in financial stability and in stability in general and we have no particular preference for excessive volatility or excessive turbulence. I have no memory of having commented in that way the Dubai communiqué. Question (Translation): Your predecessor said “The euro is me, I am Mr Euro.” Hence your refusal to give us an indication of the exchange rate policy is rather surprising, because in spite of everything, the Maastricht Treaty does say that you can make proposals and you can indicate a position. So the question still needs to be asked: are you satisfied with the present level of the euro and the current dynamics of the euro? My second question is a more practical one. At present, opinion polls show that there is a growing mistrust in the euro. In France this morning’s Nouvel Observateur states that 56% of the French population think that the euro is bad and that it has had inflationary pressures, and the same is true in many countries in southern Europe, for example in Greece or Italy. Is that not worrying, because any mistrust in the currency does not really inspire confidence? Trichet (Translation): As a central bank, as the European Central Bank, we, of course, are concerned about ensuring that there is both financial stability and stability on the markets in general. So we were not particularly satisfied with what I called the excessive volatility or excessive turbulence or excessive shifts in general. And I can only reiterate that. Now, as to your question on confidence, I think that the issue of confidence is an extremely important one. Take, for example, the situation in the euro area, where we have a very favourable financial environment, with short-term rates at zero in real terms and extremely low long-term rates. This was the case in much of Europe, and has now been attained throughout the euro area. If I also look at the level of savings and at the availability of capital, it is quite clear that there are many factors which should create a new dynamism in Europe, which would be very satisfying. But as for confidence, I think that that is one of the most significant problems that we are facing and we therefore feel that we should do everything in our power to increase confidence. (In English) I have already mentioned the fact that we do not like excessive volatility and turbulence in general and that we had a stake in stability and stability in the exchange market as well as financial stability in general. As regards confidence, I was saying a moment ago that it is extremely important to consider the overall environment in the euro area. We have a low level of interest rates, short-term rates are at zero in real terms, long-term rates are at the very low level, which had been achieved in the past by only a part of the European Union but are now generalised throughout the euro area. We have savings, we have capital and therefore we have many of the conditions required for a pick-up. Perhaps we need a little more confidence. The reason why I pick up on the word “confidence”, which was in the question, is to say how important it is that we all contribute to confidence and that we should try to do what we can to improve confidence. I think that confidence is really crystallised, in a way, in terms of the low level of medium and long-term market interest rates, which again is part of the overall environment in the euro area. Question (translation): Does the ECB have any calculations as to the proportion of euro area exports going to external countries actually affected by this appreciation of the euro? Today in Berlin … someone from the Commission mentioned a figure of 10%. I can’t understand that. What figure would you put on it? And the second question is: for some days there has been speculation that the central banks, presumably because of the weakness of the dollar, will record considerable losses on their 2003 balance sheets. Can you please tell us what the European Central Bank’s situation will be and comment on the speculation? Thank you. Thank you very much, Madame. Perhaps, I could respond to the first question and ship the second to Lucas, if he wants it. The second, would you? Papademos: Yes, the strengthening of the euro, or the depreciation of the dollar, in 2003 had an impact on the financial results of the ECB. In general, the ECB’s profitability is subject to considerable fluctuations due to large exchange-rate and interest-rate exposures arising from the structure of its balance sheet. You all know that the bulk of the foreign reserves of the ECB is held in US dollars. So the strengthening of the euro implies that the euro value of the ECB’s holdings of US dollar-denominated assets declined, and this resulted in unrealised losses. We pursue an accounting policy based on the principle of prudence and therefore we treat unrealised losses as realised losses. I should also say that the low interest rates, which prevailed in the year 2003 and their evolution both on the foreign reserves of the ECB as well as on the euro assets also adversely influenced the ECB’s interest income. We have estimated that the financial accounts of the ECB, which will be published towards the end of March, will show a loss of the order of half a billion euro. I should mention, however, that the ECB has substantial buffers to cover this loss. Papademos: No, it will not be necessary. Thank you very much. You had a first question, and I will only say that we of course examined very thoroughly, as I have said, the impact – in our view and in the view of a number of analyses – of the moves in exchange rates on exports. And we took into account the fact that, on the one hand, you have a confirmation of the dynamism of global growth: all the information we have had since our last meeting, for instance, is going in the direction of more dynamic global growth and global demand for our exports. And on the other hand, we had some dampening effect, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council. Taking all this into account, our judgement was that the overall situation, from our standpoint, had not substantially changed, and that explains why we made the diagnosis that we had to keep rates unchanged. I have referred several times to the fact that all central banks in the world are pursuing sound and reasonable policies and that I was myself rejoicing that they are pursuing those policies which we are pursuing, which our friends and partners across the Atlantic are pursuing and which others are pursuing. And I believe that this set of sound and reasonable policies is one of the necessary conditions for markets and exchange rates to be stable. That is my position. As I have said, every month we look at the overall situation. We consider all factors. As we have said, exchange markets are one of the factors that we examine, alongside numerous other factors. And we take our decisions on the basis of all of those factors. First of all, as regards the second part of your question, I would say that we had a general discussion. On behalf of the Governing Council I read out the introductory statement and this is our diagnosis, which we have worded to the comma and to the adjective. And I am responding to questions now on behalf of the Governing Council, together with the Vice-President. On the first question, we mentioned once or twice that the fact that there have been changes in the exchange market has a positive effect from the point of view of inflation. It has been mentioned several times and it is obvious that we are as a result importing a little bit of disinflation. That is clear. Overall, having taken into account all the elements of the situation – and they are very numerous, as I have said – and all pertinent analyses, our conclusion was, as I have said, that we had sticky inflation, we had inertia in inflation, which could perhaps persist for some months, and that we would then see inflation clearly coming down in line with our definition of price stability. And this diagnosis has not changed since last month. Well, first of all, it is extremely important that we come to this question because we all know, of course, that a historic change is on its way within a matter of weeks. As you know, we have in a way anticipated this a little bit because the national central banks of those ten countries are already involved in the ESCB committees. The Governors are already around the table in the General Council meetings, even if it is with observer status. And, of course, the next step, entry into the European Union, is something, which is again historically extraordinarily inspiring, extraordinarily important. Not only at the European level, but also at the global level. That being said, we will see. I would not like to comment further on their entry into the ERM and then afterwards perhaps the euro. You know that we have published a long paper which crystallises the position of the Governing Council of the ECB on that matter. I do not want to elaborate more on that. Everybody knows our position. We think that it is a very important point. Entering the euro is extremely important, and it needs to be examined very carefully. Convergence must be not only nominal, but also real, as is required by the Treaty. “Real” means sustainable in the long run, and “the long run” means eternity as regards participation in the euro. So there is an enormous amount at stake for the country concerned and for the whole of the Eurosystem, so we must ensure that absolutely no mistake is made, because a mistake would be contrary to the interests of that country, that particular economy, and also totally contrary to the interests of the Eurosystem itself. So it is a very serious, very important question that will be examined on the basis of the Treaty, applying, of course, exactly the same rules that applied to the present members of the euro area. You know that we – both in this respect and in relation to the previous question – we, the Eurosystem has a position on supervision, which was published some time ago. We think that it is appropriate for central banks to be in charge of, or very, very closely associated with, banking supervision. If I may say so, conceptually we are very close to the US in this respect. As you know, the US considers it important that the Federal Reserve should have a very important role here. We are also based upon a decentralised concept. And, as you know, the European concept is a decentralised concept whereby the national authorities have their responsibility and we have ourselves a particular mandate to pave the way for the best possible functioning of that system. And I will stick to this position of the Governing Council, which has also been expressed publicly. Well, we did not discuss in detail the preparation of the G7 meeting. In the G7, G3/G7, there will be the President of the Eurogroup and he will himself, I trust, examine the situation within the format of the Eurogroup, as it is necessary, of course. But I leave this responsibility with him. We have our own responsibility in the European concept, as you know. And Wim was particularly right in that domain, as in all domains, to say that the ECB has important – very important – responsibilities in this respect. And I draw your attention to the fact that in any case when we produce a G7 communiqué, because you mentioned G7, it is signed by ministers and central bank governors. I have no other comment on that. But we ourselves have very, very important responsibilities. That is absolutely clear. "
