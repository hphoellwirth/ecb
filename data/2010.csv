Date,President,Text
02/12/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council confirmed that the current key ECB interest rates are appropriate. It therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 4 November 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of the recovery, while uncertainty is elevated. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations are firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. The Governing Council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (MROs) and the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the third maintenance period of 2011 on 12 April 2011. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted on 26 January, 23 February and 30 March 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP grew by 0.4% on a quarterly basis in the third quarter of 2010, following exceptional growth of 1.0% in the second quarter. Recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence generally confirm that the positive underlying momentum of the economic recovery in the euro area remains in place. In line with previous expectations, this implies ongoing real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of this year. Euro area exports should further benefit from a continued recovery in the world economy. At the same time, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real GDP growth will range between 1.6% and 1.8% in 2010, between 0.7% and 2.1%% in 2011 and between 0.6% and 2.8% in 2012. Compared with the September 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the range for 2010 has narrowed somewhat and shifted towards the upper end of September’s range, while the range for 2011 is slightly narrower. The December 2010 Eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are tilted to the downside, with uncertainty remaining elevated. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. At the same time, it is to be noted that the level of business confidence in the euro area remains relatively high. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in November, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from October. In the next few months HICP inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year. Overall, in the period ahead inflation rates should remain moderate. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% for 2010, between 1.3% and 2.3% for 2011 and between 0.7% and 2.3% for 2012. Compared with the ECB staff projections published in September, the range for 2010 is unchanged, while the range for 2011 is marginally higher. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. Upside risks relate, in particular, to developments in energy and non-energy commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are still expected to be contained. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 remained broadly unchanged at 1.0% in October, after 1.1% in September 2010. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased to 1.4% in October from 1.2% in the previous month. Broad money and loan growth hence remained low, supporting the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. The steepness of the yield curve has continued to lessen somewhat, implying a gradual softening of the dampening impact on M3 that was associated with shifts of funds from monetary assets to longer-term financial assets outside M3. The interest rate constellation also includes a further widening in the spread between interest rates paid on short-term time deposits and those paid on overnight deposits. As a result, annual M1 growth has continued to moderate, standing at 4.9% in October 2010, after 6.2% in September, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits continues to become less negative. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal positive growth in loans to households, with 2.9% in October after 2.8% in September, and still negative growth in loans to non-financial corporations, which stood at -0.6% in October, unchanged from September. When correcting for the impact of derecognition of loans from bank balance sheets, the growth in loans to non-financial corporations continued to strengthen, further confirming that a turning point was reached earlier in 2010. Over the past few months, banks have generally stabilised the size of their balance sheets while expanding the provision of credit to the private sector. However, the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. We therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 4 November 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of the recovery, while uncertainty is elevated. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations are firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, while budgetary developments for some euro area countries are more favourable than expected, concerns about unsustainable fiscal positions and their vulnerability to adverse market reactions remain very high for others and have had repercussions throughout the euro area. In this environment, there is a clear need for the responsible authorities to strengthen confidence in sound public finances, thereby reducing risk premia in interest rates and supporting sustainable growth over the medium term. At the same time, all euro area countries should pursue ambitious and credible multi-year consolidation strategies and implement fully the planned corrective measures, focusing on the expenditure side. In their 2011 budgets, countries need to specify the necessary fiscal adjustment measures in detail, while standing ready to correct any slippages from the fiscal objectives announced. Substantial and far-reaching structural reforms should be rapidly implemented to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. Major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. The removal of labour market rigidities would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies. Such measures are crucial for enhancing productivity growth, one of the main drivers of long-term growth. All these structural reforms should be supported by an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models remain key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. Finally, let me recall that the Governing Council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was agreed by the Irish government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund. The programme contains the necessary elements to bring about a sustainable stabilisation of the Irish economy. It addresses in a decisive manner the economic and financial causes underlying current market concerns and will thereby contribute to restoring confidence and safeguarding financial stability in the euro area. The Governing Council welcomes the commitment of the Irish public authorities to take any further measures that may become appropriate to achieve the objectives of the programme. We are now at your disposal for questions. Secondly, on bond purchases, can you tell us a bit more about the recent ECB activities on the bond purchase programme, also vis-à-vis some market demands about sterilisation or not sterilisation? Are you still fully sterilising whatever you do, whatever you buy in the bond markets? Your questions cover a wide range of issues that are important. I see five points in what I have said that are particularly worth noting in responding to your questions. First, for our monetary policy stance we consider the present interest rates to be appropriate to deliver price stability in the medium run. The second point, which is very important, is that our non-standard measures are there to permit the appropriate transmission of the standard measures, of the monetary policy stance, which I just said was appropriate. Third, we have decided to maintain full allotment for the first quarter of next year. Not only for the MRO – as I explained in the introductory remarks – not only for the one-month refinancing operation, but also the three-months allotment. Our judgement is that it is appropriate to pursue this non-standard mode of procedure, taking into account the transmission of monetary policy. A fourth point is that the Governing Council considers that, as I said two days ago, the SMP (Securities Markets Programme) is ongoing. I repeat: the SMP programme is ongoing. I will not comment on the observation of market participants. We will continue to withdraw the liquidity that we are injecting through the SMP programme, as we decided from the start. And you know pretty well the tool that we utilise to that end. Lastly, we will continue to be permanently alert, and to be sure that we have the right monetary policy stance. Our credibility rests on the fact that we deliver price stability, in line with our mandate. It is the Treaty mandate. We delivered 1.97% yearly inflation over the first twelve years of the single currency. You will tell me that I repeat that, but I think it is very important. By the way, I said this to the Members of the European Parliament in Brussels two days ago, and I could see the extent to which, as representatives of the European people, they appreciate the fact that we delivered our primary mandate over the first twelve years. We even had applause. I was quite moved. And secondly, was there unanimity in delaying the exit strategy? If not, can you give us an indication as to what other options were debated, and did you also discuss ramping up the bond purchases? On the first point, our actions have to correspond to what we observe in the functioning of the various transmission channels for our monetary policy. We always act in line with what we observe in terms of market disruption and/or absence of normal functioning. Our working assumption is that we will return to normal functioning. When we are functioning normally, we interrupt all non-standard measures by construction, by definition. They are temporary precisely because they correspond to the absence of normal functioning in some markets or market segments. To reiterate: they are temporary in nature. As regards the decision we have taken, we have a consensus for the decision on the three-months, and we have an overwhelming majority as regards the SMP. And what counts, of course, is the college, the Governing Council. This is the entity that is responsible for delivering price stability to the fellow citizens of Europe – as we have done, and will continue to do. It goes without saying that it was the decision of the government of Ireland. And that all those involved in discussions with the government of Ireland concluded that it was necessary to engage in this adjustment programme. This includes the IMF, the Commission – in liaison with us – and also those of the European governments, namely the Eurogroup, that have decided to support these necessary efforts. And secondly, you say that the SMP will be calibrated according to your perceptions of the degree of disruption in the markets – could you give us some flavour of how you assess the level of disruption in the markets at the moment, considering the apparent high risk of default seen for countries, even countries such as Spain, perceived by financial markets? Would you not say that at the moment the levels of disruption in financial markets are pretty high? I repeat what I just said about the SMP, which is ongoing and which is observed closely by the markets: it is designed to permit the best possible transmission of our monetary policy under the present circumstances. And that is the perspective from which we view not only the SMP, but all our non-standard measures. It is also for that reason that we have decided, in particular, to maintain the full allotment fixed rate for the three months window for refinancing. I have no further comment. And I repeat: we are constantly alert. We are constantly looking at the situation of the markets and at the acute tensions that I mentioned in the introductory remarks. We continue to apply our doctrine, which is to separate standard and non-standard measures. The non-standard measures are there to permit the appropriate transmission of the standard measures. I already mentioned the decisive importance of the decisions taken by the executive branches, by the governments, in the present circumstances. Again, we ourselves have a mandate, and the mandate is clear. We provided the benchmark ex ante, before the start of the euro. We have delivered exactly as we said we would deliver. Everybody can judge that, and we have, according to observers and markets, the credibility to deliver the same level of price stability in the years to come. We observe tensions and we have to take these into account to ensure that we continue to deliver price stability to our fellow citizens. And we expect the executive branches, the governments, to do what we trust they have to do, according to the Treaty. My second question is related to the disclosure yesterday of Federal Reserve data on zero interest rate loans given to banks in the United States, which is creating some backlash, especially because of the long list of European banks which used Federal Reserve money. The author of the Disclosure Bill, Senator Sanders, who is an independent and has been re-elected, said yesterday in a press conference that Congress will now monitor Federal Reserve loans abroad much more closely, adding that this will give Congress more authority to push for a reintroduction of bank separation, i.e. the famous Glass-Steagall Act. I am not going to ask you my regular question on this because I know what your opinion is. My question is: how will this affect Europe? First, I have no particular comment on the declaration of the President of Iceland, as I haven’t read it and I do not usually comment on declarations that I have not read. The plan for Ireland, which, again, we considered to be a good one, was discussed thoroughly by the IMF, the European Commission in liaison with us. On your second question, I would only say that those European banks that are on the list pursue business activities in the United States within the framework of the global financial system. We are all interconnected. In my opinion, it is extremely important that we continue to have an interconnected global financial system, but with a level playing field and fair treatment, refraining from protectionism in the various market places. We need fair and open treatment, with the same rules being applied to all those who are participating. And I think this is what we are doing at the global level. I fully trust all other partners – not only the United States and the Federal Reserve, but also all other partners in the world, including the emerging world. From the very beginning, the aim of the programme has been to help us restore the functioning of our monetary policy transmission mechanism, and it is for the Governing Council to judge how best to do this. It is not quantitative easing; we are withdrawing all the liquidity that we are injecting. As I said in the introductory remarks, we examined the whole situation. I also mentioned that there were tensions. It is of course a general observation, which explains why, in particular, we decided to maintain the full allotment for the one-week, one-month and three-month supplies of liquidity. And my second question: you said that you expect governments to do what they should. Do you think that the euro zone governments have the capacity to respond to this crisis? On your first question I would say you know what we publish every week. So I would ask you to look at that. On the second question, we all expect governments to do what they have committed themselves to do. They all have their own medium-term adjustment and stabilisation programmes. We expect very strongly that they will improve governance in the euro area. And I should not have to tell you again how attached we were to the idea of implementing the Stability and Growth Pact strictly, fighting – as we did in 2004 and 2005 – for the Pact to be preserved, and not to be weakened. And to be clear, I have to say we defended the Pact in a fierce opposition to the Governments of the big countries in Europe, because they wanted to weaken the Pact at the time. We expressed our grave concerns in 2005 and we are on record for that. More recently, we have been calling for quasi-automaticity, reinforcing sanctions very substantially. I have been asking for a “quantum leap” on behalf of the Governing Council, in order for both the Stability and Growth Pact itself, which monitors fiscal policies, and for macro policy surveillance, the surveillance of competitive indicators, the surveillance of imbalances to be given a legal basis and to be as strong as possible. I believe confidence is always regained progressively, so it is up to the responsible authorities, and I am sure that they will act to redress the situation progressively. I have never personally seen very sharp and abrupt changes in the attitude of investors and savers. They have to be convinced progressively. I am confident that the authorities in charge will progressively convince observers, savers and market participants. I was quite clear in telling you a moment ago that we judged that it was appropriate today to maintain the full allotment at a fixed rate, which we had envisaged changing. We had envisaged that we could return to tenders. This is a matter of judgement. It means that we do not exactly judge the situation in the way that we would have done if we had gone back to those tenders. I also have a technical question on the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Ireland. There has been an increase in other assets, which could mean some kind of emergency lending. Are national central banks able to make emergency loans available outside the normal ECB financing operations? Is this something that the ECB discusses or votes on? On your second point, we have a doctrine covering the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) and I have nothing to add to it, this is a standing concept. As regards your first question, it is true that we consider that the risks are broadly balanced when we look at the medium-term risks to price stability. They are broadly balanced overall, taking into account all the risks on the upside and all the risks on the downside, and also taking into account, as you have perhaps seen that we consider the risks for the real economy to be slightly on the downside. That is something we have had to take into consideration. I say that, but for me your question is interesting because I also have to say, as you could see today, that since the start of the recovery, which began in the third quarter of last year, we have been constantly surprised on the upside by what we have been observing. So we have revised our projections upwards, and the results, when they have come in, have been a little better or substantially better than what we were expecting and what international institutions were expecting. I mention that because from time to time observers are perhaps losing the sense of what is going on in the real economy. In the real economy, things are constantly proceeding. Today, as I have said, the staff narrowed the ranges of the projections. We also forecast that growth in 2010 would be 0.1 percentage point higher than we thought three months ago. It’s not much, but nevertheless, it’s been a constant factor since the third quarter of last year: increases in the real growth for 2010 in the new projections by comparison with the previous projections. This is no time for complacency, and I would not say that we are fully satisfied as regards the real economy. But nevertheless, I think it is something which is interesting to note and I would say that not all advanced economies are surprising on the upside when you look at the real economy. Today I have said a number of things and I do not want to repeat the five points that I made in responding to one of the first questions. I think that every observer can see what we have decided, what our intentions are, what mode we are in, and how alert we are. I think that this indicates as clearly as possible the Governing Council’s position. We will remain permanently alert and that is something that has always been part of our doctrine: credible alertness, as I call it, which means credible alertness as regards standard measures and credible alertness as regards non-standard measures. I never comment on market behaviour in real time. Everybody knows that in the market some hold long positions and others hold short positions, and that is the way the market functions. I am not speaking of the markets on a real-time, day-to-day basis. Instead, let us look at the situation on a longer-term basis. All the countries in Europe, without exception, are pursuing fiscal stabilisation programmes and adjustment programmes. On a consolidated basis, this year and next year the euro area is in much better shape than the other big advanced economies as regards public finance deficits. That might surprise some observers – perhaps it is not exactly the way they see it. But let me give you the figures: this year the consolidated fiscal deficit in the euro area is 6.3% of GDP. According to present estimates, it is 11.3% in the United States and 9.6% in Japan. Next year – and we call upon all governments to honour their commitments – the consolidated public finance deficit of the euro area is estimated to be 4.6% as a proportion of GDP. For the United States the figure is 8.9%, and for Japan it is 8.9%. And I could cite other big advanced economies that are in this category. So this is worthy of note. And I have already said that the real economy in Europe has so far – and I was able to confirm that today – delivered more surprises on the upside than on the downside, which is not the case for all economies. The latest data from the Purchasing Managers’ Index are quite encouraging, and the German citizens in this room are aware of the results of the latest Ifo Institute survey, which are the best recorded since reunification. These elements must also be incorporated in the assessments of observers, investors and savers. I will certainly not comment on that. But those of you who are the most lucid will probably see that you would be wise to take everything into account when making your own judgements, including the information I have just given, which is a little bit of an underestimation in my opinion. And you should also take into account the determination of European authorities and governments to preserve Europe and euro area stability. And second, what effect has the Fed’s quantitative easing had so far on Europe and the euro? On the second point I will not comment. On the first point I would say that, we have projections for each particular economy. The fact that we have a large proportion of the euro area that is now on its way to growing in a significant fashion, after having been very flat in terms of growth over the last years, is something which is offsetting the fact that other economies have to adjust after having grown rapidly. As you have seen, our projections are suggesting that we are going to have significant growth over the coming years. So taking all this into account, there is the offsetting that I have mentioned, which is the same phenomenon as that which we observed during the first years of the euro. I have indicated that we consider the decisions we took to be commensurate with the situation as regards the non-standard measures. I have no particular comment on any particular commercial bank. We apply our own supply of liquidity channels. We had no pre-disposition… Question :  But you said you “envisaged” that you could return… It was a possibility. We had a possibility of either going back to the normal tenders or maintaining these non-standard measures, which is to have the full allotment. We had no pre-disposition. And so we decided the way we did. But we were not pre-committed to any of the two options. We had two possibilities — they were obviously open — and we decided, as you know now, to maintain this full allotment fixed interest rate. I would say that, for all countries, it is extremely important to substantiate the decisions that would allow the goals for fiscal deficit next year, i.e. 2011, to be attained, also taking into account what is going on this year, of course. But I am concentrating on next year. This is the very, very firm message that we have for all countries, including Portugal. We are in liaison with the Commission and with the various administrations on that mode. Of course, I would certainly say that what you have mentioned as regards the Bank of Portugal’s position is a very important message, fully in line with the message that we have for all countries. My second question focuses on Germany. One of a number of recent surveys found that 47% of Germans want their Deutschmark back. How worried are you by this? And why do you think so many Germans are against the euro? Well, there are German citizens in this room. They can say that the euro has given the 330 million citizens of the euro area, including their compatriots, price stability, with inflation standing at 1.97%. Nobody ever challenges this when I say it. In Germany, the figure is even better. For Germany, inflation has stood at around 1.5% since the inception of the euro, the best result for Germany and indeed the euro area as a whole in 50 years. Frankly, for an institution that was called on by the citizens of Europe to have a primary mandate of delivering price stability, I think this is worth repeating. Let me tell you that I never comment on surveys with questions on going back to this or that currency. Of course, it is, in my opinion, totally, totally out of the question. And I trust that if you were to ask a question which would try to check whether it is a real question or a fancy question, you would probably see that nobody really thinks that it is a real question. Again, I think it is very important that we have this strong institution that is the ECB, that strong institution that is the Eurosystem, and that solid Governing Council which is delivering price stability and credible in doing so over the next 10 years. That being said, we need improvement in governance of the “E” letter in EMU. It seems to me that we have a good “M”. Of course, I do not want to be complacent in any respect. As I said, we have to be permanently alert, ready to take the appropriate decisions at any time without prior commitment. So, there is no complacency at all. But we have a track record for monetary union. The “E” must be improved, and I trust that it will be. Now on your first point, my general remark on the fact that observers should never underestimate the determination of Europeans in any circumstances is based upon my own experience. When times are very demanding, Europeans are taking decisions. And when I say Europeans, I am not referring to us. I am referring to the executive branches, when and where needed, and the European Parliament. But that is my own personal experience. I appreciate enormously the fact that they believe that we have delivered price stability in a way that is historically impressive. Do not forget that this is the mandate of this institution. I hope that nobody forgets – not only in Germany, but also in France and Italy – that in 2004 and 2005 there was a meeting of minds of respective Governments with a view to destroying the Stability and Growth Pact. I have to say, in retrospect, that I am a little surprised that our fight to maintain what is absolutely obvious – the necessity of a very strong and solid governance in terms of fiscal policies, because we have a single currency – was not supported by those people who are now saying that the system does not work very well. We were on the record as saying in 2005 that we had “grave concerns”. So, this is a process of “learning by doing”. Again, I am absolutely convinced that the Europeans will improve governance. Now, as you know, this is a matter, which is being discussed between the Council, the Parliament and the European Commission, in accordance with the rules of Europe. And secondly, if I can take another run at the bond purchase question: Is there any upper limit to how much money the ECB is prepared to commit to the SMP in order to ensure that you are transmitting monetary policy, or are you willing to do whatever it takes? On your first question, all vast continental economies such as the euro area and the United States have a degree of deviation in the growth rates of the different states or countries, deviation in their unit labour costs, deviation in their inflation rates and so forth – even deviation as regards unemployment. For instance, in the United States, the best state, if my memory is correct, has around 2.5% unemployment and the worst state has around 14%. As you can see, there are also big differences, and it is very easy to explain because you have different specialisations, and so, necessarily, you have business cycles that are not necessarily the same, although they are all correlated. So, I would just repeat that it is fortunate that those parts of the euro area economy that have regained competitiveness through hard work – as is the case for the German economy, but not only the German economy – can now be a source of growth, and this is, of course, to the benefit of the euro area as a whole. It was the reverse before, and that is the way you would expect things to be in a vast continental economy. On the SMP, I have never mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council limits of the programme and so I will not do so now either. We have a programme for Ireland, and the Governing Council supports this programme. I will not embark on any further discussion about that. And second, how do you view the reaction of the financial markets regarding Spain? I would reply in exactly the same way as I did to the question on Portugal. We are telling all countries, without exception, to implement as completely and convincingly as possible all the measures necessary for them to attain the fiscal goals that have been fixed for next year. And that is not a message particularly for Spain, but for all countries. It is absolutely essential in order to be totally credible. Governments have to be totally credible. It is a decision which has to be taken by the governments, and we call on all authorities to live up to their responsibilities. Every authority and institution has to live up to its own responsibility. I trust that we will remain in permanent contact with the authorities in question, namely the governments, so that they can demonstrate as clearly as possible that they are living up to their own responsibilities. It is extremely important that governments are credible. At the start of the turbulences, it was very clear that we were able to contain the pressure because we all had authority as public authorities. And clearly, what we have to do now — and this is not a remark just for Europe, but for all the advanced economies of the entire world — is to preserve, reinforce and consolidate the authority of the public authorities. I never comment on market observations in real time. Excessive volatility is not welcome, as you know. It is not good for global prosperity, global growth and for financial stability at the global level. I will say nothing more, which will not surprise you. "
04/11/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council continues to view the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. It therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 7 October 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with our assessment that the underlying momentum of the recovery remains positive. At the same time, uncertainty is prevailing. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Recent data releases and survey evidence generally confirm our view that the positive underlying momentum of the economic recovery in the euro area remains in place. In line with previous expectations, this implies ongoing real GDP growth in the second half of this year. The global recovery is expected to proceed, and this should imply a continued positive impact on the demand for euro area exports. At the same time, private sector domestic demand should contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty prevailing. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. On the other hand, some concerns remain relating to the re-emergence of tensions in financial markets. In addition, downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures, and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, as anticipated, euro area annual HICP inflation rose to 1.9% in October, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 1.8% in September. In the next few months HICP inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year. Overall, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside. They relate, in particular, to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are still expected to be contained. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was broadly unchanged, at 1.0% in September 2010, after 1.1% in August. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, at 1.2%, remained unchanged from August. Looking beyond developments in individual months, broad money and loan growth remains low and continues to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. The annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate, standing at 5.9% in September 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative. This reflects the widening spread between interest rates paid on short-term time deposits and those paid on overnight deposits. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector is increasingly supported by the flow of loans to non-financial corporations. The annual growth rate of these loans is still slightly negative, but developments in recent months suggest that a turning point was reached earlier in 2010. This would be consistent with the lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle that was also observed in past cycles. The annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 2.8% in September and thereby remained at levels seen in previous months. Banks have continued to gradually increase the weight of credit to the private sector in the overall size of their balance sheets, but the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. We therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 7 October 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with our assessment that the underlying momentum of the recovery remains positive. At the same time, uncertainty is prevailing. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, there is a clear need to strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to return to sustainable public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term. To this end, it is essential that countries pursue credible multi-year consolidation plans and fully implement the planned consolidation measures. In their 2011 budgets, they need to specify credible fiscal adjustment measures, focusing on the expenditure side. Any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. The urgent implementation of far-reaching structural reforms is essential to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. Major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. The removal of labour market rigidities and the strengthening of productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies. At their meeting on 28-29 October 2010 the EU Heads of State and Government agreed on the  reform of the European Union’s economic governance. The proposals put forward by President Van Rompuy represent a strengthening of the existing framework for fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance in the European Union. However, the Governing Council considers that they do not go as far as the quantum leap in the economic governance of Monetary Union that it has been calling for. In particular, the Governing Council is concerned that there would be insufficient automaticity in the implementation of fiscal surveillance, that there is no specification of the rule to reduce the government debt ratio, and that financial sanctions have not been explicitly retained under the macroeconomic surveillance procedure. With regard to the macroeconomic surveillance procedure in particular, the new system of mutual surveillance would need to concentrate firmly on euro area countries experiencing sustained losses of competitiveness and large current account deficits. It should be determined by transparent and effective trigger mechanisms. It would be essential that the assessments of macroeconomic imbalances and recommendations for corrective action be given broad publicity at all stages of the surveillance process. The public and the markets can be confident that the Governing Council remains firmly committed to delivering on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term. We are now at your disposal for questions. Secondly, recently we had the other Jean-Claude, Jean-Claude Juncker, coming up to the present, calling for more verbal discipline from the ECB and urging the ECB to speak more with one voice. We all know, of course, that you are the “porte-parole” of the ECB, and you are the one voice, but do you sometimes think he has a point? As regards your first question: we have our responsibility, we have our mandate and, as you know, and as we have demonstrated since the setting-up of the euro, the Governing Council of the ECB is faithful to its mandate. We are one of the central banks in the world which gives its very precise definition of price stability and permits observers to judge us on the results of our policy. As you know, we are very satisfied that for more than 11½ years, we have delivered price stability for 330 million fellow citizens in line with the definition of price stability that was given at the very beginning of the euro. So, no further comments on what is done by other central banks, which have their own responsibility and their own environment. On your second point, I must confess I did not see what Jean-Claude Juncker had said. I was wondering if perhaps it indirectly meant that in his own constituency from time to time verbal discipline might be appropriate. In any case, I do not comment on our own communication. As you said yourself, we have one Governing Council and one “porte-parole”. And my second question is, it relates to the weekend summit and there were some press reports that came out that you were not entirely happy, that you were opposing Angela Merkel’s plan to put in place a crisis resolution mechanism that places a clear burden on bond holders to foot part of the bill for any post-2013 bailouts. So could you clarify that? Are you opposed to that and why? I mean, isn’t it fair that taxpayers should not be the only ones footing the bill? On your first point, I never comment, as you know, on moves on the market on a day-to-day basis or minute-by-minute basis. Second, I have no indication that would change my trust in the fact that the Federal Reserve Chairman and the Secretary of the Treasury, not to mention the President of the United States, are not playing the strategy or tactics of a weak dollar. I have no reason not to believe them, and again I trust their statement that it is in the interest of the United States to have a strong dollar, strong vis-à-vis the other major floating currencies, including the euro. And I fully share this view. On your second point, I made remarks on the occasion of the European Council. These remarks were addressed to the presidents and the prime ministers that were in the European Council. They were not for anyone other than my interlocutors, again on this occasion the presidents and the prime ministers. I did not make public what I said on the occasion of the European Council. I consider that this is the property of the Heads of State and Government. Communication took place afterwards, and I don’t deny what has been repeated, but it was not repeated by me. It was repeated by those who were attending the meeting. At this stage I would say that the Governing Council of the ECB takes note of the prolongation of the work of President Van Rompuy, who is invited to undertake consultations on a limited Treaty change designed to create a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole. I stand ready to explain to President Van Rompuy and to the Commission – because these are the two persons or institutions that have been appointed by the European Council – the position of the Governing Council of the ECB, which is in favour of very strong conditionality. This would avoid the risk that such a permanent scheme would induce ex ante loose policies, and this is very important. In our view, all features of this new scheme should be designed both to induce the soundest policies – and in this respect, you measure the importance of all that we have said on the automaticity of the surveillance process itself, which we judge to be very important – and to help effectively to avoid systemic financial instability. As I said, I stand ready to transmit all these messages and views to Herman Van Rompuy and to the Commission, because they have been appointed to make proposals. My second question relates to the repeated warnings that we have heard in recent weeks against keeping interest rates too low for too long. Are you ready to repeat that warning now and can you explain what is behind these warnings? Would the ECB consider raising interest rates before inflationary pressures actually call for such a move? First, it is not a normal situation to have institutions that are “addicted” and we are continually reflecting on how to deal progressively with this problem, because we are not in a normal situation. So yes, we are constantly reflecting on what could be done, but I have no decision to announce to you right now. As regards our own framework and the possible decisions that we will take, bearing in mind what we have always said, which I repeated today on behalf of the Governing Council, the non-standard measures that we have taken are, by definition, of a transitory nature. We will give you a rendezvous at our next meeting. We will have to make up our minds for the next month and decide what to do. The rendezvous is scheduled for December. As regards your second question on interest rates, I can only say once again that you know the extent to which we are never pre-committed. Our doctrine is that we take decisions that are appropriate, taking into account that we have to deliver price stability over the medium term. I also said, and that it is very important, that there is no correlation between non-standard measures on the one hand and our own interest rates on the other. We can move interest rates without necessarily having totally ended the non-standard measures. We have always made that point and I will continue to do so. That said, taking everything into account, as we always do, we consider the present interest rates to be appropriate. Second, with regard to euro area governance, in the initial proposals you made at the start of this process, you talked about a crisis resolution mechanism and you very deliberately left out any suggestion that this mechanism could oversee a debt restructuring. Can you explain why the ECB opposes the idea of such a mechanism having a debt rescheduling facility? In response to your first question, when we decide on our own policy, we consider all of the parameters that are important. It is clear that all of the information we have on developments in the US economy, the first economy among the advanced economies of the world, as well as all the information we have on the overall economic, financial and monetary situation, is important. I would not say that we have drawn any pre-conclusions about the influence of the decisions taken by the US central bank. I will just say that it seems to me that the majority of observers had the decision very much in their minds. On your second point, we will clarify our message to Herman Van Rompuy and to the Commission. They have the task of putting both; the Treaty changes itself, and the precise mechanism into a precise form. To my knowledge, this is not yet the case: nobody has delivered a precise mechanism or a precise framework. Comparing with what we are reflecting on in Europe, take, for instance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is, after all, the global mechanism that exists to help countries and economies in difficulty to recover and adjust with very strong conditionality. The IMF does not make necessarily the ex-ante working assumption that the relationship with markets, investors and savers is interrupted. It can be, but it is not the ex-ante compulsory assumption. Let us look back over the past 20 or 30 years, and estimate the proportion of cases in which this kind of intervention by the IMF occurred alongside the interruption of the normal functioning of the financing of the economy through hair-cuts and generalized restructuring. Depending on the period under consideration, the proportion might be the following: in more than 75% of cases there was no such interruption of the normal relationship and only in less than 25% of cases there was. Of course, it can never be excluded, but this assumption is not made as compulsory ex ante. I would say the assumption made is the contrary. I am speaking about the IMF. So, we will reflect on all of that, and I have a great deal of confidence in President Van Rompuy and in the Commission to take into account absolutely all of the elements that are necessary to make a precise proposal, which – again – has so far not yet been made. I will let you know when both the survey of professional forecasters and our new staff projections are published. You will have heard me say that we were confident as regards the solid anchoring of our inflationary expectations, which the Governing Council has always considered to be our major asset. In that we have delivered price stability and are credible in the delivery of price stability. This is our mandate. It is our primary mandate. I remember saying that last time when you were asking me questions on countries X, Y and Z. Our own responsibility is to deliver price stability to 330 million people, and we have done that. We are credible in doing that, and it helps us in all circumstances. It prevents both inflationary and deflationary risks from materialising. We have always been protected from such events, and I think this is very much due to the solid anchoring of our expectations at below, but close to, 2%. Secondly, the government in Dublin is preparing a four-year austerity programme. It has declared that the adjustment will be in the order of €15 billion over the course of the four years. Is that figure going in the right direction? Are you encouraged by it, are you encouraged by the debate that is taking place in Ireland or is there more that you would like to see, and why? It is now 3 p.m. If I understand correctly, the Irish government will announce the details of the four-year programme this afternoon. I would only say at this stage that, in our view, the €15 billion figure you mention is currently sufficient. But, of course, you have to be permanently alert and ready to do whatever is needed. The ultimate goal, which, to my knowledge, has also been made public, is the 3% at the end of the period. I think that the market, as well as observers, savers and investors, will be looking at what the minister and the government say in a few hours’ time with great interest. My interpretation is that this government message, which will focus on the frontloading of the programme, is of extreme importance. At present, I have no reason to think that observers will be disappointed but, of course, I cannot say anything else. It is up to the minister to deliver the message. And my second question do you share the concern of those governments that their taxpayers do not foot the bill again in the event of a new sovereign debt crisis? I have already responded to the second point. On the first point, I never comment on what my colleagues are saying. And a second question on the bond programme: it has now been three weeks in which you have not bought any securities. Does that mean it is over? On your second question, I have already said that it is not over. On your first question, we will all listen to what the government of Ireland announces, which will be of extreme importance. It is my expectation that something very important will be said this afternoon in a few hours from now.  And, second, a question with regards to money market rates: the three-month EURIBOR is actually now above the ECB benchmark rate of 1%. Aren’t you, on the other hand, discouraging interbank lending if you continue to offer banks three-month loans at 1%? On your first question, I would only remind you what we did with the Securities Markets Programme. We launched this programme in May in order to help restore a more normal functioning of our monetary policy transmission mechanism. And, as you know pretty well, we never targeted any particular spreads or whatever on the market. And that is absolutely obvious, because you know month after month and week after week what we are doing and you can see what happens. So, no other comment on that. On your second point, we consider that the unlimited supply of liquidity is there. As I also explained last time, the banks are asking for all they need, because there is no limit, either on the main refinancing operations, or for the one-month window, or for the three-month window. So, because we did not change our rates (neither the MRO nor the deposit rate was changed), what we have observed in the market is that the positioning of EONIA, the very short-term rates, is dependent on the decisions of the banks themselves. It is a kind of equilibrium which depends on what the banks themselves are asking for, and you can see that it goes up and down from time to time, very much depending on the demand from the banks themselves. So, there is no particular signal there. The only important observation I would make is that it shows that we are in a normalising process, and that is an important element. But again, from our part, there was no signal at all – no monetary policy signal. This normalising has been taking place under our eyes, and we will see what happens later on. That is the observation I would make, and I have to say that, for me, a normalising is something positive. It also indicates that perhaps the EONIA means more today than it meant before, because before perhaps only a very small fraction of the institutions had access to this very low interest rate refinancing. I will certainly not embark on disentangling the various factors that might have played a role. You might have seen what the market literature was saying. You have a lot of different views, as always, on the market. I would only say that what we have in front of us now is, to my knowledge, not a two-country proposal but a European Council call to Mr Van Rompuy and to the European Commission. And you know the text, because it has been made public. That is where we are in terms of developments. I would say, in that respect, no more and no less than in the last meeting. We did not change our judgement on that front. We see, obviously, this slight tilting up, but there is no change in our overall judgement today in comparison with a month ago. I do not think so. Frankly speaking, I have a mandate of precisely eight years and the mandate of eight years is there to give you authority until the last moment, the last day. In any case, I have the immense honour to preside over the Governing Council and Vítor has the immense honour to vice-preside over the Governing Council. The Governing Council is the authority which takes the decisions and I have a profound trust in collegial wisdom. I have always said that we have no other appreciation when we examine the monetary policy than to make a synthesis out of all the information that is available and, of course, exchange rates are part of that available information. But in addition to the moves in the exchange rate, a very large number of other factors equally play a role. I do not want to try to disentangle what would be precisely due to the exchange rate. In any case, I have already said what I have to say on the euro/dollar relationship. I already said that we had in place our Securities Markets Programme. We have our observation of the functioning of the markets and we do what we judge appropriate according to what we are observing. Let me just say the following: what counts is the soundness of the policies pursued by governments. We have always had this position. We defended the Stability and Growth Pact when it was criticised heavily. We opposed and expressed our grave concerns publicly in 2005 when the Stability and Growth Pact was revised. Unfortunately, we see now that everybody agrees with these grave concerns that we had expressed. We had called permanently for a rigorous implementation of the Pact and we have been calling permanently, including in the most recent weeks and months, for changing policies. And, I have to say that in a number of cases governments have redressed their policies and their fiscal policy in particular. There is also the introduction of a new surveillance mechanism. From that standpoint, let me only mention, for the record, that we were the first to call for this new surveillance mechanism on relative competitiveness and on imbalances more than five years ago. We should follow that very carefully in the Eurogroup. Now we have an agreement to introduce this surveillance mechanism and I have to say that this is something which is important, even if – as I said – we consider that it is not sufficiently strong. But it goes in the right direction; it did not exist before. I have already said everything that I have to say on this particular point. Again, what will be designed has, in our view, to be designed to reinforce financial stability and, of course, not to go against financial stability in the euro area as a whole. And secondly, you mentioned a little while ago trusting collegial wisdom. I think you were talking about the ECB. Could you expand a little bit on the importance of collegiality? On your second question first, you know that the Treaty is there. All decisions that are taken on monetary policy are taken by the Governing Council and namely by all colleagues on the basis of “one person, one vote”. This is something which is remarkable, I have to say, and it is what the Treaty is calling for. As regards the Executive Board, we are six and we take our decisions as a college of six. Of course, this does not mean that there is not an important role for the President or the Vice-President. But again, it is a college and I think that is the case in all the important central banks I know. In all the important central banks I know, the decisions are taken by a college, because you need to have a full understanding of the multi-dimensionality of the situation. Pros and cons have to be weighed and you also need different angles of vision and experience, which I trust we have in the Governing Council of the ECB, as well as in the Executive Board. And I would say it is the same in the Federal Open Market Committee in Washington or in the Monetary Policy Committee in London. So we have there a feature of independent central banks that is, I trust, fundamental. On your first question, let me only say that while we have some countries that are in a situation where they have to adjust because they have experienced very fast growth and in some cases bubbles over the last years, I am satisfied that some other countries are growing rapidly. When I look at those countries that are now adjusting, and particularly those that were in serious difficulty, I am happy that at the same time Germany for instance is growing at a relatively rapid pace, much more rapid than in the past. This is of course positive. When you are at the level of an entire continent with 330 million people, with a very large and diverse set of economies, it is normal that you have a degree of heterogeneity. So when we compare with the United States, we see the same kind of differences between the various states. Of course, this does not mean at all that we are satisfied with the surveillance which has been exerted inside the euro area over the last years. We call for a quantum leap and that would certainly diminish some of the heterogeneity that you just mentioned.  And then secondly, as far as the Fed and the Bank of Japan are concerned, I believe they are meeting on Friday, it looks like they will be providing enough cover for the ECB to potentially take more action to provide economic support for the euro area? Do you think that there is any need to do so? In other words, would their quantitative easing programmes give the ECB political coverage to take or to undertake more action here in the euro area to reduce risks to the economic outlook? I already said that we all had our responsibilities, we were, I trust, all faithful to our mandate and to our responsibilities. I have nothing else to say on your second question. On the first question, again, all our non-standard measures are transitory in nature. I say this in each meeting we have. They are transitory by nature — first. Second, I also said that the Securities Markets Programme was in place. Third, beware of not realising the fact that we provide information every week and the information comes after the transactions have been settled. So you have always information that is not real-time information. It addresses what happened a number of working days before. So, I would say that you will see in the future that the programme exists. Again, nothing else to add. And the second question pertains to the Introductory Statement, last month you still said that you expected domestic demand to strengthen further, you dropped that this month, is that a message or just a change of language? As regards your second question – it is just a change of language; in any case our new projections will be given at the next meeting at the beginning of December. On your first question on exchange rates, I already mentioned very clearly what our position was as regards the major floating currencies. Now you ask a question on a larger number of currencies, which are not the major floating currencies, and there you know our own message, which is very clear. Orientations have been taken, particularly in the Toronto Summit, so that the currencies concerned would progressively make their exchange rates more flexible. We consider that this is going in the right direction, that it is certainly in the interest of those currencies that are not, as we speak, sufficiently flexible. It is also in the interest of the entire international community. So, that message is also clear and I would say that it is a message which comes from the international community itself, not only from us. No, it is certainly not the right interpretation. We are in a position where we feel, perhaps more intensively, the importance of having the economic union functioning as well as possible. We are responsible for the monetary union. We are already, if I may say, a monetary federation. And, of course, it puts us in a situation where we see things very clearly. We feel the importance, of the good functioning, the appropriate functioning of the economic union itself, with great intensity. And we consider; the Governing Council considers it as its duty and as very important to ship our messages to the Council, to the Eurogroup, to the 27 as well as to the 16, particularly the 16 in the euro area. I said that what has been approved, namely the Van Rompuy report, was going in the right direction. It’s undoubtedly progress, we do not deny that. But to take into account the fact that we are in a monetary federation, we have to go much further in the direction of more automaticity. It is our duty to make those points so. I am not saying today that I would pre-announce major difficulties if they don’t do everything, all that we are calling for. But in any case, we are still in a moment of time where there are discussions; you have the Council, you have the Parliament and you have the Commission. And the procedure in Europe is a procedure which calls for appropriate discussion inside the Parliament, between the Parliament and the Council. So again, it is our duty to say candidly, serenely, but also firmly what we see and what we trust. Before answering your question I believe that at the last press conference you asked me a question on the pension reforms and I would just like to confirm what I said last time, namely that we approve the pension reform in France. We consider it to be a very important structural reform. It was absolutely necessary and we approve this structural reform, just as we have approved other bold structural reforms embarked upon by a number of governments in difficult circumstances. Now as regards your question I would say that the Governing Council on the introductory statement, we were unanimous. "
07/10/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council continues to view the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. It therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 September 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with our expectation that the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace in the second half of this year, with the underlying momentum remaining positive. At the same time, uncertainty is still prevailing. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP grew strongly on a quarterly basis, increasing by 1.0% in the second quarter of 2010, supported mainly by domestic demand, but partly reflecting temporary factors. Recent statistical releases and survey evidence generally confirm our expectation of a moderation in the second half of this year in the euro area and elsewhere. Nevertheless, the positive underlying momentum of the recovery in the euro area remains in place. The global recovery is expected to go on, and this should imply a continued positive impact on the demand for euro area exports. At the same time, private sector domestic demand should gradually strengthen further, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty still prevailing. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. On the other hand, concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets. In addition, downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in September, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 1.6% in August. The increase in inflation was anticipated and reflects base effects mainly stemming from the energy component. In the next few months HICP inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year. Overall, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside. They relate, in particular, to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 rose to 1.1% in August 2010, from 0.2% in July. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also rose, standing at 1.2%, after 0.8% in the previous month. In both cases, the rise reflects relatively strong monthly flows. The still low growth rates continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. The yield curve has remained fairly steep, but the downward impact of this on monetary growth is gradually waning. Moreover, while spreads between different short-term interest rates are still generally narrow, they have been widening somewhat between rates paid on short-term time deposits and overnight deposits. As a result, the annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate from high levels, and stood at 7.7% in August 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative. The rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector reflects both a further slight increase in the positive growth of loans to households and a gradually less negative annual growth rate in loans to non-financial corporations. The latest developments are consistent with the lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle that was also observed in past cycles. Banks have gradually increased the overall size of their balance sheets recently, but the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up further. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. We therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 September 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with our expectation that the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace in the second half of this year, with the underlying momentum remaining positive. At the same time, uncertainty is still prevailing. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, we take note of the recent announcements made in some euro area countries with regard to measures to tackle the existing fiscal imbalances. Indeed, a number of countries have to meet major challenges, and immediate, ambitious and convincing corrective action is required. Credible multi-year consolidation plans are needed and will strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to return to sustainable public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term. For all euro area countries, the 2011 budgets need to reflect the commitment to ambitious fiscal consolidation in line with countries’ pledges under the excessive deficit procedures. Any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. The urgent implementation of far-reaching structural reforms is essential to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. The removal of labour market rigidities and the strengthening of productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate industrial restructuring and encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies. We are now at your disposal for questions. And my second question relates to the fact that credit conditions in the euro area have tightened quite considerably as a result of the appreciation of the euro against the dollar and the increase in money market rates. Are you comfortable with that, given the lack of inflationary pressures? And in relation to that, do you see a risk of a global currency war? With regard to your question on banks: when a number of our previous refinancing operations matured, we observed that banks were asking for less refinancing than they had asked before. As you know, we are still following the mode of supplying liquidity with full allotment at fixed rate on one-week, one-month and three-month durations. The fact that we have observed a €79 billion euro reduction in demand for liquidity has, in our opinion, been interpreted correctly by the market as proof of progressive normalisation. It was the banks themselves who decided that they needed less liquidity than before, and this has had an impact on money market interest rates. This was not something that we engineered ourselves and there is absolutely no monetary policy signal in this market move. Rather, it was a decision taken by euro area commercial banks in an environment where liquidity is still available through operations with full allotment. As regards the issue of banks being addicted to central bank liquidity, I do not want to attach too much significance to the fact that there has been a €79 billion reduction in demand for liquidity. In a number of cases, we still need to ask the appropriate decision-makers to do what is necessary, because it is not a normal situation to have a number of institutions still very much in need of refinancing. As you know we call upon all banks to continue to take all appropriate measures to reinforce their balance sheet as well as their capital base and adhere to the decisions taken. Furthermore, when and where needed they can, and must, ask the public authorities, which have already committed themselves to providing appropriate capital support, to activate this support. As regards the issue of exchange rates, I would stress that, more than ever, exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability, which is something we will be able to exchange views on with the authorities - central bank governors and ministers of finance - of the major floating currencies in Washington over the next few days. My message will be the same as my answer to your question: excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. And, as you have heard me say on a number of occasions, I have always shared the view of the US authorities that a strong dollar is in the interests of the United States. Second, the German newspapers write very often that a very strong euro makes a weaker Europe. Do you believe that? And do you believe that Europe should cooperate financially with China, that our alliance should be with China at that moment? First of all, what is extremely important – not for Greece in particular but for all countries – is to give full substantiation and credibility to the targets that have been decided upon and approved in order to ensure that observers, economic agents, investors and savers see that the fiscal adjustment programmes in the country concerned are on track and fully confirmed by the appropriate measures. That is the response to your first question. As regards your second question I do not know which German paper you are reading – there are a large number of German journalists present now – but I have not read that. On exchange rates, I have already said all that I have to say as regards the relationship between the major floating currencies. As regards China, we have had an important discussion at the level of the euro area, and at the level of Europe as a whole, with the Chinese Government. I was in Brussels with the other members of the so-called euro area troika and we met with the Chinese authorities. I said then that it is very important that the exchange rate policy reform announced by China on 19 June this year is implemented. The flexibility offered by this new policy framework is important and would allow an orderly and gradual appreciation of the Renminbi in effective terms. This decision of 19 June has been reaffirmed by the Chinese Government, and we believe this will be positive for growth in China and for balanced growth at a global level. Second, might you ever think of prolonging the stability programme for Greece if the conditions in the markets are not very favourable at the end of the programme? Can I take the opportunity of this further question on a particular country to reiterate the fact that the Governing Council of the ECB is responsible for the currency of 330 million people at present, and the figure will rise to more than 330 million people as early as next January when the seventeenth country joins the euro area. All my colleagues, the Vice-President and myself have to determine what is necessary to deliver price stability to 330 million people in the medium term. It is what we do. Over the first 11½ years we have delivered average annual inflation rate of 1.97% – less than 2%, but close to 2%. All the information from financial markets as well as from various panels and surveys confirms that, for the next five or ten years, they are also projecting inflation in line with our definition of price stability. 11½ years behind us, 5-10 years ahead of us: this is a very impressive period of time. We have delivered to our 330 million fellow citizens the best result that has been observed for 50 years in the countries of the euro area. I say that with emphasis because it is the mandate that we have received from our fellow citizens and from our democracies. We have a primary mandate and we fulfil this primary mandate at the level of an entire continent – which is comparable to the size of the United States – with 330 million people. At the level of individual countries and economies of the euro area, responsibilities lie with the various capitals. And we call upon all capitals to ensure that they pursue a convincing path towards fiscal sustainability. We have always said that and we continue to say it with great determination and force. It is our main message. We also say that appropriate structural reforms are of the essence and when losses in competitiveness are registered, they have to be corrected. This is not a new message – it is a message that the ECB constantly conveys through all possible channels, including, of course, directly to Ministers of Finance when the Vice-President and I participate in the Eurogroup meetings. Secondly, in the first nine months of this year bank investments in high-risk, junk bonds have increased by a whopping 55%. Are you not disturbed by this when you say that you confirm the unlimited liquidity allotment? Are you not disturbed by the fact that banks are making more high-risk investments than in previous years? Do you have any ideas or plans of how to change this? Thirdly, have you changed your mind on Glass-Steagall? First of all, you might remember that Greece benefited from extraordinary aid from the other countries and is already activating extraordinary aid. So I am a little bit surprised by what you say. It is true that a country benefiting from the Stabilisation Fund would not contribute to it at the same time. But, again, Greece is in a different situation from that standpoint because it is already benefiting from another extraordinary financing. On the second question, we and supervisors in all countries are calling on all banks to be extremely attentive to their risk management. This is, of course, absolutely of the essence not just at the present time, but at all times. As regards our full allotment mode, which, as you know and as I have said, is a non-standard measure that still exists, I would only say the following. In our understanding of the overall assessment of the functioning of markets at the level of the euro area as a whole and taking into account the fact that the market has not been functioning correctly until now at least, we still consider it necessary to have this non-standard way. It is designed in particular to permit the monetary policy transmission channel to function as well as possible. When we are analysing the situation, we have, on the one hand, our interest rate and standard measures that are there to ensure price stability in the medium term. We were credible in the past, we have delivered, we have a track record and we are credible for the future. And the main aim of the non-standard measures is to help establish, re-establish or restore more appropriate functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, taking into account the fact that part of the market is not functioning normally. On Glass-Steagall, I have no particular comment to make. But I remember mentioning here, responding to the same question, that we were not necessarily in the same universe in Europe in comparison with the United States of America, and, at this stage, I will not say that the model of universal banking is to be abandoned in Europe. And my second question is that, when you were listing the possible risks – downside risks – to growth, you have dropped this time the reference to uncertainty about growth prospects in other advanced economies, which seems a bit strange because that seems to be arguably the biggest risk at the moment. Perhaps you could you explain why it is not there and what your thinking is on that point. First of all, you might have seen that we have embarked on an exercise of concision, because we had observed that, after a certain period of time, the ‘literary exercise’ of the Introductory Statement resulted in longer texts. So you have a more concise text. But concision does not mean that we are changing our assessment. And, particularly on your first question, I would say that the wording that you see in this Introductory Statement is the merger of sentences that were in the previous assessments. So we did not change our assessment on the non-standard measures, the allotment mode, the provision of liquidity at all, and we are exactly in the same mood as we were a month ago. There is no change in our own attitude, and we will, as we said last month and continue to say this month, continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Again, all depends on the situation we see on our own market and whether or not we judge that it is appropriate to continue to help restore the more appropriate functioning of our monetary policy transmission channel. That is in response to your question on exit strategy. As regards your second question on the overall assessment of the situation, frankly, we have not changed our views. The present situation is obviously better than expected, that is clear. It has been confirmed by all the international institutions, and the IMF itself is revising growth in Europe upwards. It is a pure observation of reality, as it has been observed in the second quarter in particular. But we are not declaring victory. We are not saying that we are in a mode of active and rapid growth. We consider that we have to remain very cautious and very prudent. We do not consider that, for instance, the profile of growth next year has changed. We said this month, as we said a month ago, that we saw the growth projections being tilted slightly on the downside. When we address the global economy, we do, of course, incorporate the biggest economy in the world, and I do not think there is any message that we wanted to convey to qualify differently what could happen in the United States of America. We have no particular comment on the United States. I am very anxious to hear Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke when we are in Washington, for a few days. Let me only say that, in assessing the situation, we have to be very careful to always remain cautious and prudent. There is a tendency for observers to amplify. So, when you have good news, you have a media, a communication tendency to say “well, it’s fantastic; it’s a very important, buoyant growth”. But when we had good news in the second quarter, we never said ourselves that “we are now in a mode of buoyant growth”. We were prudent and cautious. And the same goes for news that is much less flattering. It is a mistake to immediately interpret it as signalling some kind of medium-term drama. Volatility is part of the world as it functions, and we have to continue to have a sense of direction and a sense of the medium or medium to long-term perspective, which is never as good or as bad as the immediate judgment might suggest. So, again, we are keeping our composure permanently. We are on a modest growth path. We are not declaring victory. We have to permanently be very alert. And my second question in relation to that would be: what are your ideas on an optimal international currency order in the future and what role should the G20 play in your view? It has always been reaffirmed by the G20, as well as other “G” communiqués and messages from central banks, that the solid anchoring of inflation expectations in line with price stability is a major contribution to sustained, non-inflationary growth. It is true for the advanced economies as well as for the emerging economies, on which we are counting very much to help the global economy to deliver this sustained, non-inflationary growth. The inflationary tensions in a number of economies worldwide justify policy interest rate moves. As regards our own judgement, I was very clear on the fact that we consider our present monetary policy stance as appropriate and we have fully confirmed our interest rates. As regards exchange rates, I have already responded to the question. On the one hand, excessive volatility in the exchange rates of the major free-floating currencies has adverse implications. On the other hand, we are having discussions with a number of emerging market countries, including China. On your last question I would only say that we have to distinguish very clearly the present situation. I mentioned to what extent I considered that in the present situation it was important that the US authorities – the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury – say that a strong dollar is in the interests of the United States. We have in the medium to long term another issue, which is associated with the structural transformation of the world and with the fact that some currencies that are today not fully convertible or free-floating will become one day fully convertible. That of course calls for reflection on the long-term perspective of structural change in the constellation of major currencies in the world. I’m speaking, of course, about the Chinese currency, but not only about the Chinese currency – about a number of other currencies of remarkable economies of emerging market countries that are developing very rapidly. I have a very simple comment on that. When we look at the long-term perspective of all advanced economies in the world – not only those in Europe – it is absolutely clear that the management of pensions, and of the retirement age and so forth, is absolutely key. We have to deal with a very welcome lengthening of the duration of our own lives. It is something that is continuing very impressively. Year after year, depending on the various countries involved, we are gaining several – more or fewer – months of life expectancy. We have to take the appropriate structural reforms necessary to take that into account. This is never easy. I experienced that myself in this institution when we had to reform our pension arrangements. It is always difficult, but we have to understand that this is absolutely necessary. Second, is it feasible for the Irish authorities to climb the mountain they have ahead of them without looking at corporation tax? There seems to be a view in Brussels that it is going to be very difficult to achieve what needs to be achieved without doing that. On the first question: it is a question that has to be addressed to the Irish government. I have no particular comment to make myself. On the second question, I would say that it is extremely important that the Irish Government takes all appropriate decisions that would facilitate the credible path towards the sustainability of public finances. As you know, there has been a very important declaration by the Irish Government in this respect that has recently been made public. There are deadlines mentioned by the Irish Government, and we consider it to be absolutely essential that the commitment undertaken is converted into appropriate action. I will not comment on any particular measure. I have no position of the Governing Council to present, but the goal is absolutely clear. And the second question: Is there any talk within the ECB about possibly changing collateral rules to try to encourage those banks relying very heavily on the ECB to find other sources of funding? On the first point, let me just say that we decided to implement this programme several months ago. The aim of the programme, as I have already said several times, is to help the monetary policy transmission mechanism to function as correctly as possible. On the second question, we are permanently reviewing our policy, so I have no particular comment on that point. I think that when Germany – being the first ‘client’ of many, if not all, members of the euro area – is growing above average it is very good for Germany and for the euro area as a whole As you know, Germany, during the first nine or ten years of the euro, had to regain the level of competitiveness that it had lost because of the impact of reunification. So, Germany has had a long period of catching-up, with growth in real terms that was not buoyant at all, when at the same time other countries had very rapid growth. Now, it is the reverse. It is natural, in a wide economy such as ours, with 16 countries and 330 million people, that you have fluctuations and cycles corresponding to an idiosyncratic situation. Germany was the only country that had to cope with reunification, so it is not abnormal that, for a while, Germany was growing less rapidly than the average of the euro area and a number of other countries. Conversely, at a certain moment, it started to grow more rapidly. Furthermore, Germany, because of its international position, was also touched, perhaps more than others, by the collapse of the global economy. So, putting all this together, I am very happy with Germany’s new buoyancy. It is good for Germany and it is good for the euro area as a whole. And I do not see any particular problem at this stage with the good surprise that we have in the German economy. Yes. You could see precisely this progressive phasing-out taking place over the last few days. In interrupting the six-month operations and the twelve-month operations, we observed the impact on liquidity demand and also the interaction with the market. But again, I confirm that there was absolutely no policy signalling in what we have observed, we are still in a mode of full allotment. We are delivering all the liquidity that is requested by our commercial banks. I would say that in the Governing Council, as is normal in such matters, each brain has a right half and a left half: we all assess the pros and cons of the situation. We do not in any way challenge the fact that we need the non-standard measures at the moment. So there is a consensus on that. We will have to make a judgement and decide what the new mode will be sufficiently far in advance. I draw again your attention to the following: we consider that the non-standard measures and the standard measures must not be confused. The standard measures are there to deliver price stability in the medium term in line with our definition. The non-standard measures have to be commensurate with the functioning of the markets: if we have disruption here, or and anomaly in the functioning of some markets there, we have to cope with it to get a more normal transmission of our monetary policy impulses. We are living in democracies, very fortunately, all over Europe. I would only say that the programme which has been decided and has to be implemented fully in line with previous commitment is extremely important for Greece, for the Greek economy, for Greek medium-term growth. What is being implemented in Greece today seems to us absolutely of the essence and, in our opinion, has to be executed in a very attentive fashion. If we were, I wouldn’t tell you. But, in any case I have no comment. I never comment on such matters. It is an absolute and constant policy that we pursue. Let me only say that we will have a discussion, as I have already said, on the exchange market – because your question was not on monetary policy but on the exchange market, if I understood correctly. I have already said all that I had to say at the present moment on the exchange market. No, I said it is important for all countries. Greece has a programme that has to be implemented rigorously. Portugal has recently made declarations which are, in our opinion, extremely important and have to be followed up. I have already responded about Ireland: we very much welcome the commitment by the government, which has to be turned into precise decisions and actions. So, it’s a universal recommendation, not addressed to any country in particular. I’m taking advantage of all the Greek questions, and perhaps also the Irish questions, to re-state that we are an institution that is responsible for price stability at the level of sixteen countries – and as of 1 January next year, seventeen countries – with the size comparable to the United States of America. We have to consider the continent as a whole and not merely one particular country. "
02/09/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council continues to view the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. It therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 5 August 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Recent economic data for the euro area have been stronger than expected, partly owing to temporary factors. Looking ahead, the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace, with uncertainty still prevailing. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. The Governing Council has today also decided to continue to conduct its main refinancing operations (MROs) and its special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of this year’s twelfth maintenance period on 18 January 2011. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, it has decided to conduct the 3-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), to be carried out in October, November and December 2010, as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these 3-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. The Governing Council has also decided to carry out three additional fine-tuning operations on 30 September, 11 November and 23 December when 6-month and 12-month refinancing operations mature. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. Monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the Securities Markets Programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. We remain firmly committed to maintaining price stability over the medium to longer term. The monetary policy stance, the overall provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. After a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. Euro area real GDP grew strongly on a quarterly basis, increasing by 1.0% in the second quarter of 2010, supported by ongoing growth at the global level but also in part reflecting temporary domestic factors. Recent data and survey evidence generally confirm the expectation of a moderation in the second half of this year, both at the global level and in the euro area. Nevertheless, while uncertainty still prevails, they continue to indicate a positive underlying momentum of the recovery in the euro area. Ongoing growth at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should continue to support the euro area economy. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real GDP growth will range between 1.4% and 1.8% in 2010 and between 0.5% and 2.3% in 2011. Compared with the June 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the range for real GDP growth this year has been revised upwards, owing to the stronger than expected rebound in economic growth in the second quarter as well as better than expected developments over the summer months. For 2011 the range has also been revised upwards, reflecting mainly carry-over effects from the projected stronger growth towards the end of 2010. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this improved economic outlook are slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty still prevailing. On the one hand, global trade may continue to perform more strongly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. On the other hand, concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets and to some uncertainty about growth prospects in other advanced economies and at the global level. In addition, downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in August, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 1.7% in July. The small decline in inflation is likely to reflect base effects in the energy component. Later in the year annual HICP inflation rates are expected to increase slightly while displaying some volatility. Looking further ahead, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate overall, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% for 2010 and between 1.2% and 2.2% for 2011. Compared with the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections of June 2010, the ranges have been revised slightly upwards, largely on account of higher commodity prices. Risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside. They relate, in particular, to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 stood at 0.2% in July 2010, unchanged from June. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, which has been gradually increasing, rose further to 0.9%, but still remains relatively weak. The subdued developments in money and loan growth continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. The downward impact of the steep yield curve on monetary growth, which is reflected in the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3, is gradually waning. Moreover, the impact of the narrow spreads between different short-term interest rates on the growth of the components of M3 is continuing to diminish. As a result, the annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate from high levels, and stood at 8.1% in July 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative. The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector continues to conceal positive growth in loans to households and diminishing negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations. These developments are consistent with a normal, lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle. Given the subdued developments in banks’ overall balance sheets, the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 5 August 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Recent economic data for the euro area have been stronger than expected, partly owing to temporary factors. Looking ahead, the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace, with uncertainty still prevailing. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, current developments at the euro area aggregate level appear to be broadly in line with previous expectations. At the country level, any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected macroeconomic environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. At the same time, in countries where there is still a need to take additional specific measures to achieve consolidation targets, such measures should be adopted swiftly to ensure that consolidation commitments are fulfilled. This is a prerequisite for maintaining confidence in the credibility of governments’ fiscal targets. Positive effects on confidence can compensate for the reduction in demand stemming from fiscal consolidation, when fiscal adjustment strategies are perceived as credible, ambitious and focused on the expenditure side. The conditions for such positive effects are particularly favourable in the current environment of macroeconomic uncertainty. In order to support the process of fiscal consolidation, to underpin the proper functioning of the euro area and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth, the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential. Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. Measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly and appropriately to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness. Reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies. We are now at your disposal for questions. And the second one: spreads between German bonds and those of peripheral countries have widened considerably over the past month and yet bond purchases are only marginal. I would be interested in why that is and whether it would be fair to conclude that you think the market is functioning in an orderly way. If that is the case, then why do you not just terminate the programme? On the first question, I respond very clearly that there is absolutely no signal of monetary policy in this technical decision we have taken to index on the average of the MRO rate, the interest rate of the three-month operation. As you might have observed, there was no pre-announcement of any interest rate increases in the past when we took the same technical decisions for other durations. So I am absolutely clear that the Governing Council has no intention to signal any change in the present interest rates, which we consider appropriate, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council. We consider that this is a technical measure that is appropriate, taking into account the overall situation, just as we considered in the past that it was appropriate for different durations. It is absolutely not a signal of future monetary policy, which remains, as always, entirely designed to ensure a solid anchoring of inflation expectations and the delivery of price stability. By the way, your first question gives me the opportunity to mention that, when you compute the average yearly inflation during the first eleven and a half years of the euro, you obtain 1.97%. Less than, but close to 2%. As a matter of fact, very close to 2%. This is the best result in terms of price stability that has been observed over the last 50 years in, say, Germany, France, Italy or Spain; the best result for the euro itself and for the euro area as a whole fully in line with our definition of price stability. On your second question, we have said very clearly that the purpose of the Securities Market Programme was to help to restore a better functioning of our monetary policy transmission channel, and we continue to adjust what we do with exactly this purpose in mind. And the other question is that, you rightfully mentioned that the history of the euro and the track record of the euro are better even than that of the Deutsche Mark. Why, then, do you think it is sometimes so difficult for politicians and maybe also for central bankers to bring the euro and its advantages home to the people and to the market? To start with your second question I think it depends also very much on you as well and how you communicate our message. We have achieved something remarkable in terms of price stability. This is not a judgement. These are facts and figures that can be checked by anybody. So, we will continue to make the point that we are inflexibly attached to deliver price stability and that we are delivering price stability. And, by the way, the sentiment of the markets, observers and different panels as regards future inflation is fully in line with our past performance and with our inflexible goal of price stability, because I see a very solid anchoring of inflation expectations, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council in today’s introductory statement. As regards your first question on the money markets, as you might have seen, we have taken a set of measures today. At 3.30 p.m. you will be given a press release containing a fully fledged explanation of the various decisions taken, including the three fine-tuning operations, which will allow us to be sure that, when we have the maturities of the previous long-term operations, there is the appropriate supply of liquidity to the markets. We will continue to very carefully follow what happens in the money markets, which, in our eyes, are on their way to functioning more normally. But it is a process which takes time. Second, last month you said with some confidence that the euro area will not see a double-dip recession. Can you reiterate that statement today with the same level of confidence? With regard to the first question, we are withdrawing part of the previous non-standard measures. The three fine-tuning operations are there precisely to cope with the end of the maturity of the last six-month and twelve-month operations. It is clear that we are in a process. The process of withdrawing these long-term operations is in operation. Our decisions today, we believe, are appropriate and commensurate with the situation that we are observing. From that standpoint, as you know, we look at the markets with great attention. Our overall intention is to consider the non-standard measures as coping with the abnormal functioning of some markets. To the extent that we can observe a normalisation of the situation, we will continue to withdraw these non-standard measures. The decisions today speak for themselves. With regard to the rate hikes, I have said already that we consider the present interest rates to be appropriate taking everything into account. I have said that we had no intention of signalling any intentions for future interest rates at this stage. You know our overall concept – we do what is necessary to deliver price stability. It is not just a promise; it is a track record, over eleven and a half years. As regards growth, you know that since we started to observe the pick-up in growth four quarters ago (we have had four successive quarters of growth), we have never declared victory. Instead we said: now we are in black figures; it is better, but let us remain cautious and prudent. It is clear that the second quarter has been exceptionally good. And, when I compute growth over the four last quarters in the euro area, I arrive at a figure of 1.9 % growth. This figure is much better than that anticipated a year ago. So, we have had a succession of positive surprises, but as I said we have not declared victory. We consider that we are still in an uncertain universe. We had hard and soft data at the beginning of the third quarter that were also mostly better than expected. All this explains why our staff has revised projections significantly upward in comparison with the June projections, not only for this year, but also for the next, because of the carry-over. Nevertheless, again, the Governing Council must remain cautious and prudent: we do not declare victory. With regard to your second question, I have already said that a double-dip recession was not on the cards. Based on the staff projections I am even more inclined to say that. And, second, regarding the bigger picture, we have just seen some headlines flash up on the European Union plans to limit naked short-selling on stocks and also government debt. In my mind, this was one element that Angela Merkel pushed through in the beginning of this year at the height of the crisis. Do you think this sends out a signal of more fragility in the market in order to calm the markets in general? Where does this fit into the picture, in particular if you also look at the widening spreads that we are seeing between bonds and also countries such as Greece etc.? In answer to your first question, the decision on the liquidity operations was taken by consensus. There was unanimity on the interest rates. As regards the bidding for the three-month LTROs, you have seen that for the last quarter we have confirmed the return to the full allotment procedure. We will see what happens in the future. We took no decision in this domain and we will see when we take the next decision. For now, we have taken the decision for the next four operations, because we have the one at the end of September, and then we have the three three-month LTROs for the last quarter. As regards your second question, I will not comment particularly on short-selling. Second, in the opening statement you mentioned a couple of downside risks, including financial market protectionism and so forth. If those risks were to materialise, what would the ECB be willing to do to help the economy? On your first question, the anchoring of inflation expectations is really exceptionally good. This has always been fundamental for us because it is a major tool for delivering price stability, and all the information we have from surveys and from the markets show that we are going in the right direction. When I said that the Governing Council was of the view that risks are “slightly tilted” to the upside, it was in comparison with the inflation projections themselves which are fully in line with price stability. It was to take into account all eventualities, and not only all the other factors I mentioned in the introductory remarks, but also the indirect taxation increases and administrative price increases that are needed in order to bring the fiscal position back in line. This is the main element that is captured in what we described as a slight tilt to the upside. But again this is in comparison with a baseline that is fully in line with our definition of price stability. On your second question with regard to the overall situation, you know our views. We consider that by ensuring price stability – price stability meaning less than, but close to two percent – we are guarding against inflation and against the possible risk of deflation, which never materialised. I have to say I am very encouraged when I compare developments in the euro area with observations from other economies. We have guarded the euro area from inflation as well as from deflationary risks materialising. This is, for us, the appropriate way to contribute to sustainable growth and sustainable job creation, and of course we will continue to be very attentive in this respect. We never see any contradiction between pursuing our primary mandate and helping to deliver sustainable growth and job creation. Second, you talk about risks to growth being tilted slightly downwards and you mention other major advanced economies – I guess you probably had the United States in mind there. Could you tell us, particularly as you were there at the weekend and talked to Mr Bernanke, what is your assessment of the outlook for the United States? And third, just building on comments you made in your speech in Jackson Hole, you talked about the qualities required of central bankers. I wonder whether you also think a central banker needs to be a diplomat, particularly when it comes to making comments ahead of Council meetings. On the first question as I already said, we are managing the progressive phasing out of the exceptional measures we introduced. The maturity of the last 12-month operation and the maturity of the last six-month operations are two examples of factors that justify the three fine-tuning operations I have mentioned. So we are very aware of the concerns you mentioned in your first remark and consider it to be something which must be taken into account very carefully. It is a process and we are in the course of that process We must also consider that these non-standard measures and their withdrawal, including the full allotment mode, have to be fully commensurate with the situation we see on the markets. As regards your question on the United States, I would say that one has to be careful not to follow a mood which is a little too cyclical. What we see is more or less what we had in mind and we are not too much disappointed because we did not consider extraordinary dynamic growth to be very likely. As for our own situation, you see that we are very anxious not to create abnormal expectations. We have very good results for the last quarter but we do not declare victory. In any case, I very much stick to the analysis of Ben Bernanke and the Federal Open Market Committee on the situation in the United States. They know well what is happening in the US. On your last question, I will only say that there is one Governing Council and I am very happy to be its porte-parole. I would say that, as a citizen, I have been appalled by the remarks, and as President of the ECB, I have full confidence in the Bundesbank’s decisions and the attitude of the Bundesbank’s Board, absolutely full confidence. And the second question I have is that you also called for governments to reduce debt and especially the debt-to-GDP ratio. And you mentioned examples of several European countries which were successful in bringing this ratio to 60% in the 1990s. But at least five of those countries now have the opposite problem. They are highly indebted because they had to rescue the private sector. So, there was simply a debt transfer. So, we are back to square one. But when you call then for far-reaching structural reforms for reaching this target, you do not mean simple corrections, I mean do you think that sectors like the pension sector and the health sector should be fully privatised or something like that? On your first question: I heard what other governors said, particularly Ben Bernanke, and I think we are in full agreement. He explicitly said that it was not a way out to embark on a higher definition of inflation, a higher inflation target and so forth. This was very clear. The disadvantages and the difficulties associated with such a move are very clear. I would say that the central banks are unanimous in considering that some of the suggestions that were made – and we all have in mind these suggestions – were absolutely not acceptable. I have no reservations at all on that matter. As regards your second question on debt reduction, I mentioned the fact that in the past it has proven possible to go from very high levels as a proportion of GDP to sustainable levels. This is the proof that what is at stake for a number of countries today, after the particular difficulty associated with the crisis – namely significant debt reductions as percentages of GDP, it is doable as it is demonstrated by past experience. But of course it calls for determined decisions and action. Secondly, the Irish debt agency has criticised as flawed a Standard & Poor’s analysis which led the rating agency to downgrade its assessment of Ireland’s debt. Do you agree with that assessment that the downgrading is based on a flawed analysis? Thirdly, there is acute political concern in Ireland about the cost of rescuing Anglo Irish Bank, the nationalised lender. The cost of the rescue is now estimated at some 25 billion euro. There are people who say that your policy of not allowing any European bank to close is, in this instance, creating an unbearable level of pressure on Irish taxpayers, on whom the burden of the rescue falls. What do you say to that? And what do you say to people who say that the rescue of this bank is, in fact, undermining the market confidence in the Irish government’s economic plan? As regards your first question I have no particular comment on spreads. I think what we are doing at the level of the Governing Council of the ECB with the Securities Markets Programme has been made absolutely clear, and I would not comment on spreads, just as I do not comment on a day-to-day basis on the level of stocks and shares. As regards your second question on the overall Irish strategy, I would encourage Ireland to continue to take the appropriate decisions, as has been done since the very beginning of the crisis with the “frontloading” of very important decisions in all domains, including in the fiscal domain, which remains a very important one. It is the responsibility of the Irish government and of the Irish authorities in general to deal with their banks. That responsibility lies very much in Dublin. And I have confidence that they will manage this difficult issue as well as possible, as they did in the past. I already responded on this. If I am not mistaken, it is a bank which is owned by the government. So it is the responsibility of the government of Ireland and of the Irish authorities in general to take the appropriate decisions. And second, do you see enough effort being made in non-euro area countries to join the euro area in the future and when can this next step of enlargement take place in your opinion? I have already responded to the first question. We do exactly what we trust is commensurate taken into account the situation of the markets and to cope with the case of abnormal functioning of the markets. As I have already mentioned several times today, we are in the process of phasing these measures out. We took decisions today that speak for themselves. As regards the enlargement of the euro area, you know that at the beginning of next year, a new country will join. We will be seventeen and not sixteen. It is up to the various countries of the European Union, at least those that are committed to entering the euro area, to continue to do what is necessary to converge and to fulfil the criteria, to which we are inflexibly attached. At the present moment, one country made enough efforts to join and I encourage all the others to do likewise. I think the sentiment of the Governing Council is that a clear strategy to move to a sustainable fiscal situation is part of what is necessary to consolidate the recovery. Without that you are not creating the appropriate conditions for sustainable growth and job creation. We firmly believe this. It does not mean that everything can be done immediately, but there has to be a sustainable and credible path to a more sound fiscal policy. That is our message for any country in Europe. And the other question would be, German steel workers have demanded a 6% pay rise, and the question would be is there a danger that euro zone inflation could shoot up if they get anything close to this much? On the first question, this is an issue which is of great importance discussed at the global level, by the Europeans, emerging countries and other industrialised countries. I will not hide the fact that, in my view, it would be very important for the Europeans to be united and to have a clear, united position. At this stage this is a personal view, but one which I would express very strongly. It is part of the appropriate management of the global economy that we make clear what we consider appropriate. As you know, at the present moment there are still various views in Europe. On your second question, as always, we consider it important to maintain appropriate moderation in terms of wages and salaries as long as the country has unemployment and as long as – and each economy has to be analysed very thoroughly – the economy has competitiveness problems. By the way, I would like to make the observation that when I look at the employment and unemployment level, since the beginning of the crisis I see that in most countries unemployment has increased. However, in some economies, at least in two economies in the euro area, unemployment has decreased. And the two countries in question are Germany and Austria. There are a number of reasons for this, but it is not too surprising as these are two countries where moderation of unit labour costs has been exemplary. I don’t want to generalise, or to over-simplify the situation, because it is certainly a multi-dimensional issue. But appropriate wage moderation, taking into account all the elements of the case, is very important to foster employment and sustained job creation. And also in the GDP numbers today for the euro zone, there was quite a significant gap between growth rates in the northern parts of Europe, particularly Germany, but also close to Germany, and southern Europe. Are you afraid that that persistent gap will endanger the recovery in the euro area? On your first question, I would say that we took a lot of decisions, as you can see: we have three fine-tuning operations, we are maintaining the full allotment for the one-week and one-month operations and we embarked on three three-month operations with the average MRO rate. It was a set of decisions. We examine the pros and cons of each decision and, taking everything into account, we had a consensus for this package. On your second question, the so-called heterogeneity or diversity of the euro area, I would comment a little bit on your question, I think it’s important. Very often I am asked “country X is now growing brilliantly, country Y is not, so what are the dilemmas that you have in such a situation” or “unemployment is very high in country A and very satisfactory in country B, so how do you solve this puzzle and the associated difficulties” and so forth. Just to make clear what the Governing Council of the ECB does: we issue the currency for a vast area, for 16 countries (shortly, 17) and for more than 330 million inhabitants. So, our size is of the order of magnitude of the United States. The Federal Reserve also has to issue a currency for a large number of states. So I was anxious to see, after all those remarks, what kind of diversity can be observed on both continents. If I look at yearly average growth in the United States, I see that over the ten years from 1997 to 2007, the slowest yearly growth is 0.9%, and the fastest is 4.7%. 0.9% refers to Ohio on the one hand and 4.7% to Arizona on the other hand, according to the figures I was given. It has to be checked, and as you know I always consider that the Fed is the judge for data in the United States. In the euro area, over an equivalent period of time, the lowest yearly growth would be of the order of magnitude of Ohio and the fastest of the order of magnitude of Arizona. So, you see, we are not in different universes. If I take the present level of unemployment, the lowest would be 3.5% and the highest 14% in the United States today. In our case, the lowest is exactly the same order of magnitude. The highest, I have to say, is higher, but if I take the number two of the highest in the euro area, I have exactly the level of the highest figure in the United States. Such diversity seems to be a normal feature of a very vast economy. Of course, each individual state or nation has its own responsibilities, this is important in the USA and is particularly important in our own case. However, we have to take decisions on the basis of the overall superior interest of 330 million people. All the information that I have indicates that it is moving in the right direction. Of course, a lot of hard work remains to be done in the next few months. I will be soon in Estonia and we will have the opportunity to review everything, but at this moment in time I would say that the preparations seem to be very much on track, and we are satisfied with that. But, as I said, hard work remains to be done by the end of the year. And the second question is regarding the problems in the Deutsche Bundesbank. Many German politicians are putting pressure on Axel Weber to put Mr Sarrazin out of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Are you afraid that the whole thing could cause damage to the independence of the Eurosystem and of the central banks? On the first question, we have always said that we do not consider the interest rate level and the monetary policy stance, on the one hand, and the non-standard measures, on the other hand, to be moving “in sync”. We can have decisions on the standard measures without having the phasing-out of all the non-standard measures, and vice versa. It is, in a way, a separation principle. The non-standard measures are designed to cope with the abnormal functioning of certain markets or market segments, and to permit the appropriate transmission of our monetary policy. Monetary policy is designed to deliver price stability. I have already said how proud I am that we have proved to be able to deliver price stability over time. As regards your second question, as I said already, personally, as a citizen, I am appalled by what I have heard from one particular person. Second, I said that I have full confidence – shared by the ECB Governing Council as a whole – in the Deutsche Bundesbank and its ability to take the appropriate decisions. These decisions are the responsibility of the Deutsche Bundesbank, which is – and this is essential – fiercely independent, like all the national central banks and the ECB. The Maastricht Treaty is crystal clear in this respect. If we had only been considering the end of the year, we would have announced something similar to 2007, being engaged in an enormous “jumbo” fine-tuning operation at year end. What we have announced today, as you can see, comprehends a set of several decisions You have understood very well what I said. We will accompany the normalisation of the market. These measures were established because we had to cope with the abnormal functioning of a number of markets. It is our hope that we will proceed as rapidly as possible with this market normalisation, which should be part of the normalisation of the overall situation. This is more than just a hope: everything that we are doing is aimed at anchoring solidly confidence in the euro area and we are actively trying to normalise all segments of the markets. "
05/08/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council views the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. It therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Considering all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 8 July 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. The available economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in economic activity in the second quarter of 2010, and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected. Looking further ahead, and taking into account a number of temporary factors, we continue to expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of uncertainty. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the Securities Markets Programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. We remain firmly committed to price stability over the medium to longer term. The monetary policy stance and the overall provision of liquidity will be adjusted as appropriate. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. After a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. Euro area real GDP increased, on a quarterly basis, by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010. The available economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in economic activity in the second quarter of 2010 and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected. Looking further ahead, and taking into account temporary effects, the Governing Council continues to expect real GDP to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area. Ongoing growth at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should continue to support the euro area economy. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced in an environment of uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than is now projected, thereby further supporting euro area exports. On the downside, concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.7% in July, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, from 1.4% in June, most likely owing to upward base effects in the energy and food components. In the next few months annual HICP inflation rates are expected to display some further volatility around the current level. Looking further ahead, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate overall, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. Upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Overall, the Governing Council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 turned positive and was 0.2% in June 2010, after -0.1% in May. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased slightly further but, at 0.3%, remained weak. Together, these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. Shorter-term developments in M3 and some of its components and counterparts have remained volatile, and this volatility may well persist. The previously strong impact of the interest rate constellation on monetary dynamics, while still affecting the pace of underlying money growth, appears to be gradually waning. This implies a gradual reduction in the effect on actual M3 growth arising from the downward impact of the steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. At the same time, the annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate, although it remained strong at 9.2% in June 2010. In part, this reflects somewhat higher opportunity costs of holding overnight deposits relative to other short-term deposits. The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments, with increasingly positive growth in loans to households and stabilised negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations. A lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to developments in economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle. The data up to June indicate that, after expanding for a few months earlier in the year, the size of banks’ overall balance sheets has not increased further. The challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In this respect, we welcome the EU-wide stress-testing exercise, which was prepared and conducted by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) and national supervisory authorities, in close cooperation with the ECB. This stress-testing exercise was comprehensive and rigorous, and the results confirm the resilience of EU and euro area banking systems as a whole to severe economic and financial shocks. The stress test has also significantly enhanced transparency regarding the current financial conditions and risk exposures of the 91 institutions that participated in the exercise. Hence, the exercise represents an important step forward in restoring market confidence. We also welcome the commitment made by national authorities with regard to the provision of support facilities for banks where private sector means are insufficient. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Considering all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 8 July 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. The available economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in economic activity in the second quarter of 2010, and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected. Looking further ahead, and taking into account a number of temporary factors, we continue to expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, it is essential that budget plans for 2011 and beyond reflect a strong commitment to returning to sound public finances. Given the exceptional fiscal deterioration over the past two years, there is an urgent need to implement credible medium-term consolidation strategies aimed at restoring fiscal sustainability and creating room for budgetary manoeuvre. As a minimum, countries’ budgetary targets must comply with the fiscal consolidation requirements foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures. More ambitious targets, as already adopted by a number of euro area countries, may become necessary where current plans fall short of meeting the main objective of halting and reversing the increase in the government debt ratio. Moreover, all countries must specify credible fiscal adjustment measures, focusing on the expenditure side, while being prepared to implement additional measures, where needed, over the coming years. In order to support the process of fiscal consolidation, to underpin the proper functioning of the euro area and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth, the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential. Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. Measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness. Reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies. We are now at your disposal for questions. My other question is: when can we expect the ECB to announce whether it intends to resume its exit strategy, because you have only committed to giving unlimited three-month loans at the benchmark rate until the end of September? Are you going to tell us next month whether you intend to extend that or not, particularly against the backdrop of the fact that the Federal Reserve System seems to be becoming more concerned about having to ease monetary policy a bit further? In answer to your first question, I would say that we are, of course, happy that the stress tests were successful. Taking everything into account, including the unlimited supply of liquidity that we continue to practice the present level of liquidity is due to the less dynamic demand by the banks for this liquidity. We therefore have a situation where, in our view, it is normal to see some augmentation in the EONIA interest rate. It is part of the normalisation of the situation. It was not normal to permanently have an enormous amount of excess liquidity in the market. I do not welcome it particularly – it is part of the normalisation of the situation. As regards your second question I do not comment on future rates. The Governing Council considers today the present monetary policy rate to be appropriate and there are no signs at the moment suggesting us to change interest rates. As regards the money market, we see this market functioning a little bit better – the volume of transactions in the overall money market has increased significantly, perhaps even doubled. Therefore, we are not yet in a normal situation, but it is certainly heading in the right direction in terms of activity in the money market. As regards the “non standard” measures, we will meet as usual next month and we will do what we consider appropriate, taking into account all circumstances, as always. Furthermore, given that these purchases do appear to be winding down, I was wondering if you could look back over the last few weeks of this programme and tell us what some of its successes might have been and how you would address the critics, especially in Germany, who have said that there is a longer-term issue here in terms of the ECB’s credibility and its intervention in government securities markets? With regard to your last point, I have to say that I have already addressed the issue on a number of occasions in the various media, and not only in Germany. I have explained what we did and why, namely to help restoring a functioning of our monetary policy transmission. With regard to your first point I would say that we have seen a significant improvement in the overall market situation, which, not surprisingly, has meant that the level of activity in that particular programme has been very meagre. You will remember that we did not say in advance that we will purchase a certain amount – we said that we would act as necessary, taking into account our objective. I am happy that the level of activity in this programme is meagre, because if it weren’t, it would mean that the situation is worse than it is. That being said, however, I am not going to be complacent about the present situation because I know that a lot of challenges lie ahead of us. I would nevertheless draw your attention to the fact that the Governing Council of the ECB is there to ensure steadiness, continuity and a sense of direction. You know better than anyone that our environment can be volatile and it is up to us to provide an anchor not only for price stability, but for the confidence that is so necessary in Europe and also in the world, to the extent that we are an important participant in the global economy. I say this also on behalf of my colleagues who are central bankers and have exactly the same stake in being steady, solid anchors. In this regard, I have to say that I am particularly happy that we have a very strong anchoring of inflation expectations, as it is our primary mandate to deliver price stability. It is remarkable that throughout this recent period –the three, four, five last months– inflation expectations remained very solidly anchored despite the turbulences, as evidenced by the information extracted from the financial markets and the information collected from the various surveys and panels. I will not comment further on this issue. Also I noticed in your introductory statement that you have dropped the word “high” from uncertainty three times and I am wondering whether that means that you are now more confident that the recovery will not be derailed even if there should be further financial market tensions. On the first question, you know that I never comment on the exchange rates, except when I have something to say. And at the present moment I have no particular message. As regards your second question, I am a little bit surprised by your interpretation because I am not sure that we had a particular message on that point. We do consider that we are in an environment of uncertainty. We do consider that we should not be complacent in any respect. Of course, we have had recently good indications, from both hard data and soft data, and we consider that both the second quarter and probably also the third quarter are likely to be better than had been expected. But we are certainly not declaring victory, nor would we say that we are now in a period of active growth. It remains uncertain and it remains uneven, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, and we are in a situation where it is likely that the second semester will be much less buoyant than the second quarter, for which we expect to see flattering figures. Again, I remain prudent – we will see the figures when they come. But on the basis of all the information available, including today, from hard data and soft data, we have a situation which is better than expected. But as you will remember, after the dramatic freefall of the real economy last year, when we observed that we were bouncing back, we did not declare victory. We said that we were happy that we were back to positive figures, but that it remained something which had to be viewed with great caution. And we were right not to declare victory, you might remember, because we then saw that the growth of the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year were very modest. So we have good news, but let us remain prudent and cautious, and let us do all that we can to preserve confidence, to be the anchor of confidence that is so important in the present environment. It is what we have been consistently doing since the beginning of the crisis – since 9 August 2007 – and we will continue to be the necessary anchor of confidence. If, despite the turbulence we have experienced during the last few months and despite the very negative judgements that some participants in the market might have had, wrongly of course, on the euro area and on Europe in general, the euro area prove able to surmount all these difficulties with no major or significant impact on the real economy as a result, I think part of the credit will come to the Governing Council of the ECB and we would be proud of that. And in that context, are you happy or at all concerned that there has been a de facto tightening of monetary policy in the euro area because of the higher market interest rates and the stronger euro, at a time when the Fed is stating that a more accommodative stance is perhaps possible? On your first question, it will not surprise you that, taking into account the level of mutual confidence that we have in the constituency of central banks, I rely very much on the Fed’s judgement of the US economy and the conclusion I draw is that in the United States, as well as in Europe, we have to be aware of the ups and downs in sentiment. Sentiment is sentiment. Reality is reality. We have to look at facts and figures and what is really going on. So, I think that after having been extremely negative about Europe and extremely positive about the United States, we are now observing some kind of swing in the other direction. However, I did say that while we were happy to see better figures for Europe and a level of confidence which is higher than before, we were not declaring victory. In my mind it would be very premature to draw a negative conclusion on the US economy at this moment. We will see what happens. On your second question, I am not sure that we can characterise the situation quite as simply as we said, because on the one hand you have the objective figures that you were implicitly mentioning –the EONIA, the EURIBOR interest rates and also, as regards the external side of the coin, exchange rates. On the other hand, you also have a lot of spreads that have fallen, you have the level of confidence, as I already mentioned, that has increased after having been very low. So, regarding the overall monetary and financial environment of the real economy, I am not sure that you can suggest that it is tighter than was the case before. I would suggest that it could be the contrary, taking into account the confidence channel and the fact that we are now, from that standpoint, in a situation which is obviously better than before. Again, I am not declaring victory. We remain cautious. And second, what did you really learn today from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, especially in terms of looking ahead at the inflation and also the growth forecast, in particular since you were saying that the second semester might perhaps not be as buoyant as the second quarter? Well, again, it is our function to be anchors of stability, also in an environment which is volatile. So I am no more or less alarmed than I was three months ago: we are steady, we always maintain our composure and it is our duty to do so. We demonstrate sang-froid and we have to do this in all circumstances. So the Governing Council took the situation as it was four months ago, three months ago, two months ago, and we take it as it is today. I would say we are reasoning in the medium to long-term. From time to time we really have to tell a number of market participants that they are probably wrong in their immediate assessment, what is the real situation in our view. We keep our composure as much as possible in all circumstances. And this is what everybody expects from us, including our fellow citizens and, of course, the financial market itself. Markets would be totally upside down if they could not rely on solid, steady central banks. And I am not speaking for the ECB particularly, but for the whole constituency of sister institutions. As regards your second question on our forecast at this stage, I would not change in any respect the predictions that we made last time. At our next meeting we will see what our new projections are, but again, I would warn against drawing too hasty conclusions from what we have observed. I believe that we will have a good second quarter and that we will have a third quarter that will probably be better than previously expected. I will stick to that at this stage and I will not draw any conclusions for the period to come. I think that a number of factors have played a role. I think that the success of the stress tests has demonstrated that the Governing Council of the ECB was wise in recommending stress tests, in recommending the publication of the results at the level of individual banks and in recommending as much transparency as possible. We also always recommended that this information should be displayed, at the same time, all over Europe, following the same template. This proved to be a very good way – after all, it had already been experienced in the United States. So, the stress tests played a role, but we are in an environment that is also incorporating a number of other factors on top of the stress tests, such as the elements of the real economy that are better than expected and the decisions that have been taken by a number of countries that go in the right direction, as we had suggested, in terms of resolute fiscal retrenchment and re-establishing their own credibility. It seems to me that it is this very comprehensive set of information that has been captured by the market, and which signals that things are going back to normal progressively. I would not say at all that the discussions that took place in Basel have watered down in any respect future rules and regulations. On the contrary, it seems to me that this was an early judgement, which was wrong, and that there is now a feeling that it is an important step forward. In any case, as you know, we will meet again in September. This meeting will deal with calibration, which is extremely important, as well as how to organise the transition. So, what has been published in Basel is in full accord with what we have said since the very beginning: that we require better quality, quantity and international consistency of capital, that we have to strengthen the liquidity standards and that we have to reduce pro-cyclicality. Nevertheless, very important decisions remain to be taken, as I just said, particularly with regard to the calibration, which is decisive. In any case, I think the industry itself understands pretty well that what is important for us is to be sure that, in the medium term and as a permanent regime, we have a financial system that is resilient. We cannot put ourselves in the situation that we faced in 2008, when the public authorities were obliged to take on a level of taxpayer risk that was absolutely gigantic and very abnormal. This is extremely important, because we have had a recession, which has been very deep, and there has been an enormous price to be paid for the free fall of the real economy. But there is another reason: I do not think that our fellow citizens will twice accept risking 27% of GDP of taxpayers’ money to support the financial system in order to avoid what could have been a great depression. We had a recession, not a depression. And the risk of a depression in the future would remain high if we do not have a financial system which is sufficiently resilient. So, we are very determined to make the system much more resilient. That said organising the transition is something which is natural in the present circumstances. It seems to me that this confirmation that we will have a transition period was understood by the banks as something important. I think that the main message of the party concerned was that insofar as we have not decided on the calibration and on the transition period, we cannot consider that there is already a package that has been decided. Perhaps you could put the question directly to the central bank in question and to the supervisory authority in question, because both the central bank and the supervisory authority were at the meeting in Basel. As you know, the meeting is called the GHoS, meaning Governors and Heads of Supervision. It takes place at the global level with the emerging countries fully present. I have to say, speaking as an active participant that it is remarkable that all these global issues are discussed with the industrialised countries and the emerging countries on exactly the same footing and with a remarkable contribution by the emerging countries themselves. And this is something which is part of the new global governance that we have introduced since the crisis. Regarding the results of the bank lending survey, it seems to me that the period of the survey was not the best period, because it was done between 14 June and 2 July 2010. If you remember the situation at that time, you might imagine that to some extent we have to take into account the period in question. That being said, in the figures for June loans to non-financial corporations over twelve months were at -1.9%, which is a little less negative than in the previous month and up to now seems to us to be in line with historical observations after a recession of the size that we experienced, unfortunately, in the previous year. As regards households, we see that the dynamism of loans to households seems to be confirmed, at 2.8%. The figure was 2.6% in the previous month. And that is also in line with historical observations, so what we see at present is confirmation of historical observations. We are not over-interpreting these results and we should not declare victory, but certainly they do not confirm or suggest that we could have a credit crunch. I do not think that it is at all appropriate to say that. I think it is a challenge that we had to face permanently since the very beginning of the euro. Germany had very flat growth for many years at a time when Ireland was buoyant, so we had exactly the same issue, but in reverse. What is extremely important is to consider that we have to take our decisions taking into account 330 million people – a number of people in the same order of magnitude as the United States. And we have to consider what is in the best interests of all, namely to be sure that all our decisions permit the delivery of price stability – which we have achieved for 11 and a half years – fully in line with our definition of price stability, i.e. inflation of less than, but close to, 2%. And we have achieved this in a better fashion than was the case before the introduction of the euro in the equivalent of the euro area since WWII. We have the best track record over a period of more than 10 years. This is something which is perceived by the market and one of the main reasons why inflation expectations are so well-anchored. That being said, we have different situations. Some countries, like Germany in 1999, had to catch up in terms of their competitiveness, which was insufficient at the time. And I have to say that Germany has done a fantastic job over 10 to 11 years to regain competitiveness. It is remarkable, but it was not achieved by chance, it was achieved because year after year hard work was being done. In other country cases, we have had a level of buoyancy which was abnormal. In such cases, the national authorities have to take their own responsibility. We are responsible for monetary policy; all the other elements of economic policy are in the hands of national authorities, including fiscal policy and also all elements of national policy that can influence the competitiveness of the country, including unit labour costs and all competitiveness indicators. Since the ECB was created, this has been our permanent message to member countries: your monetary policy is a given, you can rely upon the delivery of price stability at the level of the euro area as a whole. Now you have to be fully cognizant of the fact that a lot of economic responsibility rests with the national authorities. That is the way the system functions. That is our permanent message. I never comment on what my colleagues say, because they do not speak on behalf of the Governing Council. I am the porte-parole (spokesperson), and if I am not here it is the Vice-President. That being said, we are never pre-committed, as you know – it’s contrary to our principles. Again, we consider that the present level of interest rates is appropriate. That being said, we will always do what is necessary to deliver price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. It is not by chance that I can say now that over 11 and a half years we have delivered price stability. It is a remarkable track record, but as you might remember – we took decisions in 2004, we took tough decisions in December 2005 – which infuriated a large number of our counterparts; and we even took decisions in 2008, in July, which was also during a period of turbulence, which proved that we were not taking our responsibility of delivering price stability lightly. At the moment we consider the 1% rate to be appropriate. We can – and we will always – do what is necessary to deliver price stability. And we have proved that it’s not an empty promise. I was speaking of the real economy of the euro area. I said that if it appears, ex post – which has yet to be proved – that we have been able to pass through this difficult period without the real economy being very significantly, negatively influenced, which was the working assumption of a large number of observers, then perhaps part of the credit could come to the central bank. I said only part of the credit, in any case. I will, very fortunately, like all my colleagues, from time to time have a little rest. And my usual place to rest is the small and beautiful city of Saint-Malo in Brittany. I said that I would compare the second half of the year with the second quarter, which we expect to be dynamic. I don’t think we should over-interpret that. It is true that we expect the two last quarters of the second half of the year to be significantly less dynamic than the second quarter, because the second quarter seems to be really exceptional. But I would not elaborate more on that. Again, the main message is: we remain cautious and prudent. We consider that we undoubtedly have a recovery; the double-dip is very fortunately totally out of the question, in our opinion, for the present moment. But, again, growth is likely to remain uneven and relatively modest. We are very prudent, cautious and modest. I would say that I have been central bank governor for approximately 17 years. It is not a job where you have no criticism. It is one of the jobs where you have the most criticism, which I consider normal. We are living in very vivid democracies with public opinion debate which is very vivid and, coming from a country which is legendary for its capacity to engage in criticism, I had formidable training in my own country! As a matter of fact there has been an “optical illusion” in the level of capital, because a number of banks had been recapitalised immediately before the stress tests. So, when you look at what had been done in terms of recapitalisation in Europe, you see that the results of the stress tests are not at all indicative of what has really been done. Immediately before, I am speaking of figures under your control, Vítor; we had something like €15 billion that had been already done for recapitalisation. And a very important amount of recapitalisation had been done in the year before the stress tests. So when we make comparisons with the United States we have to take into account the fact that our own stress tests came after massive recapitalisation, whereas the US stress tests came before the massive recapitalisation. That makes a difference. And the market has understood that pretty well, it seems to me. As regards the recapitalisation and elements that could permit the banks to reinforce their balance sheets, we are very clear on that. We are encouraging all possible means for the commercial banks to reinforce their balance sheets. This is not new; the Governing Council did not wait for the stress tests to say: “Take advantage of issuing stocks and shares in the market. Put retained earnings at a level which would permit commercial banks to reinforce their balance sheets. Why don’t you embark on taking advantage, when necessary, of the public facilities that exist?” And by the way the public facilities still exist, as you know, because a large part of the option for recapitalisation which had been decided by the various governments in Europe is still unused, and so we still have in this respect an important level of backstop facilities that might be important. I see that there is absolutely no question on Greece, which I appreciate enormously. I guess it is because you have already read the communiqué of the IMF, of the Commission and of the ECB. And I think this is something which is part of the overall picture. This does not mean that very hard work should not continue to be done, of course, but it is something which is again, as I said, part of the overall picture. "
08/07/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council views the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. It therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 10 June 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of high uncertainty. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the Securities Markets Programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. We remain firmly committed to price stability over the medium to longer term. The monetary policy stance and the overall provision of liquidity will be adjusted as appropriate. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. After a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. Euro area real GDP increased, on a quarterly basis, by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010, according to Eurostat’s second estimate. The latest economic data and survey-based indicators suggest that a strengthening in economic activity took place during the spring. The Governing Council expects real GDP to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area. The ongoing recovery at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should provide support to the euro area economy. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced, in an environment of high uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected, thereby further supporting euro area exports. On the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in financial markets, with possible further adverse effects on financing conditions and confidence. In addition, a stronger or more protracted than previously expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances, may weigh on the downside. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in June, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.6% in May. In the next few months annual HICP inflation rates are expected to display some further volatility, with a tendency towards somewhat higher rates later in the year. Looking ahead, in 2011 inflation rates should overall remain moderate, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. Upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Overall, the Governing Council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was unchanged at -0.2% in May 2010. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased slightly further but, at 0.2%, remained weak. Together, these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. Shorter-term developments in M3 and some of its components and counterparts have remained volatile and, given the continued tensions in some financial market segments, this volatility may well persist. The previously strong impact of the interest rate constellation on monetary dynamics appears to be gradually waning. This implies that actual M3 growth is less affected than before by the downward impact of the steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. Moreover, the impact that the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments have on shifts within M3 towards M1 should be diminishing. However, at 10.3%, annual M1 growth is still very strong. The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments, with positive growth in loans to households and negative growth in loans to non-financial corporations. While the monthly flow in bank loans to non-financial corporations was positive in May, in the light of the volatility observed in recent months it is too early to judge whether this signals a turning point. A lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to developments in economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle. The data up to May confirm that the size of banks’ overall balance sheets has increased since the turn of the year. The challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In this respect, we welcome the decision announced by the European Council to publish, with the consent of the banks involved, the individual results of the stress test exercise for banks in the European Union carried out by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) in cooperation with the ECB. Appropriate action will have to be taken where needed. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 10 June 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of high uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. As regards fiscal policies, the focus clearly needs to be on ensuring the sustainability of public finances. In the current environment, all euro area countries must, as a minimum, comply with their fiscal consolidation plans as foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures. More ambitious targets, as already adopted by a number of countries, may become necessary where current plans fall short of meeting the main objective of halting and reversing the increase in the government debt ratio. Moreover, all countries must specify credible adjustment measures that are sufficient to attain their budgetary targets for 2010, 2011 and beyond, and must live up to their commitment to take additional measures, where needed, over the coming years. For the proper functioning of the euro area, and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth, the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential. This will also support the process of fiscal consolidation. Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. Measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness. Reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Let me finally refer to the proposals submitted by the Governing Council to the Task Force on Economic Governance established by the European Council under the chairmanship of President Van Rompuy. In the view of the Governing Council, a quantum leap in terms of progress towards strengthening the institutional foundations of EMU is needed. It is essential that governance and enforcement structures in the economic policy framework of the euro area be strengthened. Reinforcing surveillance of national budgetary policies and ensuring rigorous compliance with the fiscal rules will be key. Furthermore, it is extremely important that close oversight of relative competitiveness developments be implemented and that a surveillance mechanism be established to address imbalances in the euro area countries. At the same time, it is important to establish an appropriate euro area crisis management framework that minimises moral hazard. We are now at your disposal for questions. My second question is: were there any calls today to suspend the ECB’s bond purchases? Or at least calls to set a date when the programme will expire? Or could you imagine expanding the programme, buying also, for instance, commercial paper? On your first question, I will only remind you of some figures. You remember that we had on 1 July the end of the one-year refinancing operation, which involved an enormous amount of liquidity, 442 billion euro. It has been replaced by the three-month tender of 132 billion euro, and by the six-day operation of 111 billion euro, that we had organised in order to facilitate this transition. The two together, 132 plus 111, amounts to 243. 442 minus 243 equal 199. So there has been a withdrawal of liquidity of 199 billion euro at that moment. The day before yesterday, we had the previous main refinancing operation which was falling due, and we had the six-day operation of the previous week falling due, and that represented 163 plus 111, which makes 274. And we had the new main refinancing operation amounting to 229. So, the difference between the two was an additional withdrawal of 45 billion euro of liquidity. 199 plus 45 equals 244 billion euro of liquidity that has been withdrawn, all taken together. We knew that we would have this phenomenon taking into account the enormous maturity which was falling due. So, I only draw your attention to that. It is not necessarily surprising that you have some observations on the behaviour of the market. It would reflect the fact that we are in such a situation of liquidity withdrawal. But it was the will of the banks, because they had an unlimited supply of liquidity in all those operations. I wanted to give you the figures that are behind what is being observed in the market. I have no other comment on that point. I would say that we are still in a mode of unlimited supply of liquidity, for the one-week main refinancing operation, and the one-month and three-month operations. We already took the decision, as you may remember, to have several successive three-month operations in that mode. As regards your second question on the Securities Markets Programme, I can only say that we are examining the situation. We did not change in any respect the purpose of the programme. Because you are observing what we are doing every week, you see the amount of the operations under this programme. And we have the feeling that what is needed in terms of the level of interventions from us has been progressively diminishing, but we will continue to observe this with great attention. Again, we are continuing to monitor the programme very carefully. And in terms of the stress test for the banks, the ECB and many of the national central banks are very much for the publication of the stress test; from your point of view, what will it do for us, what can it do for the market? On the first point, I would say again that we are observing the situation carefully. I think it is not untrue to observe that there is a tendency for the secondary market to function a little bit better, but I think it is too early to draw a definitive conclusion. What is clear is that for reasons that are complex, it seems to me that a lot of important new information – for instance all the positive decisions that have been taken, the fact that the various countries concerned have changed and improved their fiscal policies in comparison with what existed some months ago, in some cases some weeks ago, and the fact that a number of very important decisions have been taken by the European executive branches and by institutions such as the IMF – is being progressively captured and incorporated by market participants, investors and savers in their own analysis. Not surprisingly so, particularly taking into account that many of these decisions were considered extremely difficult to take, even impossible or extremely unlikely. So, again, the fact that investors, savers and market participants are progressively incorporating this new information into their own decisions is something which seems natural. It seems to me that we are observing this phenomenon. Again it is an ongoing phenomenon and I remain prudent and cautious. But what I always thought and the Governing Council thought was that some of the market analysts, investors and savers were much too pessimistic about the ability of the Europeans to take the appropriate decisions, whether at the level of the various governments as regards their own policies or at the level of Europe as a whole, the 27, as well as the 16. On the stress tests, I would confirm that the ECB has been calling for the stress test to be as well-conducted as possible, not only at the level of macro stress tests, as had been envisaged since a long period of time, but also at the level of individual banks. We were very happy when the European Council decided that it would be done at the level of individual banks. As you may remember, the important decisions were taken at the level of the ECOFIN Council on 2 December 2009. So it is an old story. It started in December 2009 at least at the level of this decision of the ECOFIN. It was on 17 June that the European Council asked for the publication. We consider it very important that it has been decided to publish the results at the level of individual banks and we are following that very carefully. As you know, the stress tests are being finalised by the national supervisors and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) in close cooperation with the ECB, and the Vice-President has been extraordinarily active in this cooperation with CEBS over the last days and weeks. And also, just a small detail related to that, you say that the results will be detailed on an individual bank level. Will we get full details of every single bank? As regards your first point, if and when there is a mobilisation of the stabilisation fund, we will see exactly what is decided by the authorities concerned and what would be eligible for such financing. I cannot say anything more on that at this stage. We have been convinced since the very beginning that transparency has its virtue and that it is good that the market, European investors and savers and all market participants can see what the results of those tests are. Therefore on the contrary, we think that it is confidence-building. As regards your second point, I already mentioned the European Council’s important decision to publish the results at the level of individual commercial banks and not at the level of macro tests only. The details of that are in the hands of CEBS and will of course be made public in due time. Second on the stress test: There still seems to be quite a lot of confusion about exactly what scenarios will be tested with regard to sovereign debt. As you have said, the ECB has proposed the scenarios against which the banks will be tested. Can you tell us what the ECB has recommended in terms of sovereign debt? What scenarios should the banks be tested against? On your first point, it would be a complete mistake to interpret what we are observing on the market as a monetary policy signal. It is not the case at all. As far as we understand, it is the consequence of the decision of the banks themselves at the moment of the renewal of their previous financing to ask for less than they could have done. The new supplies of liquidity that I have mentioned, the three-month operation and the main refinancing operation, were unlimited. So the banks would have got any amount of liquidity they asked for. We had absolutely no intention ourselves; we are observing that with great care and attention. No monetary policy signal! On the second point, I would stick, with the agreement of the Vice-President, to what has been made public until now. The macroeconomic scenarios include a set of key macroeconomic variables differentiated for the EU Member States, the rest of the EEA countries and the United States. The exercise also envisages adverse conditions in financial markets and a shock on interest rates to capture an increase in risk premia linked to deterioration in the EU government bond markets. This will all be made public at the appropriate time. At this stage we have nothing to add. My second question is a broader one. Yesterday in Berlin, there was a press conference by the four famous professors who have brought the constitutional challenge against the financial bail-out of Greece. They have now expanded their challenge to the whole financial safety net. You can no longer ignore their propositions because opinion polls in Germany say that the majority of the population support them. And if you read the text, it is full of arguments which, from a constitutional law perspective, make a lot of sense. Do you think that these initiatives are sticking to old concepts of law – constitutional law – and that we have now new forms of international law which these people do not want to take into account?. On your second point, I have no particular comment. These are procedures that are ongoing and I will not comment on them. You know our position. And what has been done by the executive branches and the other institutions, is legal and correct and appropriate, in the circumstances. We expressed our opinion publicly on that because we were asked to make a statement by the various governments concerned. On your first point, I have nothing to add to what I have said before. And second, the IMF said today that markets are not yet convinced of the ECB’s commitment to scaling up bond purchases if this is necessary to prevent a further deterioration of market functioning? What is your opinion on that? On the first point, let me just repeat what I have already said. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital basis or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. On the second point, my own observation is that the market sees what has been done by governments and what is new and was not incorporated in the previous reaction of some market participants, but was carried out by the European executive branches as mentioned in the previous question. Market participants see what we ourselves have done. There are elements that are justifying the tendency for these secondary markets to function better. But again I remain cautious and prudent. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely. For all other questions on the stress tests – we will not say anything more than what we have already said and what has been made public by the authorities. For further information, you will have to wait until 23 July, when you will have the stress tests, the assumptions and the results. Then you will make your judgment and, of course, we expect that all observers will have an opinion on this. As I already said, it was not necessarily surprising that the tender you are referring to was a little bit difficult because we were withdrawing, not €51 billion as originally planned, but €199 billion all in one go. It was an enormous withdrawal of liquidity. I was satisfied that the last operation functioned correctly, given the enormous scale of the previous withdrawal. It is, of course, our intention to continue with the sterilisation, and this is being done through the appropriate means. And we will take the appropriate decisions to continue to sterilise these interventions. And my second question is: the Bank for International Settlements has proposed that official budget forecasts be prepared or verified by independent agencies. So, what role do you see for the ECB in this, if any? On the first point, as I have said, we have already decided to continue to proceed with the three-month operations to supply unlimited liquidity for a number of months to come. There was no new decision. On the second question, I will not comment on the BIS remarks but, as you know, in our own proposal made to the Van Rompuy task force, we mentioned explicitly that we thought that it would be good to have an independent institution, preferably within the Commission, that would make an assessment and diagnosis of the fiscal situation of the various countries that are members of the EU and the euro area. No. As you know, we did not mention that in our proposal, and I do not think it would be opportune. And, related to that, the second question would be whether you see a link between your securities programme and the full operationality of the stabilisation fund by the governments? If this thing really works, would this be for the ECB an opportunity to withdraw from its own programme? On your first question, as you remember we decided that both the six-month and the one-year operation would be phased out, and that the three-month operation would be made with variable rate tenders. We decided – taking into account the situation of the market and the overall environment of the banks – that it was appropriate to go back to the unlimited supply of liquidity for the three-month operation. At this stage, we consider that it is the appropriate way of taking into account, through non-standard measures, the situation as it is. We continue to observe the situation carefully, but for the present moment it seems to us appropriate. Don’t forget that we have to do what is necessary - exactly what is necessary, no more than what is necessary – in the circumstances. It was an important decision to reactivate this full allotment mode, at a time when we had started the exit for some of the non-conventional measures, particularly the three-month operation I have just mentioned. On your second question, we will see exactly how the stabilisation fund is managed. I think it is very important that it exists, because it is a very powerful deterrent in terms of its volume. It is one of those important decisions that I would categorise as being completely unexpected ex-ante by observers, investors, savers and market participants. Now, it remains to be seen exactly how this stabilisation fund is used in practice. I would call for flexibility in the utilisation of the fund. I think it is something which would certainly be optimum, but it is not our decision, it is the decision of the governments concerned. And a second question just on the economic outlook. There are signs that the US economy is perhaps slowing, that China may be slowing and, in an environment of budget deficit reduction in Europe, do you have any concerns that the European economy could fall back into recession? On your first question, I would say it’s an observation. You might remember the first settlement week we had to withdraw liquidity at a level of €16.5 billion, the second settlement week €10 billion, the third €8.5 billion and then we went down to €5.5 billion. For the last operation we had €4 billion. You will see what happens next Monday. It is something which looks like a trend, but we remain alert. We observe what is going on, and we are not surprised that the market is a little bit better because, as I have already said, decisions that are unexpected are progressively incorporated; they take a little time to be incorporated by market participants, investors and savers. On your second question we remain cautious and prudent. We place great emphasis on the uncertainty which characterises the present period, not only at our level but also at a global level. You mentioned some observations in other big economies: you mentioned the United States, you mentioned China. Taking into account the fact that there is perhaps the feeling that the euro area in particular, and Europe in general, is in a less favourable situation, I would draw your attention to the following: the second quarter in the euro area is likely to be significantly better than the first quarter. That is something which has been confirmed by a variety of data, not only soft data but also hard data. The figures for industrial production, for industrial new orders, that we saw in the most recent monthly data were very good. I can see also that the most recent information – received even today – on an important economy of the euro area, namely Germany, on industrial output was also good. And I have noted myself that, in some observations made by financial institutions, the positive “surprises” regarding the euro area economy were important in comparison with certain other economies, where good results were expected but where the results, when made public, were a little less flattering. So, I see perhaps a tendency, not on our part – because we remain very cautious and very prudent – but outside the euro area, to be first excessively pessimistic about us, and to see that the figures we have do not confirm this pessimism. I am not changing in any respect the last forecast by our own staff, and the last IMF projections are in line with what we are saying. We are in a situation where a number of facts, figures and data do not confirm that we could have stagnation or a double-dip recession. It is not what we are observing at this stage. I could mention other figures, but I do not want to overburden you. You know the figures, and I have to say that part of the sentiment which is a little bit better might come from these facts that I have just mentioned. And, second, you reiterated the point that in the stress tests banks should take advantage of the government funds that are available, but are you concerned that the governments may not make them available? And what would be the risk to the markets or outlook in that case? I have already responded to your first question. There is no interpretation in terms of monetary policy signal of what we have observed in the money market. I have given you the figures on what the banks themselves asked for. If the banks had asked for more, we would probably have a lower level of market rates. This is a phenomenon that is not signalling monetary policy intentions at this stage. On your second point, we have mentioned what was, in the eyes of the Governing Council, the appropriate way to respond to a possible need to increase capital and, of course, we expect all parties concerned, including governments and public authorities, to take that into account when the stress tests are published. And the second one, maybe to ease the atmosphere: on Sunday two countries of the euro area will try to win their first football world cup – this is good news. Given the fact that the winning country can hope for a boost to its domestic economy, do you have a secret favourite for this final, and was it an issue even in an informal form during the session of the Governing Council? I will take your second question first. I have said from time to time that one should not underestimate Europe. In soccer, in particular, it is quite impressive to see the number of European teams that were in the best sixteen and the best eight. In the best four there are three European teams – all from the euro area, by the way! No, I cannot say that I have any preference. I would only say may the best team win. I am sure that we will see a marvellous play, as we saw in the last match, which was also very beautiful. I have no opinion on the result of the match. The last match was a beautiful match and the two teams were very beautiful on the field – at least in the eyes of all those with whom I watched it yesterday evening. I am not a soccer enthusiast myself. Perhaps I am too impressed by the beauty of the play because I cannot really make pertinent comparison. On your first question on the stress tests, I do not know whether, implicitly, the banks that are talking to you are suggesting that the stress tests should be much tougher – not only to stress test the risks that have already been identified, but all the very many risks that have not been identified. I do not think that is an appropriate way to characterise what we are doing. As has been done in the past on the other side of the Atlantic, in particular, we are trying to identify the risk themselves and to gain a proper understanding of extreme cases where there is severe deterioration in the situation. And the second question, you have promised to publish new collateral rules for private debt this month. Are we going to get them today or will that suspense continue? On the first question, we will not mix the two programmes; the two programmes are of a different nature. We explained very clearly what the purpose of the covered bond purchase programme was, which is totally different from the purpose we had in mind when we embarked on the Securities Markets Programme. So, we don’t confuse the two, not at all. On your second question, what has been decided will be published in due course. As mentioned in our press release of 8 April the specific haircut schedules will be published in the course of July. But it is not something that we have examined today. "
10/06/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Constâncio, the new Vice-President of the ECB, and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 6 May 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Global inflationary pressures may persist, while domestic price pressures are expected to remain low. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010, but quarterly growth rates are likely to be rather uneven. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace, in an environment of continued tensions in some financial market segments and of unusually high uncertainty. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of strong financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the Securities Markets Programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. We remain firmly committed to price stability over the medium to longer term, and the monetary policy stance and the overall provision of liquidity will be adjusted as appropriate. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. After a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, euro area real GDP increased, on a quarterly basis, by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010. While adverse weather conditions, in particular, dampened growth in the early part of the year, the latest economic indicators suggest that a rebound took place during the spring. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects real GDP to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area. The ongoing recovery at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should provide support to the euro area economy. However, the recovery of activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and weak labour market prospects. This assessment is also reflected in the June 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real GDP growth will range between 0.7% and 1.3% in 2010 and between 0.2% and 2.2% in 2011. Compared with the March 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the range for real GDP growth this year has been revised slightly upwards, owing to the positive impact of stronger activity worldwide in the short run, while the range has been revised somewhat downwards for 2011, reflecting mainly domestic demand prospects. The June 2010 Eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced, in an environment of unusually high uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected, thereby further supporting euro area exports. On the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments and related confidence effects. In addition, a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances, may weigh on the downside. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in May 2010, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.5% in April. The rise in inflation over recent months mostly reflects higher energy prices. During the second half of this year some further slight increases in HICP inflation cannot be excluded. Looking further ahead, inflation rates should overall remain moderate. Upward pressures on commodity prices may persist, while euro area domestic price pressures are expected to remain low. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This assessment is also reflected in the June 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 1.4% and 1.6% for 2010 and between 1.0% and 2.2% for 2011. Compared with the ECB staff projections of March 2010, the ranges have been adjusted somewhat upwards, mainly reflecting higher euro prices for commodities. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. Upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Overall, the Governing Council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was unchanged at -0.1% in April 2010. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased somewhat further and turned positive, but remained weak at 0.1%. Together, these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. Shorter-term developments in M3 and loans have remained volatile and, given the renewed tensions in some financial market segments, volatility in M3 and its components may well continue. The actual growth in M3 continues to understate the underlying pace of monetary expansion, but the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds to longer-term deposits and securities outside M3 appear to be gradually waning. The same holds for the shifts within M3 that have been observed as a response to the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments. At 10.7%, annual M1 growth is still very strong. The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector conceals the fact that monthly flows have now been positive for a number of months. At the same time, these aggregate developments continue to reflect mainly an ongoing strengthening in the annual growth of loans to households, while the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained negative. A lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle. The latest data confirm that the reduction in the size of banks’ overall balance sheets has not continued since the turn of the year. However, further adjustments cannot be ruled out and the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. To address this challenge, banks should turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 6 May 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Global inflationary pressures may persist, while domestic price pressures are expected to remain low. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010, but quarterly growth rates are likely to be rather uneven. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace, in an environment of continued tensions in some financial market segments and of unusually high uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. As regards fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the recent decision by euro area countries to formally establish a European Financial Stability Facility. This needs to be accompanied by decisive action at the level of governments. It is essential that all countries stick to their commitments to correct high budget deficits and government debt and reduce fiscal vulnerability. To this end, the concrete adjustment measures needed to achieve the budgetary targets should be fully specified. All countries must ensure that confidence in the sustainability of public finances is guaranteed. The Governing Council welcomes the fact that a number of euro area governments with the highest deficits and strongly increasing debt levels have adopted additional fiscal consolidation measures and set out more ambitious fiscal targets. In this context, we took note of the spring 2010 orientations for fiscal policies in euro area countries agreed by the euro area finance ministers on 7 June, and welcome the commitment to take additional measures, where needed, in order to ensure the achievement of the budgetary targets for 2010 and beyond. It is indeed key that the new budgetary targets be achieved. The Governing Council fully agrees with the ministers on the priority of halting and reversing the increase in the debt ratio and welcomes the commitment to take immediate action to that effect. For all euro area countries, structural reforms leading to higher growth and employment are crucial to support a sustainable recovery. Existing competitiveness problems, as well as domestic and external imbalances, need to be urgently addressed by the countries concerned. To that end, wage-bargaining should allow wages to adjust appropriately to the competitiveness and unemployment situation. Likewise, measures that increase price flexibility and non-price competitiveness are essential. Finally, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. First, on the bond purchasing programme: what changed your mind about it? Last time in Lisbon you said you did not even discuss it in the Council, and after that, a couple of days later we heard about this bond purchasing programme. What prompted you to do it? And how do you view it now in its necessity and effectiveness? Secondly, there are enormous amounts of money parked yet again. We had this a couple of years ago at the ECB and the deposit facilities which are clogging up the banking system, how concerned are you by this that the banks yet again do not start lending to each other and hence possibly hamper the economy? And lastly, Jean-Claude Juncker said in Luxembourg this week with a degree of exasperation: “I wish politicians did not talk too much and I wish central bankers did not talk so much”. Hearing what we hear sometimes from other ECB Governing Council members as a concert, would you sometimes wish that central bankers would not talk so much? You are very privileged. You asked three questions. I warn you all in advance; the other journalists will have just two as a maximum! As regards your first question as you know, I have had a number of occasions to explain why we embarked on the Securities Markets Programme, not only in the communiqué and also in speeches and interviews, but I repeat the reason. The Securities Markets Programme is designed to ensure the effective functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism by helping to resolve a malfunctioning of some segments of the euro area debt securities market. This malfunctioning became very acute in the afternoon of the Thursday following our Governing Council meeting on 6 May and during all of Friday, 7 May. This was not only observed by us, by market participants or by financial institutions in Europe, it was observed the world over as a major event that was threatening the functioning not only of the European economy and market but also of the global financial markets and the global economy. And that is the reason why, as you know, not only were a number of decisions taken by us and by others, but there was also international support through a communiqué of the G7 and a communiqué of the G20. A second important element of this decision was that we did not change the monetary policy stance, just as we have not changed the monetary policy stance today. We considered that the monetary policy stance had to remain unchanged, that it was appropriate. We confirmed that in our decision of 9 May; it was communicated on 10 May. We said very clearly that we would withdraw all the liquidity that was to be supplied through this Securities Markets Programme, and you have been able to observe this withdrawal of liquidity functioning week after week. Of course, in taking that decision, we had taken note – as was said immediately and repeated during all the communication which was undertaken – of the commitment of euro area governments. I quote the statement of the Heads of State and Government in which they agreed “… to take all measures needed to meet fiscal targets this year and the years ahead”. They also made a solemn statement saying that each one of them was ready – and again I am quoting – “… to take the necessary measures to accelerate fiscal consolidation”. This is my third point: Finally, I would say that as far as we are concerned, as you heard me say a moment ago, we are inflexibly attached to price stability. We have the best track record on price stability over 11½ years that you can find in Europe – including among the legacy currencies – since the Second World War. You also know how proud I am, together with all the members of the Governing Council, that our inflation expectations are exceptionally well-anchored in comparison with all comparable currencies and comparable economies. So this is something which is of the utmost importance. On your second question, I would say that clearly we are in a period where we have an unlimited supply of liquidity in particular through the one-month window and the main refinancing operations. You will remember that we also took additional decisions on the occasion of our set of decisions of 9 May. We see clearly that there is an illustration of these tensions that I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council as regards the demand for liquidity and of course in what we are observing in our deposit facility. It means that we have a money market which is not functioning perfectly. That is clear. And on your last point, I would only say that there is one currency, there is one ECB, there is one Governing Council. And because we have to take decisions on the basis of, among other things, this credible alertness which characterises our institution, there is always only one decision. And I would add that there is only one Governing Council explanation, which I am very proud to give you. And my second question would be: are you going to issue debt certificates to mop up liquidity from the system? On your first question, as you know, we are withdrawing the liquidity that we are injecting, and each week you can see what we are doing. We don’t give any additional information. But you could see that the first week we withdrew approximately 16.5 billion euros, the second week 10 billion more, the third week an additional 8.5 billion, in the fourth week 5.5 billion. So you have this information. We withdraw exactly the level of liquidity that we inject. No other indication. As regards your second question, we are looking at all possible instruments, but there is absolutely nothing immediate in this domain. And secondly, do the estimates for growth and inflation take into account the austerity measures ‑ are they built into the forecasts? On your first question: again, there is one decision, one institution, one currency ‑ and I already responded to a similar question. We are pursuing the exact objective that I mentioned earlier. We are not changing the monetary policy stance and we are helping to restore the appropriate functioning of a number of markets that were disrupted, and that were hampering the monetary policy transmission. As regards your second question on our own projections, these are the projections of the staff of the Eurosystem. As I said, in comparison with the projections that were made by the ECB staff three months ago ‑ because we are alternating between ECB and Eurosystem staff every three months ‑ there is a little bit more growth this year, and a little less next year. All things considered, if you take the two years, we have approximately the same level: the difference is 0.1%. Why do we have this difference? It is complex, because it is totally multi-dimensional and all new information is incorporated. It is our understanding that, after having had a first quarter that was not buoyant we will have a much more buoyant second quarter. And that explains the fact that for the full year we might have this revision up, which is not totally negligible, because it is plus 0.2%. We do not see similar changes in the profile for next year, and, all things considered, including the profile and the carry-over, we have this slight revision down. But what is important in what we say is the level of uncertainty: we clearly are both as regards our own economy and as regards a large number of other industrialised economies, in a situation which remains uncertain. Growth is not something that is already written somewhere and that is imposed on us: growth depends on us, and, crucially, in our opinion, depends on confidence. We try to continue to be an anchor of confidence ourselves. Our fellow citizens can have confidence in our capacity to deliver price stability and defend their purchasing power. These are not just words ‑ look at our track record of 11½ years, which is fully in line with our definition of price stability. It is extremely important, that all institutions, authorities and entities ‑ public and private ‑ do all what they can to improve confidence, as we already called upon them to do. And also, once these loans are being paid back, do you expect banks to compensate for that by the upcoming three-month tender or do you expect the liquidity conditions to tighten significantly? Let me only say that, when we say “as appropriate”, we really mean “according to the market situation” and with the inflexible needle in our compass aimed at delivering price stability, which – again – is our major asset. In all circumstances, also when we face major difficulties, I believe it to have been extremely important that the anchoring of inflation expectations could work against inflation, but also – in the period we experienced after the collapse of Lehman Brothers – against the materialisation of inflationary risks. So, a solid anchoring is something that is absolutely of the essence for us. Now that having been said let me tell you that the Governing Council decided today to adopt a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment in the regular three-month longer-term refinancing operations to be allotted on 28 July, 25 August and 29 September 2010, i.e. for a full quarter. So, this is a decision taken by the Governing Council today. It is a response also to your second question, it seems to me. And secondly, is the Bank concerned about inflation in the new EU countries? On your first question, again we consider our current interest rates to be appropriate taking into account all the information we have gathered. And in conclusion, as I have said, on the basis of both our economic analysis and our monetary analysis – after cross-checking both analyses –we have a monetary policy stance and interest rates that are, in our view, appropriate. That having been said, as you know, we are never pre-committed and we always do what is necessary to deliver price stability. And, again, we have a track record that speaks by itself. As regards your second question on the new EU countries: you are aware of the requirements of Europe, of what is required of all of us. We are all devoted to price stability. This is in the Treaty, which is valid for all 27 countries. But it is the responsibility of the central banks, which have to be devoted to ensuring price stability for the various nations, to fulfil their obligations within the framework of the European Union as a whole. As far as we are concerned, we are following very carefully what is happening in the central and eastern European countries, as well as in the international community as a whole. And it is important that we are all united in purpose, because we are all dependent on global features, on the global economy and global inflation, in particular. Secondly, perhaps you could give us a flavour also of the discussion on the extension of the three-month unlimited offers. Was that agreed unanimously? I know some people talked about returning to an exit strategy in July. But perhaps you could tell us about the flavour of that? And on the euro, is the lower euro another reason why growth is higher this year in your forecasts? As regards your first question I have said what was the purpose and the design of the Securities Markets Programme that we have embarked on, and you can observe yourselves what we do in terms of weekly operations and weekly withdrawal of liquidity. I will only say that we continue to have the same role as regards the programme. As regards your second question on the three-month operations, we were unanimous in taking that decision. As regards your third question on the exchange rate of the euro with the US dollar or vis-à-vis other currencies, I will only say that the euro is a very credible currency, with an exceptional track record in preserving price stability, and that this capacity to preserve its value over time in an very credible way is a major asset for domestic and external investors. I know your position because you expressed it last time, and I have already said that one can defend that position. This is a debate that has been going on in the United States for a very long period of time. The position of the ECB, which you reflected very well, is that this is not something that we consider urgent or even appropriate in our present situation. But I do not deny that you are entitled to your opinion. You have your opinion, we have ours. And the second one is: Would the ECB go on buying bonds of euro countries when there would be a clear threat of a sovereign default? Again, what we have done and what we are doing, with the same purpose, is to permit, or to help restore, an appropriate functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. And we consider, at the moment I am speaking, that it is appropriate to continue to do what we decided previously. I am not giving any information other than that. We are sticking to the decisions we have taken, which have the same purpose as they had when they were made. And I should repeat the very important message that we are withdrawing all the liquidity that is injected in order to fully preserve the monetary policy stance, which we considered should not be changed and which we have again today considered does not need any change. The stance is appropriate and, moreover, as you know, inflation expectations are solidly anchored, which is essential. As regards your second question I have no further comments to make. We are doing what we have decided to do. I am and we all are, I have to say, supporting stronger governance, stronger governance at the level of the 27 and at the level of the 16. … within the EU and within the euro area, both. And I think that what we are observing at the present moment is a clear demonstration that first, rigorous implementation of what already exists – the Stability and Growth Pact, in particular – is absolutely of the essence. As you know, that has always been our position and we have been inflexible on that position. We have, unfortunately, had to fight against opposing views. And, most unfortunately, we have seen how the spirit of the Pact has been weakened, even if the letter of the Pact has been saved against attempts to dismantle it. Also, as we the Governing Council have always said, we must not only apply rigorously the Stability and Growth Pact, in all its fiscal aspects, but also follow, very carefully, unit labour costs and competitiveness indicators inside the euro area, as well as monitoring structural reforms. All this is relevant to the very sizeable and far ranging work that has been started, having been decided upon by the governments, under the presidency of Mr. van Rompuy. And it is extremely important that we make a quantum leap in this domain, in Europe as a whole, but particularly in the euro area. We share the same currency – a single currency – and we share a common destiny. We have to improve drastically the governance of the euro area member states. We will be more explicit on that when we transmit our own proposal, but it would mean improving massively the ex-ante monitoring of the position of the various governments. For instance, in the fiscal area, we are very strongly in favour of the European semester. And I trust now that practically all countries – even those who were resisting – are now on board. We need more effective sanctions. We need much more effective monitoring of what is happening, with the quasi-automaticity of sanctions and of the capacity to impose appropriate behaviour on countries that would behave improperly. This is across the board and I would say a first step would be to exploit all the possibilities that the secondary legislation of Europe permits in all domains. And we consider that we have to go up to the limit of what the legal framework permits. Again, it is absolutely of the essence and what we are experiencing today and have been experiencing for a number of months is a wake-up call in this respect. And a second question is: what could be done from the side of the ECB or other sides just to avoid systemic risks from Spain to the European markets? As regards your first question we rely on the Spanish banks very much. We rely very much on the Bank of Spain, which is a member of the Eurosystem, has the responsibility for banking surveillance and is very active in exercising its mandate. The Bank of Spain has always been impressive in this respect. They invented dynamic provisioning, which is considered one of the best concepts globally, and we support the Bank of Spain in all its present efforts. On your second point, as regards banks in general, and not only the Spanish banks, you can see what we have said in our own introductory statements, but it is not new. We have been saying for years and with a lot of strength that they have to improve their own balance sheets, they have to take every opportunity to put aside their earnings in order to reinforce their capital, and they have to be very cautious as regards remuneration. We also said that they have to embark on issuance of new shares and stocks when possible, and to have recourse to governments and to the recapitalisation options that were established in the past and are still necessary in a number of cases. That is very clear. And I would say we are treating all countries in the same way and we call on all countries – not just Spain – to be very keen themselves in putting their house in order. One of these reports, if I understand correctly, has been written by the central bank itself. So, the central bank itself says that it can improve. This is the case for all of us and I would certainly not say that the Banco de España cannot improve. So do not consider that I am giving good marks and bad marks. We are all – the Eurosystem as a whole – learning all appropriate lessons from what has happened. In any case, the improvement of banking surveillance is a global problem. Not just a European problem or a national problem, but a global problem. And as you know, we are all working very actively to improve prudential rules and regulations at the global level. But I understand that these reports are specifically on the lessons to be learned from the events that have very unfortunately been observed in Ireland – as they have in a number of other countries. It would be difficult for me to say that “Patrick is criticising himself, but he is wrong in criticising” – well, not himself, but what has been done in the past. In any case, lessons have to be learned. And to embark on personalisation doesn’t exactly seem appropriate to me. Again, we have to improve the system, which proves – it’s true – that it was not sufficiently resilient. And if I can use the two question facility, I am from Portugal, and I would like to hear the new Vice-President: when you say that the prospects are for moderate growth in Europe, does it take into account the facts of the austerity measures that are being put in place in different countries? On your first question, I must confess that I did not see what President van Rompuy said, so I am very cautious. I do not like to comment on declarations or text that I have not read. So, at this stage I would only say that we called on governments to assume their responsibilities in a situation which was and is very demanding. I said that we welcomed the signing of the document that started to give flesh to this decision taken by the Heads of State and Government on 10 May. At this stage I would say that what is important is that this facility is alive and active, as a result of the very strong determination of all governments concerned, which I was able to observe myself. I was, I have to say, impressed by the rapidity with which the facility was ratified and obtained parliamentary approval. At this stage I have no other comment. I will read very carefully President van Rompuy’s declaration. Constâncio: As regards your second question, we take into consideration – as does anyone trying to forecast what will happen to our economies in the near future – what will be the effects of fiscal measures in order to reduce deficits in all countries. And there we have to distinguish between the short-term effects and the medium- and long-term effects. It is, in a way, unavoidable that in the short-term those measures can have a restrictive effect on the economy. But we have in the first place to compare that with the alternative of doing nothing and what could happen to the fiscal situation of those countries that would lead in a few years’ time to programmes that would have to be much harsher, much stricter, with all the consequences that that would have. Secondly, if we take the medium- and long-term view – and I stressed that several times when I was in Portugal, calling for measures to consolidate our public finances – we also have to consider that if economic agents in general can feel more confident that in the near medium-term future the public finance situation will be better, that will have a positive effect on expectations and can help also on a medium-term basis to create the conditions for faster growth. And second, I understand you stepped in and bought government bonds because we were on the eve of a financial crisis and governments would not have the means to provide the funds in time. But now we will have a vehicle that will provide the funds from the fiscal side, from the governments, and it is actually their job to do that. Would it not then be the right time to get out of the programme, when the vehicle is in place? On the first question, I would say that we are living in market economies and it is clear that when markets – not only government bond markets, but securities markets – are totally disrupted, the monetary policy transmission mechanism does not function. That is obvious. It does not mean that it is easy to help restore the appropriate functioning of the mechanism, but at least you can immediately observe that it is not functioning normally. The monetary policy impulses are totally blurred in this environment. As regards your second question, I will not comment on the future. I said that we had a very clear target, which was not to change the monetary policy stance and to help restore the appropriate functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. And the second question is about bank stress tests. What is shown in the preliminary results, which I believe you have seen by now, and do they show that there is any improvement in the ability of banks to carry risks at this point? As regards your first question I have already responded on the issue of the foreign exchange market. The euro is credible, keeps its value and is a major asset for external and domestic investors. I have no other comment. As regards your second question on the stress tests, this is a process which is being carried out at the level of the CEBS and at this stage we should let the process operate. We will see what exactly they do and what we do. But it is a process which has started through the CEBS and on the basis of parameters that have been discussed between the Commission and the ECB. Question The use of the dollar funding facility has been very low. Would you favour perhaps narrowing the swaps spread in order to make that facility more attractive? No, it is not something that we envisage at this stage. This back-stop facility exists. It is not necessarily utilised, but I would say that it is good that it exists. If it is not utilised, that is also good because that means that there was no need for it. I would say that we have no particular intentions as regards the margin. Well, we will call upon all of them to fulfil their responsibilities. What is extremely important is to improve the understanding of the market, of the environment at stake in the various banks. And we are encouraging them to do whatever is necessary to improve the sentiment of the market because that is the real issue today. That said we are working actively with supervisors on this at the current stage. "
06/05/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Lisbon. I would like to thank Governor Constâncio for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of this meeting. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all new information since our meeting on 8 April 2010, we expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. Global inflationary pressures – driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fast-growing economic regions of the world – are still being counteracted by low domestic price pressures. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. We expect the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, but growth patterns could be uneven in an environment of high uncertainty. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is necessary to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009, after a period of sharp decline. Notably, the economy has benefited from the ongoing recovery in the world economy, the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system. Recent economic data – including positive survey indicators – support the view that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing in 2010. While adverse weather conditions, in particular, dampened growth in the early part of the year, some strengthening appears to be taking place during the spring. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects real GDP to expand at a moderate pace. The ongoing recovery at the global level, and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, should provide support to the euro area economy. At the same time, the financial crisis is expected to have a dampening effect on economic growth given the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation of low capacity utilisation and weak labour market prospects. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced, in an environment of high uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected and confidence may improve more than expected, with the result that the recovery becomes self-sustained. On the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments. In addition, a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and the intensification of protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances, may weigh on the downside. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in April 2010, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.4% in March. This is somewhat higher than expected a few months ago and appears to be related, in particular, to upward pressure in energy prices. Looking ahead, global inflationary pressures may increase, driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fast-growing economic regions of the world, while euro area domestic price pressures are still expected to remain contained. As a result, overall inflation rates are expected to be moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In the near term, given the developments in energy prices, risks to earlier projections for HICP inflation are tilted somewhat towards the upside, while risks to price stability over the medium term are viewed as still remaining broadly balanced. Upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Overall, we need to monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 remained slightly negative, at -0.1%, in March 2010. Together with the continued negative annual growth in loans to the private sector – -0.2% in March – the latest data further support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that the inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. Shorter-term developments in M3 and loans have also remained muted. The actual growth in M3 is seen as weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion, as the rather steep yield curve continues to foster the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. At the same time, the still narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments imply low opportunity costs of allocating funds to overnight deposits rather than other M3 instruments. This is reflected in the continued marked difference between weak annual growth in M3 and strong annual growth in M1, which was 10.9% in March. However, with the current interest rate constellation already in place for some time, the latest data suggest that the large shifts in the allocations of funds are waning. The annual growth of bank loans to the private sector remained negative in March, but this conceals a further positive monthly flow. It also conceals ongoing opposite developments at the sectoral level, with positive, increasing annual growth in loans to households on the one side, and negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other side. While the lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle, the data over the past few months point to a possible discontinuation of the earlier downward trend in annual loan growth. The latest data also confirm that the reduction in the size of banks’ overall balance sheets has not continued since the turn of the year. However, further adjustments cannot be ruled out and the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. To address this challenge, banks should turn to the market and use present funding conditions to strengthen further their capital bases. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all new information since our meeting on 8 April 2010, we expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. Global inflationary pressures – driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fast-growing economic regions of the world – are still being counteracted by low domestic price pressures. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. We expect the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, but growth patterns could be uneven in an environment of high uncertainty. A cross- check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is necessary to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. As regards fiscal policies, we call for decisive actions by governments to achieve a lasting and credible consolidation of public finances. The latest information shows that the correction of the large fiscal imbalances will, in general, require a stepping-up of current efforts. Fiscal consolidation will need to exceed substantially the annual structural adjustment of 0.5% of GDP set as a minimum requirement by the Stability and Growth Pact. The longer the fiscal correction is postponed, the greater the adjustment needs become and the higher the risk of reputational and confidence losses. Instead, the swift implementation of frontloaded and comprehensive consolidation plans, focusing on the expenditure side and combined with structural reforms, will strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to regain sustainability of public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term. In this context, the Governing Council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was approved by the Greek government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund, with a view to safeguarding financial stability in the euro area as a whole. For all euro area countries, structural reforms leading to higher growth and employment are crucial to support a sustainable recovery. In view of the recent rise in unemployment, tax and benefit systems that set effective incentives to work, improved training schemes and sufficient flexibility in labour contracts are required in order to avoid an increase in structural unemployment. At the same time, existing competitiveness problems, as well as domestic and external imbalances, need to be urgently addressed by the countries concerned. To that end, wage-bargaining institutions that allow wages to adjust appropriately to losses in competitiveness and the unemployment situation are indispensable. Likewise, measures that increase price flexibility and non-price competitiveness are essential. Finally, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. The first one is: is the purchase of government bonds an option to fight the consequences of Greece’s fiscal crisis on financial markets? Did you discuss this option today? The second one is: does the European Union, in your opinion, need an orderly default procedure for its member countries? And the third one would be: why did you decide to suspend the rating requirement for Greek government bonds alone? Would it not have been more of a signal to say: “We accept all government bonds from all member countries, full stop”? On your first question, we did not discuss this option. On the second question, we did not discuss anything like default or such a default procedure at all. On the contrary, as you know, we are firmly of the view that Greece, which is the country that I quoted in my introductory remarks, will not default. And I will come to Greece now because it’s the third question. The position of the Governing Council is as follows. There are three major reasons that enlightened the Governing Council when, last Sunday, we took the decision on the Greek government bonds’ eligibility. The first consideration is that we had ourselves called very strongly for Greece to embark on a recovery programme; an adjustment programme which would be very ambitious. I myself made the point very strongly on behalf of the Governing Council in the meeting of the Heads of State and Government that took place in February. As a consequence of this recommendation, we had a recovery programme; an adjustment programme, which has been negotiated. We were part of these negotiations because the Governing Council had accepted that we would be in liaison with the European Commission, and we had several experts on the spot in Athens to follow up and be very alert in these negotiations. You might remember that Jürgen Stark also went to Athens with Commissioner Olli Rehn to follow what was going on in terms of the recovery programme. That is a very important point. Second important point: we had been called to make a judgement as a fully independent institution on the quality of the programme that had been negotiated by the European Commission in liaison with us and by the IMF. The Governing Council decided that this recovery programme was appropriate, and I conveyed this positive Governing Council judgement on the multi-year recovery programme of Greece to the governments of Europe – they had asked for our independent assessment, we made this assessment and it was conveyed to the governments of the euro area as early as during the Eurogroup meeting also last Sunday. Third point: we were also asked by the Heads of State and Government, to make an independent judgement on whether or not it was appropriate for them to activate the bilateral loans that they envisaged. Their own decision would be taken only on the basis of our independent judgement, as well as that of the European Commission. And, taking into full consideration the situation of the recovery programme of Greece, the Governing Council decided that it would indeed tell the governments that there was a case for activating the bilateral loans that, together with the IMF contribution, would finance the multi-year recovery programme. It is on the basis of these three points that we considered that we were ourselves sufficiently aware of the recovery programme of Greece and determined to approve this recovery programme. We had to be consistent with this judgement as regards the eligibility of the Greek government bonds. Again, we took these decisions on the very same day, which was last Sunday, and, as you know, it was of course made public last Monday. That is the response to your third question. Second question: has the ECB recently made margin calls on the declining value of euro area sovereign bond collateral? If not, which bonds have been included and excluded, and what would be your plan going forward? And, finally, has saving the euro area become the prime target for the ECB, trumping even ensuring price stability? On the sovereign bonds, I have already said that we did not discuss the point. On your second point, I would say that we permanently review what we are doing, but at the present moment we are applying what we have decided as regards our rules. On the third point, this is a very important one: we are inflexibly attached to price stability. It is our primary mandate. It is what the people of Europe have asked of us. And we are credible in this respect. I have already told you that, at the end of the year, depending, of course, on ultimate adjustments, we will post average inflation over the first 12 years of the euro at a level which will be below, but close to, 2 per cent, i.e. exactly in line with the definition of price stability we gave twelve years ago. This is a remarkable result, not only because we did what we had said we would do – in this domain, as in all others, as you know, what counts are facts and figures – and demonstrated capacity to ensure price stability; it is also remarkable because, with this record, we would be in a better price stability situation than what has been observed in any particular country in the euro area in either the 1990s or 1980s, not to mention the 1970s, which everybody knows was a period of very high inflation. So this is a remarkable demonstration of our inflexible attachment to price stability in the euro area. And when we had to cope with the start of the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008, you remember that we always had a sense of direction; we took a number of non-conventional measures which never hampered the anchoring of inflation expectations. It is what we do now and will continue to do with great determination. And secondly, just on the orderly default process which has been suggested by some politicians in Germany: you mentioned that was not discussed by the Governing Council today but what is your view on the necessity for an orderly default process for a sovereign state in the single currency zone? On your last question, I think that default is out of the question. It is as simple as that. As regards your first question, I never comment on what colleagues say. I will simply repeat that we did not discuss the matter and I have nothing further to say. And then also could you envisage a situation where you expand this special arrangement to other euro area nations that might be in need? And third, could you please tell us whether the EU tranches of aid to Greece will have seniority over the existing debt? And if there is no seniority, how will you explain it because in the end it is taxpayers’ money and should not this deserve to have seniority? On the first question, we were unanimous in asking Greece to embark on a recovery programme. We were unanimous in forming a positive judgement on the recovery programme that has been negotiated by the European Commission, in liaison with us, and by the IMF. We were unanimous in making the judgement –which I communicated, on behalf of the Governing Council, to the governments of the euro area – that there was a case for activating the loans which, together with the IMF, would finance the programme. We had a very important discussion on how to be consistent with these three unanimous decisions in the present circumstances and whether or not we had a better understanding, taking all that into account, or rating agencies had a better understanding of what the situation was in Greece. An overwhelming majority was of the opinion that we had to take the decision that was taken last Sunday, in order to be fully consistent. I think your last point is a question for the governments. They are making the loans, not us. They have to decide exactly what they will do. To my knowledge, the IMF has a general privilege of seniority which is part of the overall global institutional framework. That is my understanding, but it is up to governments, of course, to respond to this question. I have only said that we had three major unanimous decisions by the Governing Council that explain the decision that we took on Sunday. This is specific to Greece, of course. I am referring only to Greece. I am explaining the decision only on Greece. We have had absolutely no involvement in any other cases in which the ECB has itself negotiated the recovery programme, made a judgement on the recovery programme, and told the Heads of State or Government that they themselves had to invest in the form of bilateral loans. So I think it is sufficiently clear. And secondly the euro has come under pressure in the last few weeks. Are you at all worried that it is becoming a disorderly decline? On your first point, you heard what we said and I think it is worth going back a little bit. As I said, the ECB has always been inflexibly attached to price stability and to the solid anchoring of inflation expectations. And we have proved this with better results than any other results over previous decades. So that is very important. We have always said that there were two sides of the coin of EMU: the “E” and the “M”. We are responsible for the “M” and we do our own work as well as possible, and I am speaking of course on behalf of the whole Governing Council. Then there is the “E”, which is the economic union. And the “E” calls for a Stability and Growth Pact that would be fully respected, in letter and spirit. In 2004 we defended the Stability and Growth Pact against successive attacks. We defended it very fiercely. And you might remember that the President of the Commission of the time was saying that it was a stupid pact. And you might also remember that several Heads of State and Government of the time, in particular the Chancellor of Germany and the President of the French Republic, were calling for it to be scrapped. We defended it with extreme determination as it is, as I said, one of the two crucial sides of the coin of EMU. And we are constantly calling for the implementation of the Pact with great determination. And you heard what I said a moment ago on behalf of the Governing Council as regards fiscal policies and structural policies, and the monitoring of relative competitiveness. This is essential. This recommendation is addressed to all countries concerned. My second question is: how strong do you think the contagion risks are for countries like Portugal, Spain and Ireland, and why do you think the UK is not a focus of investors right now? And my final question is: will you change the normalisation of the liquidity provision to banks and did you discuss reintroducing some of the measures you have already suspended in the past months? I have already responded to your first question. Again, our message for all euro area member countries is the same and all of them should recognise what is, for them, the exact implementation of the recommendation that we are making. On the last point, we considered that the improvement we are observing on the market fully justified the progressive and gradual phasing-out of our non-conventional measures. These non-conventional measures are still there, as you know, in particular for the one-week main refinancing operations and for the one-month operations. That is absolutely clear. We have there a full allotment, fixed rate supply of liquidity. As regards the three-month operation where we re-introduced the variable rate tender, I will only say that it is not our intention at all that the result of this tender would put the interest rate significantly higher than 1%. To be frank, we are aiming for it to remain close or very close to 1%. That is the intention of the Governing Council at the moment. And the second question: The 5% interest rate on the loans to Greece – do you think it is feasible for the Greek government to pay that interest rate? On your first question, I would say that it is an open question – not only in Europe, but also in the rest of the world – as to whether or not we have the optimal configuration with its present constellation of rating agencies. In this domain, as in many others, it is perhaps a case of “the more competition, the better”. But I myself will not pronounce on that and I have no Governing Council position to report on the precise question of whether or not we are calling for a European rating agency. In any case, it seems to me that it is something which should be examined, again, not only in the European context, but also at the global level. As regards your second question, this is a decision for governments. All the governments concerned have examined the case very carefully. It is their decision. And I would say that this is part of the adjustment programme, which we ourselves have judged to be positive and worthy of being financed, as I have already said two or three times. Greece and Portugal are not in the same boat, and this is very clear when you look at the facts and figures. Facts and figures are essential. Portugal is one of the 15 other economies and countries in Europe to which the messages I have signalled are addressed. And as I have said we expect all countries to carry out the necessary adjustments and recovery programmes upfront and take the appropriate decisions. But again, Portugal is not Greece. That is absolutely obvious when you look at the figures I would say that we have observed since the very establishment of the euro that the various economies have not been growing at the same speed. That is clear and it has been the case since 1999. Also now we are observing that there are such differences between the various countries. We are looking at the euro area as a whole – the 330 million people of the euro area. And it is of course up to the various authorities in each country to take into account the fact that they have the privilege of belonging to a vast single market with a single currency and to take the appropriate decisions, taking into account their own situation. I mentioned in my introductory remarks that we consider that, taking everything into account, we are currently seeing confirmation of the recovery in the euro area, even if growth may be uneven. That being said, it is also true that we have had some recent soft data that were quite encouraging. And even today, we have had additional national figures, for instance, which were unexpectedly good. So again, let’s remain prudent and cautious, but we have very recently had some news that was better than expected. That does not mean that the first quarter of this year will be flattering. We know that the first quarter will not be flattering at all, in particular because of the weather conditions. And if it is, what are you doing to do against that if there is no plan for a European rating agency. Are you advocating perhaps this competence to judge about sovereign state as you did in fact? We are pursuing a very deep analysis at the global level. The issue of whether or not we have pro-cyclical factors that are adverse in terms of financial stability in the behaviour of rating agencies, whether we have conflicts of interest and so forth, is part of the discussion in the G20, is part of the discussion at the level of the Financial Stability Board. It is work in progress. The problem is not particularly for us, it is a global issue and we have to give global responses. This is one of the areas where we can see that there are elements of pro-cyclicality that have to be fully elucidated. We are working at this stage in Europe and at the global level on what could be the best possible avenues. I do not want to prejudge the results of this discussion. The second question is, would the euro zone actually have the money to help Portugal and Spain, as it has been done for Greece? And finally, you are calling it a recovery plan, but the markets seem to see it as an austerity plan. And you are totally confident that it will succeed, but signals we have been receiving from the markets this week show some scepticism. What in your view explains this difference of perception in what is happening in the crisis at this point? On your first question, I would say we are looking very carefully at every situation and I would not qualify our attitude as anything but being permanently alert and monitoring the situation. As regards the second question, I said already that Portugal is not Greece; I would say Spain is not Greece. I would only say that all countries, not particularly those countries, but all countries have to do their job – which is, simplified: to be on a path that would inspire confidence in the medium-term sustainability of their fiscal position vis-à-vis their own households. That is essential for growth because the confidence of households in terms of consumption and investment is essential for the recovery. In turn, the confidence of enterprises having a fiscal environment, which is sustainable and stable in the medium and long term is also essential for growth. And of course it is essential for external observers and investors. On the last point, I would say I have a unanimous Governing Council – after negotiating with the IMF and with the European Commission. So that is as clear as that. There is a programme which is very serious in our view. This will also be implemented and followed up on a quarterly basis. We will be extremely alert to follow up the implementation of the programme together with the European Commission and of course it will be done also by the IMF on a quarterly basis. That is the reason why we consider that, we could recommend – and it was a very important decision for us to take – to the governments that they could step in and invest in the form of bilateral loans in the recovery of Greece. I do not think that there is any such sentiment in the Governing Council. We consider – and, to my knowledge, it is also the sentiment of all Heads of State or Government who I know – that belonging to the euro area has brought an enormous number of advantages, as we have always said. Of course, it also calls for responsible attitudes as regards the three major areas that we have already mentioned, namely fiscal policies, which are a national responsibility, structural reforms, which are also very largely a national responsibility, and, although this is an oversimplification, the appropriate monitoring of unit labour costs. And a second question related to that perhaps: throughout the last three years you have always emphasised how the ECB is able to react flexibly with speed to fast changing circumstances. I wonder whether that still applies in the current situation where we obviously have escalating financial market tensions related to fiscal problems within the euro area. Do you regard the ECB as remaining as flexible and as responsive as ever or are you simply leaving it up to governments to do their job? On the first point, this gradual and progressive phasing-out of the non-conventional measures has been kept permanently under review by us – and, of course, with a view to observing market developments very carefully. So do not over interpret the fact that we have not mentioned this particular point in the communiqué. We had a number of other points that were in the communiqué, so you could say that we had to make some room for the new points. Second, regarding the remarkable capacity of the Governing Council of the ECB to take decisions that are not usual and to do that rapidly, I can illustrate that in the case of Greece, with the three elements that I have mentioned, namely the fact that we called for an additional, major recovery programme, the fact that we were involved and made a judgement ourselves on this programme, and the fact that we confirmed to governments that in our opinion they should step in. This is something that is not at all usual. We have never done something like that before and we decided to do so, taking into account the circumstances, in a very swift manner, including the decision we took last Sunday. So, yes indeed, the Governing Council of the ECB is maintaining the same line, which is to be permanently alert and able to take the appropriate decisions, even if they are non-conventional. We have a sense of direction, we know where we are going and we will never put in jeopardy the anchoring of inflation expectations and the delivery of price stability, which is our major asset and which is very strongly demanded by the people of Europe. That being said, yes, we ask each institution and each authority to take responsibility. I have been saying that for many months. Each institution has to take its own decisions commensurate with its own responsibility and I have called strongly for the Eurogroup to take responsibility. We cannot substitute for the governments. The governments have their decisions to take while we have our own role as an independent central bank, and of course we expect each authority to fulfil its own responsibilities. I would entirely agree with you. It is clear that we need a much stricter implementation of the letter and the spirit of the framework that exists for fiscal policy. It is indispensable. I expect that it will be discussed by the Task Force of President Van Rompuy. I really trust that it is one of the major points. But remember that we were a little bit isolated in 2004 in our defence of the Stability and Growth Pact – we were not numerous. Of course, today one could consider that we have been vindicated in this defence. I never comment, as you know, on the exchange rate on a day-to-day basis. All I will say is that the euro is a good store of value. As I already said, over the last 12 years we have maintained price stability in an exemplary manner. And for the rest, I will stick to the language agreed with the major authorities of the big floating global currencies. I already responded to this question. On this occasion let me say that I will miss Lucas Papademos enormously, but it is not yet time to say that. He has been a fantastic Vice-President and I will, of course, welcome the new Vice-President, Vítor Constâncio, the remarks of whom and the wisdom of whom we have appreciated enormously in the Governing Council of the ECB. The ECB Governing Council is a very strongly united team, where each of us is convinced that he or she can benefit a lot from the wisdom and viewpoints of the others, and we complement each other well. After all Europe is made up of all of us, and we need to hear all sensitivities, all viewpoints, all wisdom. And let me say now that, a moment ago, I read a letter which, I understand, has been published today, and I see that two heads of states and governments say “we are fully attached to preserving the solidity, stability and unity of the euro area”. I can say that I could also sign that myself! "
08/04/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 March 2010, price developments are expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment of uncertainty, with the growth pattern possibly being uneven owing to a number of special factors. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Benefiting from the ongoing recovery in the world economy, the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system, the euro area economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2009, after a period of sharp decline, while in the fourth quarter real GDP was flat, according to Eurostat’s second release. Available indicators, in particular further positive information from business surveys, suggest that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010, although it may have been affected by a number of special factors, including adverse weather conditions. As a consequence, euro area real GDP growth is likely to have remained uneven around the turn of the year, making it advisable to look through the quarterly volatility and to compare growth developments on a half-yearly basis. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects real GDP growth to continue to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, owing to the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation that low capacity utilisation is likely to dampen investment and that consumption is being hampered by weak labour market prospects. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced, in an environment of uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected and confidence may improve more than expected. Furthermore, there may be greater than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. On the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments, a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and the intensification of protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in March 2010, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 0.9% in February. While no breakdown of overall HICP developments is available yet, this higher than expected outcome may be related in particular to the energy component as well as food prices, possibly partly as a result of weather conditions. Inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon In line with a slow recovery in domestic and foreign demand, overall price, cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to further developments in economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was -0.4% in February. Annual growth in loans to the private sector also remained weak, at -0.4%, despite a positive flow in the month. Overall, the latest data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that, in the medium term, the inflationary pressures associated with monetary developments are low. The growth of M3 and loans is likely to remain weak also in the coming months. The continued steep yield curve fosters the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3 and implies that actual M3 growth is weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion. At the same time, the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments imply low opportunity costs of holding funds in the most liquid components included in M1, which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 10.9% in February. However, the monthly flows in the components of M3 were generally small in February, suggesting that the strong impact of the prevailing interest rate constellation may be progressively waning. The negative annual growth of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments: positive, strengthening annual growth in loans to households on the one hand, and negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other hand. At the same time, the flow of loans to firms in February was positive for the first time since August 2009 and halted the decline in the annual growth rate. Such positive short-term developments need to be assessed with caution, owing to the volatility in monthly data. In addition, it is a normal feature of the business cycle that loans to non-financial corporations remain weak for some time after economic activity has picked up. The reduction in the size of banks’ overall balance sheets appears to have come to a halt in the early months of 2010. However, the challenge remains for them to manage possible further adjustments while at the same time ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. To address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further, and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 March 2010, price developments are expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment of uncertainty, with the growth pattern possibly being uneven owing to a number of special factors. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, it is now essential that governments reduce budget imbalances and correct excessive deficits by the agreed deadlines. In a number of euro area countries, fiscal consolidation will start this year and in all others corrective measures will need to be in place by 2011 at the latest. Fiscal consolidation will need to exceed substantially the annual structural adjustment of 0.5% of GDP set as a minimum requirement by the Stability and Growth Pact, and there is a need to fully define and implement credible fiscal adjustment strategies. This requires determined efforts, notably on the part of countries with high government deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios, not least in view of the expected rising budgetary costs associated with an ageing population. A strong focus on expenditure reforms is needed. The Governing Council welcomes the statement on Greece made by the Heads of State and Government of the euro area countries on 25 March. We fully support the intention to strengthen surveillance of economic and budgetary risks and the instruments for their prevention as well as the excessive deficit procedure. We also welcome the decision to work on a robust crisis resolution framework. Progress in these fields should aim to support the sustainability of public finances and promote the smooth functioning of EMU. Regarding structural reforms, the agreements reached at the European Council on 25 and 26 March on the Europe 2020 strategy should help to reinforce job creation, competitiveness and sustainable growth. To this end, policies should now focus on increasing competition, while sectoral support schemes implemented during the crisis should be phased out. In labour markets, sufficient wage flexibility and a reinforcement of incentives to work are required, in order to avoid higher structural unemployment over the coming years. In the same vein, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector remains essential. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. Regarding our collateral framework, the Governing Council has decided to keep the minimum credit threshold for marketable and non-marketable assets in the Eurosystem collateral framework at investment-grade level (i.e. BBB-/Baa3) beyond the end of 2010, except in the case of asset-backed securities (ABSs). In addition, the Governing Council has decided to apply, as of 1 January 2011, a schedule of graduated valuation haircuts to the assets rated in the BBB+ to BBB- range (or equivalent). This graduated haircut schedule will replace the uniform haircut add-on of 5% that is currently applied to these assets. The detailed haircut schedule will be based on a number of parameters which are specified in the press release to be published after today’s press conference. We are now at your disposal for questions. Secondly, in terms of where we stand on Greece, it seems that the markets do not believe there is a rescue package because the market spreads are still widening. Where do you stand on this? Do you believe in the rescue package? And is the market panic, let us say, unjustified? On your first question, the position of the ECB has always been that we want the governments of the euro area to live up to their responsibility. They are members of the Eurogroup, they have to apply the Stability and Growth Pact and, as I have always said, their countries share a common destiny. That was our main message – live up to your responsibility and, in particular, to the responsibility that you have to impose conditionality to member countries when and where necessary. I never said myself, and neither have my colleagues, that the IMF did not have very good expertise. We collaborate with the IMF, as you know. When Jürgen Stark was in Athens with Commissioner Rehn, the IMF was there as well. So it is not a question of rejecting the IMF. It is a question of having the governments of the euro area live up to their responsibility. And that is the reason why I myself said on behalf of the Governing Council a moment ago that we approved the statement made by the Heads of State and Government on 25 March 2010 in Brussels. As regards your second question on the statement of the Heads of State and Government I would like to say that I consider it to be a workable statement that would – in case it is needed – make it possible to have joint efforts – which are not subsidies, but loans without any element of subsidisation. It would, with the appropriate conditionality, permit financing to be provided, if necessary. And another question on the changes to the collateral framework, initially your announcement of these changes was understood as a support measure for Greece, but lately people have turned around and said, well, actually this is putting a burden on banks that are exposed to Greek assets, to Greek government bonds, because they actually have to shoulder higher haircuts going forward. So how will you make sure that the new haircut system will not interfere with banks being able to refinance? On the first point, I would only say that, as I said a moment ago, the statement of the Heads of State and Government is, in the opinion of the ECB, a workable framework. I will not comment on whether the market itself understands clearly what has been said. But in any case, nobody should take lightly a statement, which has been signed by all Heads of State and Government of the euro area. The way I see it myself, as President of the ECB, is that it is a very serious commitment. That having been said, you should not forget that what is very important is that the programme of the new additional measures that has been decided by Greece is implemented. We have said that this set of new measures is convincing, and that it must be implemented rigorously. That is absolutely key! And thus far I have no reason to believe that it is not being implemented rigorously. But we will remain alert. On the collateral, let me only say that the press communiqué you will receive in few minutes makes clear that “no changes will be made to the current haircut schedule foreseen for central government debt instruments that are rated in the above-mentioned range”, namely BBB range that I have mentioned. After having examined the situation this is the position that has been taken by the ECB’s Governing Council. We look very carefully at the situation from that standpoint and, annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations was still negative in February, at -2.5%. I am very cautious and I do not draw any definitive conclusions at this stage, but the monthly flow in February was positive and we view this as a signal that perhaps the situation may now be a little more favourable. As regards loans to households, they recorded positive growth in February, at 1.8%. Growth in loans for house purchase, for instance, was 2.1%. We have always observed after a recession – and we have had a very big and very sharp recession in Europe as well as in the rest of the world – that loans to households start to recover earlier than loans to non-financial corporations. So what we have observed has – up till now – been in line with what we observed previously. That being said, we have a strong message for commercial banks: we are telling them that they have to do their job, which is to finance the real economy, and we are asking them to take all appropriate measures to permit them to do their job. And that is something which we at the ECB consider extremely important. We have taken measures that were traditional and conventional as well as non-traditional and non-conventional measures. These are now progressively being phased out, but it was not for the sake of pleasing the banks, it was for the sake of financing the real economy. Second, to simply turn this around, can you, in your position, as of now categorically rule out a Greek default? First of all, I do not comment myself on spreads or on the evolution of the market, and I take it that your remarks are an observation of what is going on. I will only repeat that what counts, what is important, is, first, the adjustment measures that are taken and implemented by the Greek government and the Greek parliament and, second, the accord that has been reached at the level of the Heads of State and Government. As for us, we are responsible for 330 million fellow citizens and for 100% of the GDP of the euro area; Greece represents around 2.5% of the GDP of the euro area. But it is presently an important issue. I was present at the meeting of the Heads of State and Government and I had messages for them. I consider that what they have agreed upon is very important. As regards your second point, I would say that based on all the information that I have, default is not an issue for Greece. Could you be more precise? I cannot comment because I didn’t read that. I would only say that as regards the ECB position there is only one Governing Council and one President, and also only one Vice-President. What you describe is, I would say, the normal functioning of the market economy. In a market economy banks – commercial banks, banks in general – have to analyse the various risks – public risk and private risk – being very careful not to take undue many risks. So you are describing the normal preoccupation of the risk management of a financial institution. And we are, as you know, working actively on that in the Basel Committee, in the Financial Stability Board, in order to be as sure as possible that we draw all the lessons from the present crisis. It’s not a Spanish problem, it’s not a European problem, it’s a global problem, and we are reflecting at the global level on these issues. You mentioned also an important emerging economy. In any case we are in a phase of very active interaction with the private sector after the publication of the document of the Basel Committee. And we envisage taking decisions before the end of the year on those very important issues of new appropriate prudential rules and the necessary significant improvements in risk management. And, secondly, just following up on that, the idea of this package is that the interest rates for loans would be, to quote, “non-concessional”, i.e. not contain any subsidy element. Can you tell us how you imagine that being calculated? Does that therefore mean the current market rate at the time that the package is activated? And, then, finally, a broader, political question about the new collateral arrangements. I wonder if you could tell us what the motivation has been for this change. It doesn’t seem to me that it’s about protecting the risk on your balance sheet. It seems to be more moving into a political dimension, a sense that the ECB has a broader responsibility within the euro zone. At the moment the scale is quite restricted to quite a small spectrum. Is it possible that you might expand this at a later stage? And perhaps in this more political context, can you confirm that you now have full currency swap arrangements with Hungary and Poland, suggesting that you are prepared to act more outside the euro zone? As regards your first question on Greece, I would say, at this stage, that what counts is that there has been a decision by the Heads of State and Government. I said already that I was taking it very seriously and as an important decision. The start of the activation of the possible loans is, as far as I understand, in the hands of the Greek government itself. And then, if the loans are called for, the euro area governments will have to see how to organise the package. It is the responsibility of the governments in question, and we in the ECB will liaise with the European Commission, as mentioned by the Heads of State and Government in their previous meeting. And we will be extraordinarily keen on having the executive branches of members of the euro area assume the highest level of responsibility. As far as we are concerned, we will continue to live up to our responsibility as the central bank, together with the national central banks of the euro area, of 330 million people. On the second question, I will not embark on technicalities which are the responsibilities of the executive branches. It is up to governments to decide, but there is a minimum minimorum, which is that the interest rates that would be applied to Greece would be at least the cost of the refinancing by the governments concerned all included. They, themselves, have their own access to markets. But I say that as a remark of an external observer. Again, it is up to the governments in question to see what they will decide in this respect. In any case the principle of no subsidy is absolutely clear. As regards the collateral, you will receive a press release, so you will see exactly what we say. We list the parameters that we will apply. On an issue which was an important one, namely the issue of central government debt instruments at investment grade level, I have already said that the new regime will not change, in practise, the haircuts at the end of the year. For private securities the new regime will incorporate a more pertinent than the 5% add-on that we have today. So, it will be an improvement from the standpoint of our risk management. Let me also mention that the following instruments will no longer be eligible as collateral as from 1 January 2011: (i) marketable debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the euro, including the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Japanese yen, and issued in the euro area; (ii) debt instruments issued by credit institutions, which are traded on the accepted non-regulated markets; and (iii) subordinated debt instruments when they are protected by an acceptable guarantee. These had been part of the enlargement of our collateral framework and will not be in place as from 1 January 2011. It’s an additional clarification I make. On your last point: we have confident and close relationship with the central banks of Hungary and Poland, and I will only say that it is, perhaps, up to them to say exactly what they want to say at this stage on the nature of our very close relationship. You have a unique opportunity to hear from me what I have to say. I will not comment on comments. Ask me questions if you think that I have not been sufficiently clear as regards Greece. Our message was that we need the involvement of the euro area governments, so we would not have been satisfied at all, had we had the IMF alone, with no conditionality coming from the governments of the members of the euro area, without the Eurogroup, and without the peer surveillance and the conditionality that is enshrined in the Treaty of Maastricht and enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact. The heart and core of the problem is fiscal policy and EMU has been based on an E as well as on an M – Economic and Monetary Union. We in the ECB, the Governing Council, are responsible for monetary union. At the same time the core of economic union from the standpoint of conditionality is the Stability and Growth Pact. As an institution we have always defended the Stability and Growth Pact with extreme determination. At one time, in 2004 in particular, several Heads of State and Government in Europe were against the Stability and Growth Pact, which was described as “stupid”. We said NO: EMU is EMU, you have an M and you have an E, and we need the E! The economic component of EMU is essential! And we say the same on this occasion. What is fundamental is not to forget the responsibility of the countries of the euro area as regards their own peer surveillance. We never said that we did not want the IMF to be involved we said that we want the Eurogroup to exercise its full responsibility. I consider that the decision of the Heads of State and Government takes that into account. I said the deal of the Heads of State and Government is good. The IMF is not a minor partner in this deal. And I have always said that the expertise of the IMF is important. The IMF was in Athens when Jürgen Stark and Commissioner Rehn were in Athens, at the time when the government of Greece was finalising the additional measures that they took. First of all, I did not mention Greece myself when I explained what we had decided. You have done so, but we did not. It is for public and private instruments at investment grade level, that we have taken this decision to prolong what exists today and to reinforce the risk management of what exists today as regards, in particular, private securities. I was asked a question, I do not remember whether it was in the context of Greece or not. I accept fully that the interpretation could have been then that for Greek bonds in particular it would have a consequence. But the decision that the Governing Council took is, by definition, for all, and not for any particular country, and is for public instruments as well as for private instruments. For private instruments, it reinforces what exists today in terms of risk management. Let me be clear: we took exceptional measures at a certain time. We have decided that these exceptional measures will be prolonged after the end of the year. We did not say that this was for any particular country or any particular instruments. We are eliminating part of what exists today, and we are also prolonging part of what exists today with a view to reinforcing risk management. For central government bonds at investment grade level, which may be Greek bonds or the bonds of any other country, by definition, we have said that the system of haircuts after the end of the year will be in practise the same as the system that we have today. We are not changing in practise our haircut framework. We are maintaining the system for those particular instruments as it is today. What is changing is that instead of eliminating it at the end of the year, we will maintain the possibility for these investment-grade instruments still to be eligible as collateral. I have nothing else to say on that matter, it is crystal clear, it is all written down and you can form your own judgement. Let me clarify: that quote was reported by some press agencies after I had made a TV broadcast for the French Public Senat. I never said that, because it is not and never was my position. They have issued a correction. That was the title of their reporting about my interview and they have changed the title. I never said that we did not want the IMF to be involved. I said we do not want the IMF alone. Because our message was that we cannot run the euro area if there is no longer a responsibility on the part of the governments of the euro area countries, a responsibility, which is commanded by the Stability and Growth Pact. And perhaps you could give us credit for having defended the Stability and Growth Pact in all circumstances with extreme determination, including when the previous Chancellor of Germany was against it. We maintain this same line with extreme determination and we will continue to do so. It is essential that the governments fulfil their responsibilities. We are all interdependent. When there are important issues here or there, the euro itself moves. We all share a common destiny; wir teilen ein gemeinsames Schicksal. Second, on growth, we talk about fiscal policies, budget consolidation, a common destiny, and so on and so forth. The question is: who feels responsible for growth? Certainly not the European Central Bank, as it is not in your statute. But would we not have to renegotiate certain aspects of the European framework, because growth is crucial? Allow me to take just one example from the real economy which is the young generation. You have certainly seen the latest statistics on youth unemployment from the European Union’s statistical office, Eurostat. Take Greece with 27.5%. But this is only in the middle range. There are countries that are far above it. For example, Spain had almost 41% youth unemployment, which means almost every second young citizen of Spain has no hope of getting a real job in the near future. So what shall we do about it? Shall we leave it as it is and tell people “well, the economy always picks up a bit later after the recovery starts” or are we finally doing something? And what is your message on this? On your second question, as you know, we consider that by delivering price stability in the medium- and long-run, and by being credible in this delivery, we are creating a necessary condition for growth and job creation. This institution has delivered price stability over eleven years, and will very likely have delivered price stability over twelve years by the end of this year, exactly in line with our definition of price stability of less than but close to 2% inflation. We are doing better than what was done by any country in the euro area in the eleven or twelve years before the euro. So we are credible. And we consider that this is a necessary condition for growth and job creation, but not a sufficient condition per se. This is why we are saying that we need good and sound fiscal policies and we have defended inflexibly the Stability and Growth Pact in all circumstances. Now everybody considers that we have been vindicated in that respect. But it was not that easy at the time, I can tell you from my personal experience. Second, we call for extremely bold structural reforms. If we have growth which is not sufficient, it is because we have a lack of structural reforms. And that is obvious when you compare the various European countries, because you see the benefits that those who have appropriate structural reforms are getting out of their reforms. And a last point which is also important is that we call upon the governments, particularly of the euro area, to follow very carefully their relative competitiveness because this is also part of the good management of any country. And it is part of the peer surveillance that must be exercised by the Eurogroup. As regards the lender of last resort function, I am not sure I follow you, because we have a central bank in the euro area, which is the ECB, as the captain of the team, and the members of the team. And together we have all the functions, and we are fulfilling all the functions of a central bank in any other economy. In any case it is a very vast economy. So I do not see your point. Question [Translation from French]: Let me allow myself to put the question to you in French as our Belgian friends did last time. I would like to ask another question about collateral. You said that there has been no change and that it is just an extension of the rules, which are not the normal rules. One might say that the central bank has changed its tune and is now saying that it wants to continue with the extraordinary measures. Can you say why you have changed your opinion? And my second question is about something that is maybe not so important at the moment: the idea put forward by the Germans of a European Monetary Fund. The name is not very appropriate and the ECB has not as yet voiced any opinion on this subject. Was it mentioned today at all? And does the ECB now have a more detailed idea on this concept? [Translation from French] I have already answered the first question on collateral. I would only like to add that at the end of the year there will be a number of operations that are possible today which will no longer be possible. There will be other operations where we will, as we see it, improve our risk management. And there will be other operations for government debt instruments at investment grade level for which there would be in practise no change. They will be eligible under the same conditions as at present. That is the decision of the Governing Council. On a possible European Monetary Fund, I would just say that to use the adjective “monetary” still seems absolutely inappropriate to me. As for the rest, I would say that this is one of the ideas proposed that could perhaps be studied further by the working group that President van Rompuy is going to set up, in line with the decision of the Heads of State and Government. This should allow us to have a considerable improvement in the conditionality and in the application of the conditionality. This should also allow us to have improved crisis resolution. So I think that this is all part and parcel of what will be studied in that group, in which the ECB will also participate. So, is there a need to clarify the message here? My second question relates to what my colleague has just mentioned on the working group that was set up by the Heads of State and Government. Do you think that this working group should also work towards closer coordination and cooperation in terms of economic governance in the euro area – not only fiscal policy, but labour market policy and tax policy, etc? Do you think that this is a necessary condition for Economic and Monetary Union to work in the long run? Thank you. On your first point, I have already said that one interpretation of the fact that you are not subsidising another country would be that the interest rates that you would apply vis-à-vis these other countries would as a minimum minimorum not be below your own interest rates and total costs for your own refinancing. However, I do not want to embark on a discussion about what is clearly the responsibility of the governments themselves. If this deal is activated, it is the responsibility of the governments to decide how to apply the rule that there should be no subsidy element. Regarding your second question, I am speaking at the level of the European Union as a whole, and there are many things: there is the Single Market and there is the EU 2020 strategy which applies to all 27 Member States. The governance of this strategy has been proposed, with new ideas from Mr van Rompuy, including the idea that Heads of State or Government should follow up themselves on these structural reforms at the level of the EU 27. This is something that we consider to be extremely important. For the euro area itself, there are three areas of peer surveillance which, in our opinion, are absolutely fundamental. One is the Stability and Growth Pact. And, as you know, the conditionality that might be imposed by the peers might even involve sanctions, which is something that is extremely strong and the best illustration of the fact that we share a common destiny in the euro area. Second, as I have mentioned already, there is the monitoring of relative competitiveness, namely competitive indicators, including national inflation. In the long run, national inflation – if there is no economic justification that would have to be proved – has to oscillate around the average of the euro area itself. We are setting ourselves the benchmark of below, but close to, 2%, and it is our past record, our determination and our independence that are the guarantee that we will have the same benchmark in the next ten years. This is, of course, a very strong message for all governments of the euro area countries. Lastly, it is our continued strong message to the governments concerned that it is extremely important to have a peer surveillance of the structural reforms that are designed to elevate the growth potential of Europe as a whole, of the EU 27 and, of course, each member of the euro area. My second question is: Would it be correct to say that this is a net loosening of your collateral standards and your monetary policy in that sense? And finally, just a quick technical question: What proportion of the assets submitted to the ECB as collateral is BBB-level? As regards your last question I can’t respond immediately. I don’t want to give you an incorrect answer. On the first question, we discussed what we have decided today. We did not discuss anything else. In any case, in July we will have an overall review of our risk situation. As regards comparing the collateral framework after the end of the year with the present collateral framework, I would say that it will not be loosened. It will be hardened somewhat, for two reasons. One is that – as I have said, and you will see this in the press release – three assets that are eligible today will not be eligible after the end of the year. And in July we will say how we will apply the rules that will improve our risk management in particular for private securities and private collateral. But I have already said that. And can you give us an indication of the maximum amount to be allotted in the upcoming three-month tender procedure? On the first question, we are about to publish the monthly report on the Eurosystem’s covered bond purchase programme. But it’s the usual publication. There is nothing special in there. Just to give you the figures: the total nominal value of all covered bonds purchased by the Eurosystem since the programme was first started stood at €44,898 million on 31 March 2010. So, this is the total value of purchases up to the end of March. As regards the other question, I think that will be published next Monday. No, we did not discuss covered bonds at all. I gave you that information but we did not discuss this question. It wasn’t part of our discussion. I have no particular comment to make on that issue concerning the Greek banks. Of course, the situation is being followed very carefully by us, in coordination with the Greek central bank. I have no other comment to make on that. It is an issue for the governments. They will see for themselves what they consider to be a subsidy or what they do not consider to be a subsidy. In any case, they have to calculate the net present value of what they provide and draw their own conclusions. That is really their responsibility. It is not ECB money; it is the money of the governments. Of course, this is only valid if the package is activated, which presupposes that you have a request from the Greek government and a decision of the executive branches. Perhaps it would be better if you put the question to those who will have to take the decision, and not us. Every institution, every authority has to live up to its responsibilities. We try to live up to our responsibilities. It is not easy. We went through a crisis, as you know, which has been the worst since World War II. And we are a new institution, which was ten years old, and we were not considered particularly clumsy at that time. It was the worst possible challenge for the world’s central banks since World War II, and it could have been even worse. But that said, each institution, each authority has to live up to it responsibilities. I never comment in real time on market reactions. I certainly will not comment on such a question. The market is always right. And it has to be fully respected at all times. But I do not comment on its reaction and particularly not on its reaction – whether up or down – in real time. Yes, I said the market is always right. It will also be right tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, when the spreads have diminished considerably. It is the truth at that moment in time. I will not respond to this question. We will see when the time comes – if the time comes – what the position of the governments is. We will then adopt our position on the basis of what the authorities responsible think. All that we ourselves have said is that there should be no subsidy. "
04/03/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 February 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track, although it is likely to remain uneven. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment marked by continued uncertainty. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At today’s meeting we also discussed, in view of economic and financial market developments, how to proceed with the gradual phasing-out of our non-standard operational measures. In this respect, we decided to continue conducting both the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary – and at least until the end of this year’s ninth maintenance period on 12 October 2010. In the case of the special-term refinancing operations, the fixed rate will be the same as the rate used in the respective MRO. The Governing Council also decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in the regular three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), starting with the operation to be allotted on 28 April 2010. Allotment amounts in these operations will be set with the aim of ensuring smooth conditions in money markets and avoiding any significant spreads between bid rates and the prevailing MRO rate. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided, in line with its decision on the 12-month LTRO of 16 December 2009, to fix the rate in the six-month LTRO to be allotted on 31 March 2010 at the average minimum bid rate of the MROs over the life of this operation. With today’s decisions, the Eurosystem continues to provide liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area at very favourable conditions, thereby facilitating the provision of credit to the euro area. At the same time, these decisions help to avoid distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for longer than needed. The Governing Council will continue to implement the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures. In order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Over recent quarters, the euro area has continued to benefit from the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system, as well as from the ongoing recovery in the world economy. According to Eurostat’s first release, in quarter-on-quarter terms euro area real GDP increased by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009, after growing by 0.4% in the third quarter. Available indicators suggest that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track, although it is likely to remain uneven. In particular, a number of special factors are at play, including adverse weather conditions in parts of the euro area in the first quarter of 2010. Given this uneven pattern, it is more appropriate to look through the quarterly volatility and to compare growth developments on a half-yearly basis. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects real GDP growth to remain moderate in 2010, owing to the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation that the low capacity utilisation is likely to dampen investment and that consumption is being dampened by weak labour market prospects. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 0.4% and 1.2% for 2010 and between 0.5% and 2.5% for 2011. Compared with the Eurosystem staff projections published in December 2009, the range for real GDP growth in 2010 is slightly narrower, while for 2011 the range has been revised slightly upwards, reflecting notably stronger activity worldwide The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced, in an environment marked by continued uncertainty. On the upside, confidence may improve more than expected, and both the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. Furthermore, there may be larger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and renewed tensions in some financial market segments, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.9% in February 2010, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.0% in January. Inflation is expected to be around 1% in the near term and to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. In line with a slow recovery in domestic and foreign demand, overall price, cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued. In this context, it is important to emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 0.8% and 1.6% for 2010 and between 0.9% and 2.1% for 2011. Compared with the Eurosystem staff projections published in December 2009, the range for 2010 has been adjusted marginally downwards, while the range for 2011 has been adjusted slightly upwards. Risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to further developments in economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 turned slightly positive in January 2010, rising to 0.1%. This reflects mainly a base effect and confirms the assessment of continued weak monetary growth. Together with the negative annual rate of growth in loans to the private sector (equal to -0.6% in January 2010), the latest data support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that, in the medium term, the inflationary pressures associated with monetary developments are low. The growth of M3 and loans to the private sector is likely to remain weak also in the coming months. At the same time, actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion, on account of the downward impact of the steep yield curve. This fosters the allocation of funds away from M3 and into longer-term deposits and securities. On the other hand, the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments imply a low opportunity cost of holding funds in the most liquid components included in M1, which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 11.5% in January. The negative annual growth of loans to the private sector conceals ongoing opposite developments: positive, strengthening annual growth in loans to households on the one hand and negative, declining annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other hand. Such differences are consistent with historical patterns and cyclical regularities, which suggest that loans to non-financial corporations can be expected to remain weak for some time after economic activity has picked up. At the same time, the cost of financing for enterprises has declined and the sector as a whole has continued to make extensive use of market-based financing as a substitute for bank financing. Banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets over the past few months, but the challenge remains for them to manage this adjustment while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. To address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 February 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track, although it is likely to remain uneven. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment marked by continued uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. As regards fiscal policies, high levels of public deficit and debt place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the Stability and Growth Pact as a key pillar of Economic and Monetary Union. It is of paramount importance that the stability programme of each euro area country clearly defines the fiscal exit and consolidation strategies for the period ahead. This requires determined efforts, notably on the side of countries with high deficit and debt levels. All countries will be required to meet their commitments under the excessive deficit procedures. Consolidation of public finances should start in 2011 at the latest and will have to exceed substantially the annual adjustment of 0.5% of GDP set as a minimum requirement by the Stability and Growth Pact. A strong focus on expenditure reforms is needed. The Governing Council issued, on 3 March 2010, a statement on the additional fiscal consolidation measures announced by the Greek government. In all euro area countries, the key challenge in order to reinforce sustainable growth and job creation is to accelerate structural reforms. Policies should be adopted which open up market access and increase competition. Overall, it is essential to set the stage for long-term investment in innovation so as to create new business opportunities. Sectoral support schemes implemented to cope with the immediate effects of the crisis should now be phased out. In labour markets, moderate wage setting in several economies and sufficient labour market flexibility are required in order to avoid higher structural unemployment over the coming years. These structural reforms should be supported by an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. I have already said that leaving the euro area is an absurd hypothesis and I confirm that. And, as you can see, as President of the ECB, I consider the decisions that have been taken to be very positive. You know that we have had a number of opportunities (Jürgen Stark, the Vice-President and myself, on behalf of the Governing Council and of the Executive Board) to pass messages to the Greek government. Messages, that have been of the same nature as the messages sent by the European Commission and by the Eurogroup. I myself vividly remember telling the Greek Prime Minister that it was extremely important for the new decisions taken by Greece to be convincing, because they would make the adjustment programme credible, something that was absolutely essential. And the Governing Council considers the decisions that have been taken, which are very substantial, to be convincing. This is certainly something that is very important. The European institutions have functioned. There has been the appropriate surveillance of the policy pursued by that particular country in accordance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission has done its job, and you will remember that, in the statement given by the Heads of State or Government that was published in Brussels, the European Commission was mentioned to be in liaison with the ECB. The ECB has itself been very active and I am very happy with the cooperation we have had with the Commission. The “peers” themselves have done their job, which is extremely important, and the Greek government has taken these decisions. This is the way in which the European institutions function: they adhere to the Treaty and they each fulfil their own role. We appreciate that. And then my second question is, in light of your latest statement on Greece, which is more positive – very nice to see – do you still intend to revert to the old collateral rules for what the ECB accepts at the end of this year? On your first question, we have taken some important decisions today, as you have heard, and we have continued to gradually and in a timely manner phase out the non-conventional measures that we have implemented. These decisions were taken on the basis of an overwhelming consensus and we judge them to be appropriate to the present circumstances, with the three-month operation returning to a variable rate tender, but they were also taken with all the caution I mentioned in the introductory statement. So I think we are, progressively and in a timely manner, accompanying the markets as they progressively return to normal, as we have done in the past, and I think this is important. I say again, as I said three months ago, that there should be no interpretation in terms of the monetary policy stance of this gradual and timely unwinding of the non-conventional measures, and, as far as the monetary policy stance is concerned, we consider it to be appropriate. On your second question, I will only say that by virtue of these convincing decisions taken by the Greek government, we all expect, and it seems to me that we have already seen illustrations of this, that the credibility of the Greek government will increase, and that is the reason why we believe that it was absolutely necessary to take those decisions. I think that what is extremely important in the short run is to enable Greece to get back on its feet, which is the process we are observing now. Remaining in the previous situation would have been more adverse for the growth and the stability of the country. So what has been done is appropriate, we have no doubts about that, and it has given full credibility to the programme that had already been decided upon, but which, prior to these decisions, was lacking credibility. Our own analysis, as you know, is that when there is the phenomenon of a loss of confidence, as it was the case, then you are punished, in terms of growth and job creation, by the loss of confidence much more than you would be by the adverse effect of the adjustment programme. So I have absolutely no doubt that, all things being measured appropriately, Greece is in a much better state today, taking into account its activity and output, than it was before. For us, for the European Commission, for the peers, there is no doubt about that. We appreciate enormously what has been decided because we judge it to be commensurate with the difficulty, as well as a convincing course of action. Lucas, do you want to add something? Papademos: To clarify, you mentioned a 7 percentage points of GDP fiscal adjustment? The planned reduction in the deficit remains the same – i.e. 4 percentage points of GDP. The measures that were announced, which we described as necessary and appropriate, aim to ensure that this ambitious target will be met. So it is not the case that a greater adjustment will take place, but that the additional measures will ensure that the planned reduction in the deficit will be achieved. And if I can add a word in response to your question, I believe that if a fiscal consolidation programme is both credible and durable, it is going to help support economic growth over the medium term and also strengthen employment. This would occur by reducing the cost of financing – both, the public and the private sector – and also by strengthening confidence. As we said in our statement, permanent measures should also include structural reforms which can contribute to restoring the Greek economy’s loss of competitiveness, and this is an additional channel through which growth and employment will be supported in the medium term. Second question, you say we should draw no inference from the decisions today on liquidity for the main policy rate. If I understand it correctly, markets now are pricing in an increase in the main policy rate only in August or September next year. I wonder if you are happy with them pushing out the first rise that far or whether you want to say anything to correct those impressions? And the third question: Mr Nowotny made an interesting comment early this week about how the fate of Greece, the fate of Europe was hanging on the judgement of one rating agency. I think this was meant as a complaint about the role the rating agencies continue to play in your collateral arrangements. Would you like to comment on what he said? As regards your first question, I would stick strictly to the statement by the Heads of State or Government of the European Union. I was present myself, I publicly gave my support for this statement. And it says that “euro area Member States will take determined and coordinated action if needed to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole”. As I already said publicly, I take that commitment to be very important. Let me add that I do not believe that it would be appropriate to introduce the IMF as a supplier of help through standby arrangements or through any such kind of help. I think the IMF’s contribution has been important. I mention the fact that we had experts in Athens with the European Commission and with the IMF. And when Commissioner Olli Rehn and Jürgen Stark were in Athens at the beginning of this week, colleagues from the IMF were also present. So the IMF’s technical assistance is very important, very much appreciated. And we had very good cooperation. The fact is that the conditionality inside the euro area has to be decided, in our opinion, by the peers, according to the Stability and Growth Pact and the European framework as it functions. As regards your second question on the monetary policy stance, you know that it is not customary at all for me to comment on what the market might or might not think. All I would say is that the market knows that we will always take the decision that would permit us to deliver price stability in line with our definition over the medium term. And I think I am credible when I say that. Because through all the difficulties that existed at the global level, all the various shocks that we have had to cope with, at the end of last year the average inflation rate in the euro area since the setting-up of the euro – so over 11 years – was 2.01%. And at the end of this year, we will be below 2%, close to 2%. We will make the exact computation at the end of the year, but I expect something like a little bit more than 1.9 percent as an average over the first 12 years of the euro. It confirms the credibility of our determination to deliver price stability, in accordance with the Treaty. And on the last point, it seems to me that the decisions which have been taken by Greece at this stage are convincing. They are convincing in our eyes, and I expect that they will be convincing in the eyes of many other observers. I have no other comment on your question on rating agencies at this stage. And second in particular on the decisions on the adjustments in how you handle one-month, three-month tenders, was the decision on these unanimous? On your second question first, I said that there was an overwhelming consensus on the decisions on the unwinding of non-conventional measures. I could also say that there was unanimity for the monetary policy stance. On interest rates, that decision was taken unanimously. As regards your first question, I have no comment on rating agencies at this stage. Finally, with regard to inflation again, the forecast has been revised down; in January we saw a fresh low, and core inflation is expected to go down further. Is that of any concern to you at the moment? I would say that we always have to take every aspect into consideration, as we usually do – this was the case, of course, when we took the previous decisions to introduce the non-conventional measures and then to progressively and in a timely manner phase them out. Be sure that we are doing what is appropriate to accompany the financial markets and the money market as they get back to normal. This is a progressive phenomenon and that is why we took the previous decisions. As you see, there is logic in our decisions. First, we phased out the 12-month operations, then we phased out the six-month operations, and now the three-month operations are going back progressively to a variable tender. We will start the first operation exactly in line with what we said: from the second quarter. As regards inflation, we are publishing the ECB staff projections. Today, you can see that the ranges are quite wide, as always. In our opinion, risks are balanced, but it is clear that uncertainty remains quite high and we see upside and downside risks. Looking at growth, there is practically no change in the projection for the year 2010 in comparison with the previous projection that we published three months ago. For 2011, looking at the ranges, the projection is 0.3 percentage point higher. So, this reflects the pick-up of global growth, which and of course has an impact on us, but we are close to the projections that were published three months ago: practically no change for 2010 and a slight upward revision for 2011. With regard to inflation, our projections are also very close to what our staff thought three months ago. We project 0.1 percentage point less inflation this year and 0.1 percentage point more next year. All that being said, on growth you may also remember that we were more prudent and more cautious than many observers, commentators and economists. And we always said that we were not expecting growth to be particularly buoyant and that we were looking at growth as being uneven. I myself spoke of a bumpy road, and I remain very cautious and prudent. All that we have seen up to now confirms that we were wise to be prudent and cautious. Exactly the same message as for all banks. And this message was in the introductory statement. We consider it very important that they take appropriate opportunities to reinforce their balance sheets in order to be fully able to do their job, which is to supply credit and loans to the real economy. It is a global recommendation that banks have to concentrate on financing the real economy; we have helped them considerably in the past and we are continuing to help them, as you can see by the decision that we have taken today, with a view to permitting the real economy to be correctly and appropriately financed by the financial sector. This is important − I am sure that it is of great importance to repeat this message – in the euro area as well as in the rest of the world. Papademos: First of all, I would say that the prompt implementation of all measures that have been announced and all reforms that either have been announced or are going to be introduced in the next two years is very important in order to achieve the desired objectives. In particular, the reform of public administration is essential because it will contribute to reducing spending and the deficit, and even more importantly, it will contribute towards the more efficient, transparent and effective functioning of the State. So, without going into details, I think this is an important proposal and its swift implementation is of the essence. I would say that it is plain wrong. That is my opinion and I believe it is the opinion of all central banks I know. First, it pays very little attention to the conclusions of academic research concerning the fact that at around 2% you probably minimise the counterproductive effects of inflation. Then I think it is totally counterproductive in the present period, when we have to cope with a difficult situation, to contribute to unanchoring inflation expectations. We ourselves have observed how extremely important it was to solidly anchor inflation expectations. By introducing such a change, you would drastically unanchor inflation expectations. And once you do that, of course, you suggest that any new change is possible, in any direction. So it is extremely dangerous. That is the second reason why I am totally opposed to that. Third, I think it would be very counterproductive in the present period of recovery, because it would have as an immediate consequence an increase in all medium and long-term interest rates, to incorporate the new inflation expectations, which would be tentatively 4% instead of less than 2% but close to 2 %. On top of the 2% increase which would be the arithmetic consequence of such a measure, you would also have to pay a risk premium because, if you start changing inflation expectations dramatically, the market can expect further changes. So the increase in market interest rates would be very high. Fourth, in a period when we have to remain as credible, well-anchored and as regards the financial environment, as favourable to growth and to job creation as required, it is clear that creating an inflationary shock could trigger an accelerated inflation phenomenon, which would be very dangerous. These are four reasons that I see immediately. I imagine I would find other reasons if we had more time to consider your question. And my second question is about Greece. Do you believe the Greek government will be able to raise enough money in the bond markets to cover its short-term refinancing needs? On your second question I will only say that I expect that these convincing measures will be convincing in the eyes of all observers. And that is the working assumption I will make. On your first question regarding the investigation, I must confess that I was not aware of that. So I will be cautious and prudent, and I will only say – and I am not speaking for any particular country or issuer – that I believe that we have to continue working very seriously – as we do – at a global level and through the methodology that we have agreed upon, with the G20, the Financial Stability Board, the various working groups and working parties that we have created, to understand exactly the nature of the potential impact on global financial stability of the size of this hedge fund industry. This is a highly leveraged and speculative industry. I have no definitive response at this stage. But I believe that this will form part of the effort which we have to make at a global level to ensure that the financial system is much more stable. And, I repeat, we cannot afford to return to a situation of financial instability such as what we have been experiencing for two and a half years. We would not be forgiven for that by our own people in our own democracies. Nor would we be forgiven by the rest of the world, which has confidence today in our capacity to correctly apply the rules of the game of the market economy. So we must be sure that we have a global financial system which is reasonably stable. And some of the observations that have been made and that you refer to suggest that, perhaps, because of this particular industry, among others, we have a problem with regard to stability. So I will not give you a definite response, but it is a very serious question. You know that for the euro area – which has a single currency, the euro – my goal is that executive branches would speak with one voice. This is extremely important. Let me just say that, as far as I am concerned I consider it is important that the US authorities say – as they do – that a strong dollar is in the interests of the United States. It is also, I believe, in the interests of the partners of the United States. I am talking about those currencies that float freely. This is the case for the euro, of course, and a number of other major floating currencies. It is not necessarily the case for currencies that do not float freely. And my second question is on your growth forecast. Next year’s growth forecasts have, as you have said, been revised upwards slightly. To what extent is this a reflection of increased confidence in the economy? Or is this basically the result of a technical assumption, such as the lower trade-weighted euro? And one final question: One of my colleagues asked you earlier about whether you would repeat the comment you made earlier this year and late last year that you would not change the collateral rules to suit Greece. Can you answer the question this time? On your first question, let me just say that what I have said on behalf of the Governing Council is pretty clear. I said “for as long as needed and at least until the end of this year’s ninth maintenance period on 12 October 2010”, and the date covered the third quarter. So we are not committed as regards anything else, and we will judge what needs to be done when the time comes. As regards your second question, I really believe that what we are doing is accompanying the markets’ return to normal functioning. And, as I have said, this does not affect the monetary policy stance itself. As regards growth, the information we have – and I think the staff of the ECB are very much in line with the position adopted by the staff of the Eurosystem three months ago – is extremely close to most of the public and private sector projections. I would say that it is true that the main reason why we see the upward revision of growth data for 2011 is that the global environment is more favourable. That is undoubtedly the main reason. As regards your third question on the collateral rules, I said what I was expecting, taking into account the very convincing decisions taken by Greece, and I have no other comment on that. I do not want to enter into some kind of fantasy scenario. Let me just say that belonging to the euro area is something which helps you considerably. When you are in the euro area, you have a kind of automatic financing of your current account. And when you have a current account deficit, as has been the case for Greece for a long period of time, you get the financing of your current account deficit, because the other economies of the euro area take care of that. So we are, in a way, in a system which is very different from the usual environment. When you are inside the euro area, you are helped by the very fact of belonging to the euro area, and you are helped considerably. Adding up the current account deficits year after year, for instance gives a considerable proportion of GDP. On the other hand, you also have to respect the rules – the Stability and Growth Pact in particular. And you know the determination which with the ECB defended the Stability and Growth Pact at a time when it was regarded as “stupid”. We can see now that it is not stupid; it is a fundamental pillar of the euro area. The fact is you have to respect the rules in advance. You have to permanently respect the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. So, being in the euro area obviously means being in a situation which is very special. I would always insist very much on that. Let me only say that I have no position of the Governing Council of the ECB to give on such an idea. Again, we are in a situation in the euro area which is special because you have a level of help to the financing of the balance of payments which is given ex ante by the sole virtue of belonging to the euro area. As regards the statement which has been made by the Heads of State or Government, I have already read it and I see it as committing the Heads of State or Government in case we would have to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole. It is good to look at all ideas on possible initiatives, but I have no particular comment at this stage. Question [Translation from French]: I would like to ask you about the ECB’s rates which have been very low for almost one year now. If you compare this with the rates which stayed low for a long time in the United States and created the financial bubble which caused the problems we are now experiencing, should we be concerned about the formation of a new bubble? If so, or if not, why? I am referring in particular to consumer credit as lending to households is reported to be rising. Trichet  [Translation from French] : I believe I can reassure you about credit itself because corporate lending is actually decreasing and consumer credit is increasing but only a little. Therefore, we cannot say that we are observing a credit bubble due to the low level of interest rates. This is not the case at all. That said we have to always remain alert. I have said how vigilant we have been in not maintaining non-conventional measures which would no longer be warranted by market circumstances. And as for monetary policy and interest rates, we are very careful to do what is necessary, without pre-commitment, without being obliged to behave in too lax a manner, or perhaps on the contrary in too tough a manner, because we would have made a commitment previously. So to summarise [in English of the above answer given in French], we are far from having a credit bubble now, but we have to remain cautious and alert in order to avoid having for too long a time the non-conventional measures that could be inappropriate in this respect. With regard to our monetary policy stance, as you know, we never pre-commit, we always take the decision that we judge appropriate so that we are never trapped by a pre-commitment that would appear not exactly appropriate later on. That is part of our overall concept of monetary policy. You should ask the ministers and the Heads of State or Government that question. I would not say that, because what we are expecting is a normal behaviour of the market. By the time we reach the end of the twelve-month period since we had our twelve-month “jumbo refinancing”, we expect that we will still have a level of liquidity which would be very abundant. So, we continue to handle the money market with this level of liquidity. We will see exactly what is appropriate. I have always said that the way we were operating ourselves the supply of liquidity had an impact on the EONIA rate that is true. So, we will see exactly what happens, but again it is not our intention at this stage to give a signal in terms of monetary policy interest rates. Not in the short run. Question [Translation from French]: I would like to know what the key message of Olli Rehn was at your meeting and if he was there upon your invitation? Trichet  [Translation from French] : Olli Rehn was here upon my invitation, but also because according to the Treaty he has the right to attend our meetings. We appreciate enormously the cooperation which has been established very rapidly in the case of Greece and also of course in other areas with the Commissioner and I think it was very good that we could cooperate confidently on this very important issue. That was the last question. But because we have taken a lot of decisions today, I still have to tell you that the Governing Council has given an opinion on the appointment of the Vice-President of the ECB. The Governing Council has no objection to the proposed candidate Mr Vítor Constâncio, who is a person of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, and I am quoting the Treaty itself, as required by Article 253(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. So, if I summarise everything that we have decided in the Governing Council yesterday and today, I have the judgement on the recovery programme of Greece; I have the opinion on the Vice-President, which is proposed by the executive branches; and I have also the approval of the accounts of 2009. I do not want to embark on the precise details of the accounts, there will be a press release giving all these details. Let me only say that we earned a surplus of €2.218 billion in 2009, compared with €2.661 billion in 2008. There is a technical adjustment to our risk provisions, so the net profit for 2009 amounts to €2.253 billion. The new projections will also be explained in detail in a communiqué. And, finally, additional information will be provided on the phasing-out of the non-standard measures and the monthly report on the covered bond purchase programme. "
04/02/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference today. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 14 January 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that euro area economic activity continued to expand around the turn of the year. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010. The recovery process is likely to be uneven and the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest information confirms that economic activity in the euro area continued to expand around the turn of the year. The euro area has been benefiting from a turn in the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, these stimuli will unwind over time, while activity is likely to be adversely affected by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, both inside and outside the euro area. In addition, low capacity utilisation rates are likely to dampen investment, and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further, thereby lowering consumption growth. For these reasons, the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process could be uneven. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced. On the upside, confidence may improve more than expected, and both the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. Furthermore, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation increased further in January 2010 to stand at 1.0%, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 0.9% in December 2009. Inflation is expected to be around 1% in the near term and to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. In line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere, overall price, cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued. In this context, it is important to emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to the further development of economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 remained negative in December 2009, standing at -0.2%. In the same period, annual growth in loans to the private sector was zero. These data continue to support our assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. Actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion, owing to the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve. Looking ahead, M3 and credit growth is likely to remain weak for some time to come. The prevailing interest rate constellation continues to have a strong influence on both the level and composition of annual M3 growth. On the one hand, the low rates of remuneration on short-term bank deposits foster the allocation of funds away from M3 and into longer-term deposits and securities. On the other hand, the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different short-term deposits imply a low opportunity cost of holding funds in the most liquid components included in M1, which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of more than 12% in December. The zero annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector reflects a further increase in the growth in loans to households, while the annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations moved further into negative territory. Such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities. The ongoing contraction in the outstanding amounts of loans to non-financial corporations continues to be accounted for entirely by a strong net redemption of loans with a short maturity. For the sector as a whole, the overall contraction may be due partly to substitution with market-based financing. Given the typical lags between turning points in economic activity and those in the demand for bank loans, growth in loans can be expected to remain weak over the months to come. In the meantime, the real cost of external financing for non-financial enterprises has declined further, while the net tightening of credit standards applied by banks has continued to diminish, as indicated by the Bank Lending Survey for the last quarter of 2009. At the same time, banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets over the past few months. In this respect, the challenge remains for banks to adjust the size and structure of their balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. To address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. This is important to facilitate access to finance, especially for those enterprises that do not have recourse to market-based financing. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 14 January 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that euro area economic activity continued to expand around the turn of the year. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010. The recovery process is likely to be uneven and the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system, while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long. The Governing Council will, in early March, take decisions on the continued implementation of the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past. In order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, many euro area countries are faced with large, sharply rising fiscal imbalances, leading to less favourable medium and long-term interest rates and lower levels of private investment. Moreover, high levels of public deficit and debt place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the Stability and Growth Pact as a key pillar of Economic and Monetary Union. Against this background, it is of paramount importance that the stability programme of each euro area country clearly defines the fiscal exit and consolidation strategies for the period ahead. Countries will be required to meet their commitments under the excessive deficit procedures. Consolidation of public finances should start in 2011 at the latest and will have to exceed substantially the annual adjustment of 0.5% of GDP set as a minimum requirement by the Stability and Growth Pact. A strong focus on expenditure reforms is needed. The key challenge in order to reinforce sustainable growth and job creation is to accelerate structural reforms, as the financial crisis has negatively affected the productive capacity of our economies. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities. In labour markets, moderate wage-setting, effective incentives to work and sufficient labour market flexibility are required in order to avoid significantly higher structural unemployment over the coming years. Finally, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. In reply to your first question on Greece, I would say that the position of the ECB is the following: the ECB Governing Council approves of the medium-term goal that has been fixed by the Greek government, to get the public finance deficit back to less than 3% as a proportion of GDP in 2012. Now, we expect and we are confident that the Greek government will take all the decisions that will permit it to reach that goal. In this respect, the measures taken last Tuesday, namely the taxation on oil, the freezing of wages in the public sector and the pension reform, are steps in the right direction. In any case, the deficit targeted for 2010 has to be attained, as well as the final goal of less than 3% in 2012. This strategy is crucial for medium-term sustainable growth and job creation in Greece. That is what I had to say on Greece. On other countries and on Greece, you could see in the introductory remarks what the Governing Council had said. It is a very strong goal of having to fully respect the Stability and Growth Pact, and fully respect the excessive deficit procedure. And you know that each country has its own goal in terms of going down to below 3%. And we consider, of course, that all this is crucial. You know that we have always been inflexible in our defence of the Stability and Growth Pact. Even at a time when we had some countries (in 2004 for instance and also a little bit in 2005) that were calling for significant alleviation of the constraints of the Pact, we always said that we are in an economic and monetary union. We are ourselves responsible for the monetary union part of it. The main pillar of the economic union is the Stability and Growth Pact. And the least I can say is that we have been vindicated in this respect. Let me also say that, looking at the euro area, there is very often a misunderstanding. A lot of people imagine that you have this kind of sequence: you have problems and you get help, and conditionality comes with the help. This is the normal case for a country which is not in the euro area, which is in the rest of the world. In the euro area, the situation is very different: you have ex-ante (not ex-post) help because you are in the euro area, then you have an easy inbuilt financing of the current account deficit. We have seen that functioning extremely well over the years: very easy financing of the current account deficit, which is the kind of help given by international financial institutions. But it is given ex ante, in our case, and the conditionality is also ex ante. It is, in particular, the Stability and Growth Pact, namely the Commission’s work on checking the quality and the level of soundness which is embedded in the fiscal policies and, on that basis, the peer’s surveillance with the relevant peer’s decision where needed. And that is the reason why we call for the Stability and Growth Pact to be strictly respected in all circumstances. In response to your question on fiscal issues, the Governing Council considered that loose fiscal policy can overburden the monetary policy at the level of the euro area as a whole. But now I will surprise most of you: do you know what the consolidated public finance deficit of the euro area is? All countries taken into account – and you know that when we reflect on monetary policy, we have to take into account the 330 million people and the 16 countries – this deficit should be around 6% of GDP in 2010, according to the IMF. Allow me to mention what it is for other major industrialised countries: it will probably be a little bit more than 10% for the US according to the IMF, and also a little bit more than 10% for Japan, which is more than 4% above the consolidated fiscal deficit of the euro area. And you can find other important industrialised countries with deficits that are even higher than 10%. So I mention that en passant to say very clearly that it is not because, according to the IMF, we have at a consolidated level only 6% in the present circumstances that we consider that it is acceptable. It is a potential burden on the monetary policy and we call for strict implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the excessive deficit procedure goals. The stability programmes will also be examined. They were due to be submitted before the end of January and this was done in practically all cases, as you might know. Thank you very much for very good questions indeed. Thank you very much for your questions. On Greece, I have said what I have to say. They have to reach the goals that they have set themselves. This is absolutely crucial, and we expect and are confident that they will take the measures, such as those taken last Tuesday, that will allow them to reach their goal. That is fundamental. It is our position. I was very clear on that. As regards the procedure for the withdrawal of the non-standard measures, I will see you again after our next monetary policy meeting in early March, as I have said. At that meeting we will take the decision that you are waiting for regarding the second quarter. And as you know, we are now implementing the decision that we took for the first quarter. As regards the third point, again I will not single out any countries. I will just say that all countries will have to fully respect what has been decided upon in the excessive deficit procedures. We ourselves will be alert – as will be the Commission – in ensuring that this commitment is respected by all countries, without exception I will see you in one month’s time and tell you what we will do. As you know, we have already decided that this will be the last six-month refinancing operation, but as regards the details you are asking for, you will have them next month. I do not participate in the game of commenting on the comments of others. I am here representing the Governing Council’s position. On exchange rates, you know what I have to say, which is very clear. I appreciate enormously the fact that the US authorities are themselves saying that a strong dollar vis-à-vis the other major floating currencies is in the interests of the United States. And I believe that it is in the interests of the United States, as well as in the interests of the rest of the world, including Europe. As regards the second question, I have already responded to that in stressing the point – which was not necessarily known by all of us – that in our case, belonging to the euro area means that you have, ex ante, considerable help. In terms of GDP, I will let you do the calculations showing the kind of easy financing of the balance of payments deficit experienced by members of the euro area. So, ex ante help and ex ante conditionality. This conditionality is enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact, following a proposal from the Commission to the peers. And such peer assessment, peer judgement and peer decisions – including decisions on possible sanctions – are at the heart of the Stability and Growth Pact. As regards the overall lessons to be learnt from the global crisis, we have an agreement at the global level on the methodology and on the main avenues to pursue our work, and we are working very actively. I always call for ideas, which could be interesting, that are submitted to the international community by different countries to be examined and studied very professionally, actively and rapidly, because the international community requires us to be reasonably expeditious. We have the G20, we have the Financial Stability Board, we have the various working groups, including, of course, the Basel Committee – but not just the Basel Committee: all of this has been agreed upon by the industrialised countries and by the emerging countries, and I think that this consensus is a major asset in this very difficult crisis we have to cope with. It is a major asset that the entire world – all the systemically important countries, whether industrialised or emerging – have agreed upon the methodology and the main avenues that we have to pursue to be sure that the system is much more resilient in the future than it was in the past. I would only say that there are a number of criteria. The unemployment criterion is not on the list of criteria that we will have to examine. What is important for us is that all those criteria which we have to examine are met. There is also the Treaty obligation that these criteria have to be met not only at the moment of the examination but also on a sustainable basis. That is what is absolutely essential, and always has been, in the eyes of the Governing Council. The criteria have to be met not only today but on a sustainable basis. This is true not just for Estonia but for all countries, of course. Trichet : I never comment on the market itself. I think that it is not necessarily very well known how solid the euro area actually is – the concept of the euro area. I, myself, have, over 20 years, had to explain tirelessly, on a lot of occasions, what we have been doing. So, I have no further comments to make. Let me only mention the fact that the euro area, as a concept, is in the position I have already underlined and, for the euro area as a whole, we are in a situation which compares very flatteringly with a number of industrialised countries. This is not an excuse to become complacent. We have a track record of absence of complacency and we will continue on that path. I am not responding on Greece, as your question was not on Greece but on all countries. The Stability and Growth Pact is a framework that applies what is in the Treaty itself, which is very strong. Because the peers enlightened by the Commission and observed by us have to decide whether a situation is abnormal and which kind of decision should be taken. If the recommendations are not followed by facts and by real decisions, there are sanctions, which would be decided by peers. So the system is very constraining. When you share a single currency with others, the counterpart is that you have to have a sound fiscal policy. It’s been said since the very beginning and there is nothing new there. I said all that myself when, at the time, there was some teasing of the concept of the Stability and Growth Pact. A number of us might have a very vivid memory of that. There was a strong call to weaken the Stability and Growth Pact. We said “No!”. It is a crucial part of EMU and there is nothing new in what happens now. It is the implementation of what is required by the Pact. With Ireland being an English-speaking country, we rely very much in our rhetoric in English on the suggestions which are given by the Irish governor and Irish friends. I will say that we all have to remain alert, permanently. This is no time for complacency. But let me also add that the decisions that have been taken by the Irish government to put its house in order have been very impressive. I believe that they were right, and I take it that this is probably what the Minister of Finance was alluding to. Strict implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the excessive deficit procedures is crucial. I have no other comment. Of course, it is better to have low treasury interest rates than to have higher treasury interest rates. This is true, and this is the way you are rewarded when you do the job. I already responded to the exchange rate question. On Germany, I look with my colleagues, including the central bank governors, at the euro area as a whole, the 330 million people. Germany represents a very important part of the euro area, and so attention is of course paid to this particular economy. I think what we can say is that this country protected itself in the very difficult situation in which we were all put, particularly on the employment front, in a way which is quite impressive. We are all reflecting, not only in Europe but also at the global level, on the different behaviours that we have observed from the employment angle in various countries, to understand better what dynamics are at stake and what might explain those differences. Now, we will see what happens in this country, which is very highly internationalised, which has specialisations that are important, particularly as regards capital goods, machine tools, equipment and so forth. We will see exactly what happens when we have confirmation of the growing recovery in Asia, in particular in emerging Asian countries, and in the emerging world economies altogether. I expect that in this episode of the recovery, Germany will probably have more orders and more exports, which will contribute to its growth. I respond to the question because you asked a very specific question, but I cannot embark on responding to questions on particular countries. We are looking at a continent: 330 million people, 16 countries. It is as numerous as the United States, and I doubt that, in a press conference, Ben Bernanke would have a question on Alaska or Massachusetts… I don’t think so. In terms of sustainable growth and job creation, if you are obviously in a very bad situation, say in terms of fiscal policy, then you have no confidence in your country, and then households have no confidence, entrepreneurs have no confidence, and you cannot expect a recovery that would be satisfactory. You have to be credible in your medium-term path towards fiscal policy sustainability, and then you will gain the confidence of the households and of the entrepreneurs. When you are in a very difficult situation you cannot reason using the idea that the economy respects the usual linear model – you are in a special situation, where the main problem is to regain the confidence of your own economic agents precisely to get back to growth and job creation. And I would say the same for structural reforms. There is no particular reason why structural reforms would not help growth. Of course, they are there mainly in order to help growth in the medium and long term, but by increasing confidence they can also help in the shorter term. In any case, now that we have been examining the euro area for 11 years, we have observed that you have the same overall big business cycle at the level of the euro area as a whole, and then you have country differences compared with the business cycle of the euro area. And it is clear that those countries that were growing very fast in the past now have growth which is more modest, and those that were not necessarily growing very fast (Germany, for instance) will perhaps demonstrate that they are now growing more dynamically and actively. These oscillations are not abnormal, when you have to cope with such a large integrated economy as the euro area. It is not customary for me to say in advance what we will discuss in the G7 meetings. I am very happy to be going so far up, to the very north of Canada. We will have just the right environment to be as cool as possible in judging the situation! I believe it is important for the industrialised countries to have this kind of opportunity for meditation, also taking into account their responsibility, including as regards the recent crisis. And we will cover the usual important issues, but let us not forget that it has been decided, and I stick very firmly to that decision, that the prime grouping for international cooperation is the G20; it is no longer the G7 in this format of ministers and governors. And I also have to say that we, central banks, fully accept that. We were even, in some respects, anticipating that in our constituency of central banks. We think that the cooperation between us now has to take place under the governance of a larger group, including the emerging countries’ central banks. On your second question, as you know, we are delivering price stability in the medium term. The strict inflation targeters – but they have now enlarged and enriched their own initial concept – were targeting inflation in, say, approximately two years, and the policy was like a guided missile: the guided missile was modified in order to hit the target in two years’ time. So what happens for inflation in 2011 as an average is not, even for the strict inflation targeters, the target. But for us, we always said that we have a wider concept of “medium term”, and that we were not sticking to an inflation target in 24 months in our own monetary policy concept. Very often, I myself refer, as a very important indicator for the anchoring of inflationary expectations, to the “five-year forward break-even inflation rate five years ahead”, which, again, shows to what extent we are looking at the medium and longer term for ensuring that price stability in the medium term is in line with our definition. I have no problem with the present level of expectations for average inflation over the next year. I take into consideration the fact that we are in a period following the worst recession since the Second World War, and the inflationary expectations that we are looking at as the pertinent indicators confirm that we are at the level of 1.9%. It is not a secret: I can tell you that the next survey of professional forecasters will give us, for five years, 1.9%, which is a confirmation of the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations that I mentioned in the introductory statement. Five years. It is a good question. It is not necessarily only the pleasure of being in the cool environment. Even if it is absolutely clear that the prime grouping for cooperation is the G20 − and that is very clear and fully accepted, it seems to me, by the G7, and fully accepted by the central banks, which again have themselves in some way anticipated this evolution − nevertheless, it is not absurd for the industrialised countries, which have a major responsibility in the present situation, to meet together, as do the emerging countries themselves from time to time, without claiming any global authority. Do you know where the crisis came from? It came from the industrialised world. So, I think it is not necessarily useless to have this kind of meeting. But you are absolutely right: it is of a different nature now, clearly. And there is clear-cut consensus at a global level that it is of a different nature. And I am sure that Jim Flaherty will mention that very well when he sums up the discussion in Canada. First of all, obviously I prefer that the banks are making money. Because when they were losing money it created a catastrophe. We have to be consistent: we ourselves have been in a very difficult situation, because we had a terrible crisis of the financial sector. Second, profits, in our opinion, should serve not to distribute enormous amounts of dividends to shareholders; not to distribute enormous amounts of bonuses, packages, remunerations to the members of these institutions; but to reinforce their balance sheets, to reinforce their own position as financial institutions that have a role to play, which is to finance the real economy as actively as possible. By the way, I did not have too many questions on growth of credit, on the outstanding credit growth of non-financial corporations, on SMEs, and so forth. We are looking at that with enormous care and we consider that it is extremely important in the present period that there is no supply constraint on the credit allocation by the financial system to the clients, customers, enterprises and households. With regard to households, now we see that the outstanding credit is picking up again, which is of course a good sign, and we know also that the recession was such that it is not abnormal at this stage that we still have dynamics of credit which are negative as regards the non-financial corporations. All that being said, our message to the banks is very clear: it is good that you are now making money; we prefer that you make money instead of lose money, because when you were losing money it was a drama. But, do not forget that you have a duty. Our commitment as central banks to avoid the depression, and the commitment of the taxpayer, has been such that the banks have to understand that. I am sure that they will understand that. We cannot accept that we will have supply constraints in the present period. "
14/01/2010,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our first press conference in 2010. Let me take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 3 December 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that towards the end of 2009 euro area economic activity continued to expand. However, some of the factors supporting the growth in real GDP are of a temporary nature. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter increase in real GDP in the third quarter of 2009, the latest information confirms that towards the end of last year economic activity in the euro area continued to expand. The euro area has been benefiting from a turn in the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature. Furthermore, there is likely to be a drag on activity for some time to come on account of the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, both inside and outside the euro area. In addition, low capacity utilisation rates are likely to dampen investment, and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further, thereby lowering consumption growth. For these reasons, the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process could be uneven. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve further, and the global economy as well as foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disruptive market movements related to the correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, as expected, euro area annual HICP inflation increased further in December 2009 to stand at 0.9%, after 0.5% in November. The rise mainly reflects upward base effects stemming mostly from the drop in global energy prices a year ago. Inflation is expected to remain around 1% in the near term. Looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon, with overall price, cost and wage developments staying subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to emphasise, once again, that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, both the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector were negative in November, standing at -0.2% and -0.7% respectively. The concurrent declines to historically low growth rates recorded in these two series over the past months support the assessment of a decelerating underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. Looking ahead, M3 and credit growth are likely to remain very weak or negative for some time to come. The decline in actual monetary growth is likely to overstate the deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion. This is due to the continued steep slope of the yield curve, which explains shifts of funds out of M3 into longer-term deposits and securities. At the same time, the interest rate constellation continues to foster divergent developments in the main components of M3, as the narrow spreads between the rates on different short-term bank deposits reduce the opportunity costs of shifting funds from, for instance, short-term time deposits into overnight deposits. As a result, M1 continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 12.6% in November, when annual M3 growth turned negative. The negative annual growth of bank loans to the private sector conceals a return to positive annual rates of growth in the case of loans to households, while the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations became more negative. Such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities, with turning points in the growth of loans to enterprises typically lagging those in economic activity. In the case of households, the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates. In the case of non-financial corporations, the decline in loans continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity, while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive. The subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook, will probably continue to dampen firms’ demand for bank financing in the months to come. In the meantime, financing conditions for enterprises have improved over recent months in terms of the cost of both bank credit and market financing. In this respect, the continued negative flows in short-term bank loans to non-financial corporations observed in recent months may partly reflect better possibilities for substitution with different sources of longer-term financing. Banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets, mainly through downsizing the assets held vis-à-vis other banks. The challenge remains to adjust the size and structure of balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. To address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 3 December 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that towards the end of 2009 euro area economic activity continued to expand. However, some of the factors supporting the growth in real GDP are of a temporary nature. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system, while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long. The Governing Council will also continue to implement the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past. In order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, many euro area governments are faced with high and sharply rising fiscal imbalances. The very large government borrowing requirements carry the risk of triggering rapid changes in market sentiment, leading to less favourable medium and long-term market interest rates. This, in turn, would dampen private investment and thereby weaken the foundations for sustained growth. Moreover, high levels of public deficit and debt would place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the credibility of the provisions of both the Treaty on European Union and the Stability and Growth Pact as a key pillar of Economic and Monetary Union. The Governing Council therefore calls upon governments to decide and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions, with a strong focus on expenditure reforms. Tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term, when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre. In this regard, current government commitments to start consolidation in 2011 at the latest and to go well beyond the structural benchmark for adjustment of 0.5% of GDP per annum represent the minimum requirement for all euro area countries. The success of fiscal adjustment strategies will also depend, crucially, on appropriate national budgetary rules and institutions and requires transparent budgetary procedures, as well as reliable and complete government finance statistics. Turning to structural reforms, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability. The Eurosystem will submit its response to the European Commission’s public consultation on the EU 2020 strategy, which is designed as a successor to the current Lisbon strategy. To address future challenges, the EU 2020 strategy should focus on raising potential growth and creating high levels of employment through well-functioning labour and product markets, sound financial systems and sustainable fiscal policies. The aim is to achieve a highly competitive social market economy, as spelled out in the Treaty. We are now at your disposal for questions. And my second question, I almost hesitate to ask, but many American and English bank market watchers keep putting this across to us: how realistic do you see this talk about Greece or possibly other countries either being pushed out of, or leaving, the euro? As I said, it has been put to us time and time again. It sounds very unrealistic, but how do you view this? Let me take your second question first. I do not comment myself on absurd hypotheses, so that would be my response. That being said, there is a lot of hard work to do, and you can see the extent to which the Governing Council has been stressing the necessity to have appropriate measures and appropriate implementation of the measures as regards fiscal policy. This is key for all countries. Our message is for all members of the euro area. It is very important for those of them which have a special deterioration to redress the situation in taking the appropriate bold and courageous measures for their own prosperity and recovery. We trust that this is essential to improve confidence, and you know the extent to which we consider that confidence is key in the present economic situation in Europe as well as in the world. And let us say Greece’s credit ratings were BBB+ across the board in December: would you consider delaying a return to the old collateral rules? We will not change our collateral framework for the sake of any particular country. Our collateral framework applies to all countries concerned. And that has been said already by the Vice-President, by me and by colleagues. That is crystal clear. As regards your second question I will not comment on the ratings. I will only say that, as far as I know, the Greek government, the Greek Council of Ministers, is taking a number of decisions today. I have had absolutely no time to look at the decisions that are being taken. I know that the intention is to deliver a public finance deficit that, if I am not mistaken, would be below 3% as soon as 2012. We will look at and examine this very carefully. But this is information which is coming in now, because the Council of Ministers met this very morning. And do you see any risk at all of a set back of the euro zone’s recovery in the first quarter? As regards the handling for the last six months operation, we already decided that it will be the last, as you know. As regards the MROs after the first quarter we did not discuss which way we will proceed. All these decisions will be taken at our first meeting in March. As regards your second question, I have been very clear on behalf of the Governing Council. We consider that, as we have frequently said, we have a period in front of us which is, fortunately, in black figures but which is uneven. I often use the expression “we have a bumpy road ahead of us”. So there is a great level of uncertainty and we could pretty well have a rate of growth from quarter to quarter that would go up and down. I do not exclude that. As an average for next year, the mainstream of experts and analysts, as well as our own staff, is projecting slightly positive growth. But the uncertainty is quite high and I have mentioned the fact that around this baseline scenario we see risks on the upside and also on the downside. So, we have to remain very alert, very prudent. And you know, since the start of the black figures, we have never claimed victory. We have always said we have to remain alert and prudent. That was the essence of the communication of the Governing Council. And last, but not least, we’ve been talking to more than 60 economists. All agree, on average, that some 50 basis points in rate hikes will occur at the end of this year. Do you have any message to them with regard to the expectation of that? First of all, as regards our monetary policy, the position of the Governing Council is crystal clear. And I’ll just sum it up on behalf of the Governing Council: we are looking at inflation in the medium term, price stability in the medium term, and we see at the moment I am speaking no risk for a destabilisation of our prices. That being said, you have uncertainty and risks in both directions. But we see that they are balanced. As regards your second question I will not say anything on future interest rates. You know our position. It is a clear-cut position. We always take decisions that are appropriate to deliver price stability in the medium term. It is what has permitted us to anchor, very solidly, inflation rate expectations and that is essential in all circumstances, including in very difficult circumstances like today. I will not comment on the market pricing-in future decisions. And then, for the credit crunch, I hear that you are a little bit less pessimistic. Is that true? And do you think there is a necessity that government supports the risk of lending by banks so that banks are more encouraged to lend? On the first question, as you know, we have enormous difficulties ahead of us. We did our job properly in the past because we took very bold decisions and avoided depression. It is extremely important that all the economic agents realise the seriousness of the situation we would have had without the rapidity and the boldness of the decisions taken by the ECB and other central banks or the decisions of our governments. We avoided that, but we still had a big recession and a lot of problems. We are called upon to reform the financial system. I have to say that the work which has been done by all of us,– I’m speaking in particular of the ECB’s Governing Council as a whole and of a number of members of the Governing Council in various positions, and also of the international community – was as good as possible a job. But this is no time for complacency. I think that the Financial Stability Board (FSB) did a very good job in such a difficult situation. A member of the Governing Council chairs the FSB. The Basel Committee has done a very good job and it is also a member of the Governing Council who is very active there. And I would say that the G20 has been extremely important in enlarging global governance as well as in working out a consensus on the methodology and goals for drawing the lessons from the crisis. But again, this is no time for complacency. We have a very hard job ahead of us. I have already told you that we cannot afford to have a financial system which is as fragile in the future as it has proved to be in the past. Our democracies in particular would not accept that. And, in my opinion, would not stand ready to do in the future what they have accepted to do in the past. So we are obliged to find appropriate ways for making the system more resilient. As regards your second question on the credit situation, as I have mentioned, overall loans to the private sector are now in negative figures. The figures last October were already negative, and the November figures confirmed these at -0.7%. , so I would say slightly negative. We have observed, and this is something we have to monitor very carefully, that loans to households were back to black figures in November after having been slightly negative in October. They are now at +0.5%. We are not surprised, as I said earlier that unfortunately loans to non-financial corporates are in negative figures, (-1.9%) even if we observe negative figures for short-term loans and still black figures for longer-term loans over five years in particular. We are monitoring that very carefully. We had a very deep recession and what we have always observed in such cycles is that there are lagged effects for the outstanding credit growth for non-financial corporates. So we expect that these red figures may continue for a number of months, both for loans to non-financial corporates, for overall loans to the private sector and also for M3 which were slightly negative in November. I have explained already why the dynamics inside the various components of M3 were extraordinarily different. This is not surprising taking into account the present level of interest rates As regard your last question I will not suggest that, at this stage, taking into account the very important and bold decisions already taken by governments, our democracies will necessarily renew what they accepted to do at the peak of the crisis. I have already said what I had to say with regard to our own position. No government, no state can expect any special treatment from us. We have our own rules, and we will apply our own rules without special treatment of any kind. We know that some governments – one in particular, but not only one – that several governments have very tough and very difficult decisions to take. But the problem of “help” is not the real problem. By belonging to the euro area, you are already helped because in particular you have an easy means of financing your current account deficit. You share a currency that is credible, so that you have a quality of financing that corresponds to that of a credible currency. The problem is thus not one of “help”. The problem is one of doing the job, of taking the appropriate decisions. That is what is at stake. And the second question is for Mr Papademos. Mr Papademos, what role might you play in Greek political affairs after you leave the ECB? Good question – we were unanimous in our decision. Papademos: You will not be surprised if I say that I will not give an answer to your question. When I leave the ECB, I will examine the prospects and will inform you in due time. I already answered that question. And my second question: Recently, Slovenian and French politicians have complained about the strength of the euro. What is your message to them? And do you think that the euro is correctly overvalued? In answer to your first question, the EONIA is the product of market functioning and I am not surprised that it is quite close to the deposit rate, given the level of liquidity that is in the market. We will see what happens. In any case, a number of observers are noting that, owing to our past decisions, in particular those associated with the 12-month operations, liquidity will be abundant for a number of months. As long as this liquidity is abundant, it is not surprising that the EONIA is close to the deposit rate. As regards exchange rates, I would say, that I fully support and share what Ben Bernanke has said on a number of occasions, namely that a strong dollar that will inspire confidence is important for the interests of the US economy. This is also the opinion of Tim Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury. We are running a currency for 16 countries. Since the very beginning, we have had countries that have been in a situation in which they have had to adjust and regain the competitiveness that they had lost. In 1999, some countries had it very easy in terms of competitiveness, whereas others had only progressed so far in terms of their own structural reform programmes. Thus, for us this is the permanent situation, which we are having, to run the single currency for 330 million citizens across 16 countries. At the moment, it is clear that there are some countries that have done a lot of good work in terms of structural reform and others that still have a lot to do if they want to improve their growth potential. Structural reforms are of the essence in order to elevate the growth potential of the euro area as a whole and of a number of economies in the euro area in particular. It is also clear that a number of countries, for example Greece and Ireland have to engage in a decisive strategy that would reinforce competitiveness, as well as generate growth and jobs. We operate in very much the same way as the Federal Reserve System, with our large set of countries, and each time that we have looked at various indicators such as growth, inflation, unit labour cost evolution, in Europe and compared these with the United States, we have found more or less the same order of magnitude of standard deviation. This therefore seems to be the characteristic of a very vast single economy of more than 300 million citizens. Let me only say that what I have seen coming from Ireland has been quite impressive in terms of adjusting to new circumstances without losing time and not hesitating to take the kind of bold and courageous decisions I have mentioned in order to put the economy back on its feet. These are very difficult and demanding circumstances. Without giving details, what I have seen until now seems to me to be going in the right direction. Second question: You mentioned the European Union’s 2020 strategy and I understand your response will be given at a later date. Do you have any ideas for how the 2020 strategy can be made more effective than the Lisbon strategy? There has been a proposal of sanctions which has been rejected already. How would you go about making sure the strategy works? And thirdly, you talked about EONIA and short-term market interest rates. I am confused about how this all would work and your thinking on this. I know you try to distinguish between monetary policy and aid for the financial markets. When it comes to bringing market interest rates back up to the main policy rate – which it is expected you would do in the course of this year, maybe after April once you end the unlimited or full allotment procedure – will that be only done in line with developments and improvements in financial markets or will that also be part of your monetary policy strategy? First, we have to get this into perspective. If I am not mistaken, the order of magnitude of the percentage of Greek GDP in terms of the euro area is approximately between 2.5% and 3%. This should be borne in mind, compared with the share of California for instance, in the overall GDP of the USA. Second, speaking very cautiously, I think that the consolidated deficit for the euro area as a whole is between 6.5% and 7%. This should also be compared with the deficits on the other side of the Atlantic. It is a significant challenge, one which we experience as a single market with a single currency, but it has to be placed in perspective when considering the vulnerability of the euro area overall. All that being said each country has to do their job in their own interests. And the problem is not to get help; the problem is to help oneself. That is clear and I think the message is easily understandable. As regards the 2020 strategy, we have to recognise that the Lisbon strategy was not implemented in an appropriate way, despite the fact that the executive branches gave their full commitment to it each time that there were meetings at every level. In my opinion, we have to improve not the goals, but how they are implemented. Peer surveillance must function much more efficiently than it has done. Using best practices as a benchmark seems to be the obvious thing to do when you look at the European Union. It is natural to look at friends that have done well in various domains and to take advantage of their efficiency and effectiveness by doing the same. I therefore expect a lot from very precise, attentive benchmarking, with the full commitment of the European Commission and governments. We will try to help as much as possible ourselves, and it is obvious that we could do much better if we were to improve our structural position, which gives us a very powerful motivation. With regard to your third question, I will only say that the EONIA was affected by the way in which we handled our supply of liquidity on the back of the exceptional circumstances during the crisis. The way in which we supplied liquidity, in particular the fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment, pushed the overnight rates close to the lowest point in the corridor, namely the deposit rate. As I have already said, it is obvious that this would be the case. We accept it fully. It is part of market functioning and we consider it to be fully in line with our monetary policy. When we change the way in which we handle liquidity, there will be a change in the position of the EONIA in the corridor, which is defined by the interest rates of the marginal lending and of the deposit facilities, with the main refinancing operations in between. My response would be the following: First comment: it is very important that banking supervision be independent from the government. This is part of the core principles of Basel. It was one of the main conclusions of the Asian crisis, in which it became clear that a lot of economies and countries had banking supervision that was under permanent political influences and the result of this was not good. Second comment: Governments are of course in a very important position of responsibility, particularly in times of crisis, because they are responsible for taxpayers’ money. And in the most recent period of crisis, they had – unfortunately - to play a very important role in this respect. It is not to say that governments do not have immense responsibilities, but banking supervision itself must be executed by very serious independent institutions, whether it is carried out by the central bank or close to the central bank. Third comment: banking supervision is organised in all possible ways in industrialised countries and the rest of the world. In some cases, it is totally out of the sphere of central banks and in others there is a very close link between the central bank and banking supervision. Even inside the euro area, there are a lot of different concepts. Nevertheless, the Governing Council of the ECB has always said publicly that we trust that it is better to have a close relationship between the central bank and banking supervision. It has been the position of the Governing Council of the ECB - we made that public and it has not changed. We do not pronounce on whether or not it should be the concept applied in Italy, Spain, France or possibly Germany or, tomorrow, in other countries in the European Union, but only that there should be a close relationship. It in any case goes without saying that central banks have to be independent, particularly in view of the Maastricht Treaty, which gives central banks fierce independence vis-à-vis the political sphere. As I have already said, we consider it appropriate that there is a close relationship between the central bank and banking supervision, which appears to be a growing trend at the moment also in Belgium and Germany. We will see what happens in other countries. If taxpayers’ money is at stake, then it goes without saying that the involvement of the government is absolutely necessary. If decisions that are not involving taxpayers’ money are taken, it has to be the supervisory authority. You could well imagine that you would separate the function of the central bank and that of the supervisory authority in a very appropriate fashion. A number of institutions do this. I have nothing against the approach of the German government. It must be carefully monitored how this will work in practical terms. Of course, it is essential to fully respect the independence of the board of the central bank. I will also say again that you should never confuse the role of the supervisory authority with the involvement, when unfortunately necessary, of the Treasury. It goes without saying that the Eurosystem also comprises the Bank of Greece and that we are permanently working within the full body of the Eurosystem, in particular of course the countries concerned. Within the limits of our own responsibilities, we will do everything that we can, in technical terms, to help the Greek government to head in the right direction. However, this is primarily the responsibility of the Commission and the EU Council. And more generally, Spain just took over the Presidency of the European Union in January. What are you expecting from this six-month period? I will not give good marks and bad marks to individuals – that is not the way we work here. As regards your second question we, of course, expect a lot from the Presidency of Europe, which is a very important function, together with that of the new President of Europe, Mr van Rompuy. I have to say that all Council meetings with ministers have to work as well as possible. I am sure that the Spanish Presidency is totally dedicated to providing a very good Presidency during these six months, and from what I have seen, it is being taken extremely seriously and handled well by the Spanish government. And, of course, Spain, like the other 16 countries, has homework to do. It was not the legal team of the ECB. It was one individual and there was the usual disclaimer – ( The views expressed in this paper do not necessarily reflect those of the European Central Bank) that it was his opinion and not that of anyone else. I totally disagree ( with some analysis of the paper). I said, on behalf of the Governing Council, that we consider the credibility of the figure to be absolutely essential. And you might have seen that this sentiment is completely and publicly shared by the Commission. It seems to me that the lessons from the past absence of credibility are such that the government in question is getting the message very clearly, but we will see what is being done. It is absolutely crucial. I saw that some kind of decision was about to be taken; Lucas, would you provide further details? Papademos: As the President said, we have just received information about the stability programme, but one positive element of the programme is to confirm the previous announcement about the establishment of an independent national statistical authority. This authority will ensure – and I think this should definitely be the aim – the quality and reliability of fiscal statistics once and for all. What is important is that such authority will function in full independence and that it will ensure that statistics will be complete, reliable and provided in a timely manner. Implementation is key!
