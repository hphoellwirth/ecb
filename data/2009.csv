03/12/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference today. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 5 November 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information also confirms the expected improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year, with euro area real GDP growth returning to positive territory in the third quarter of 2009. However, some of the factors supporting the recovery at present are of a temporary nature. The Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At today’s meeting we also decided to continue conducting our main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as is needed – and at least until the third maintenance period of 2010 ends on 13 April. We will continue to use this tender procedure in our special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue for at least the first three maintenance periods of 2010. Moreover, we decided that the rate in the last 12-month longer-term refinancing operation, to be allotted on 16 December 2009, will be fixed at the average minimum bid rate of the MROs over the life of this operation. Finally, as regards longer-term refinancing operations in the first quarter of 2010, we decided to carry out the last six-month longer-term refinancing operation on 31 March 2010. This operation will be carried out using a full allotment fixed rate tender procedure, as will the regular monthly three-month longer-term refinancing operations already announced for the first quarter of 2010. Further operational details on these decisions can be found in a press release that will be posted on our website after this press conference. The improved conditions in financial markets have indicated that not all our liquidity measures are needed to the same extent as in the past. With these decisions, the Eurosystem continues to provide liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area for an extended period at very favourable conditions and to facilitate the provision of credit to the euro area economy. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Economic activity in the euro area improved further in the third quarter of 2009, with real GDP growth returning to positive territory following five quarters of contraction. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, real GDP increased by 0.4 % quarter on quarter. Available survey data suggest that the recovery is continuing during the fourth quarter of 2009. At present, the euro area is benefiting from the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature and activity is likely to be affected for some time to come by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and the non-financial sector, both inside and outside the euro area. For this reason, the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010, and the recovery process is likely to be uneven. Eurosystem staff project annual real GDP growth of between -4.1% and -3.9% in 2009, between +0.1% and +1.5% in 2010, and between +0.2% and +2.2% in 2011. The range for 2010 has been revised upwards compared with the September 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the December 2009 Eurosystem staff projections. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve further and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disruptive market movements related to the correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, as expected, euro area annual HICP inflation has turned positive again after five months of negative rates. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, it stood at +0.6% in November, up from -0.1% in October. The rise mainly reflects upward base effects stemming from the drop in global commodity prices a year ago. Inflation is expected to rise further in the near term, mainly owing to upward base effects in the energy and food components. Looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon, with overall price, cost and wage developments staying subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Consistent with this assessment, the December 2009 Eurosystem staff projections foresee annual HICP inflation of 0.3% in 2009, between 0.9% and 1.7% in 2010, and between 0.8% and 2.0% in 2011. Compared with the September 2009 ECB staff projections, the inflation projections for 2010 remain largely unchanged. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. Risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the data for October confirm the ongoing decline in the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector, to 0.3% and -0.8% respectively. These concurrent declines continue to support the assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. At the same time, the annual growth rate of M1 was 11.8% in October 2009, down from 12.8% in September, mainly reflecting a base effect. The current decline in the annual growth rates of monetary aggregates is influenced by a number of special factors and is thereby likely to overstate the deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion. First, base effects associated with the intensification of the financial turmoil in autumn 2008 have had a downward effect on the annual growth rate of M3 in the past two months. Second, and more fundamentally, the steep slope of the yield curve provides an incentive to shift funds out of M3 into longer-term deposits and securities, thereby dampening M3 growth. The current constellation of interest rates also continues to trigger shifts of funds within M3, as the narrow spread between the rates on different short-term deposits reduces the opportunity costs of holding the most liquid assets contained in M1. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector turned somewhat more negative in October. In the case of loans to households, the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates of growth. As regards loans to non-financial corporations, it is worthwhile to note that the growth of loans to enterprises typically picks up with some lag compared with the cycle in economic activity. In this respect, the still subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook, are likely to dampen firms’ demand for bank financing also in the coming months, especially for short-term loans. At the same time, overall financing conditions continue to improve, which should support the demand for loans in the period ahead. Banks are currently faced with the challenge of managing the size and structure of their overall balance sheets, and at the same time ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. Against the background of their improved liquidity situation and access to market financing, banks should address this challenge by taking appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 5 November 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information also confirms the expected improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year, with euro area real GDP growth returning to positive territory in the third quarter of 2009. However, some of the factors supporting the recovery at present are of a temporary nature. The Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. With all the measures we have taken in response to the intensification of the financial crisis, we have supported both the availability of liquidity to the banking sector and the recovery of the euro area economy. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will continue to progressively feed through to the economy. We will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system, while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long. Looking ahead, the Governing Council will gradually phase out, at the appropriate time, the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past. In order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. In this way, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, we re-emphasise how important it is for governments to develop, communicate and implement ambitious fiscal consolidation strategies in a timely manner. These strategies must be based on realistic output growth assumptions and focus on structural expenditure reforms, not least with a view to coping with the budgetary burden associated with an ageing population. As agreed by the ECOFIN Council on 2 December 2009, governments need to set out concrete and quantifiable adjustment measures that will lead to a sustainable correction of fiscal imbalances. Several countries will have to start consolidation in 2010, and all others in 2011 at the latest. With regard to structural reforms, most estimates indicate that the financial crisis has reduced the productive capacity of our economies, and will continue to do so for some time to come. In order to support sustainable growth and employment, labour market flexibility and more effective incentives to work will be needed. Furthermore, policies that enhance competition and innovation are also urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities. An appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should also play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. And the second question, if I may, a lot of times, we have talked about excessive M3 growth or excessive monetary growth, now, of course, there is no such thing, especially M1, very weak, does that point only to a lack of demand for credit, or do we actually have credit crunch scenarios, as many often suggest? On your first point, as you can see, we continue to strongly encourage the governments to take care of their fiscal policies and to go very rapidly back to sustainable finances, in some cases starting in 2010 and in all others in 2011. And this, as we all know, was decided on 2 December 2009 by the ECOFIN. I expect these decisions to be implemented. These are decisions of the governments themselves, and I expect that they will help improve the creditworthiness of the various treasuries concerned. And that is why I consider essential that when governments are confronted by their own responsibilities, they face up to them and go in the right direction. As regards your second question on the monetary aggregates, I confirm that M1 remains quite dynamic, as you might have noted, even if the rate of growth, which is in double figures, is a little bit lower than before. Let me say that we have a number of explanations for why M3 is much less dynamic. I should merely mention that, as regards loans, amongst the counterparts of M3, what is interesting to see is that in October, as in September, we observe some increase in credit outstanding in the form of loans to households. And it is important to note that we also observe this phenomenon in the case of lending for house purchase. Month after month, we see now the same phenomenon of positive increases in loans outstanding to households. As regards loans to non-financial corporations, in our judgement the main issue here is that demand is much less dynamic, which is normal after a very important and deep recession. At the same time, we are doing everything we can, and we call on the commercial banks to do everything that they can, to avoid a supply-of-credit-problem. Again, my message to the commercial banks, on behalf of the Governing Council, is very strong. We are asking banks to do their job, we have helped them considerably ourselves. We are continuing to help them considerably and the governments themselves stepped in very boldly. So, we are expecting them not to create a supply problem. That being said, it is clear that demand is much less dynamic after the recession we have experienced. Let me mention, nevertheless, that when I look at the various durations of the loans to non-financial corporations, I still see a slight positive increase in outstanding credit, in the case of loans over five years. This is something that you do not observe for all the durations of below five years, which explains why, overall, loan outstanding is diminishing. And then my second question: you know, just recently, we have heard that Daimler have decided to start making their C-class cars in the US instead of Germany because of the stronger euro. How concerned are you about the rate of the euro and what can you, as central bankers, do about it? On the first point, I confirm what I just said a moment ago, but also what had been understood before by all observers, namely that the third operation was the last one. It was not the intention of the Governing Council to prolong this operation. As regards the indexed rate that we have decided, it should not be interpreted in any respect as a signal on interest rates. The present interest rates are appropriate. I confirm they are appropriate. It is not at all our intention to modify the way we are handling the money market at the present moment and it is not our intention to increase the EONIA rate. We again consider that the constellation of rates is appropriate. We have also taken into account the fact that we are using the appropriate indexation for this twelve-month period. You remember that, for all those operations, we had said that we could have either fixed rates or another way of dealing with it. We consider that the best way is to be totally neutral. And we have absolutely no signal incorporated in this decision. As regards the euro, you know the extent to which we consider that, particularly with regard to the relationship with the US dollar, we have a very important stake in the US dollar being strong. The position of the US authorities – and I am speaking of the Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, as well as of the chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke – has been clear. I repeat what I have already said: I have noted with the utmost interest what the chairman, my friend Ben Bernanke, said in the Economic Club in New York a few days ago, namely, and I quote: “we are attentive to the implication of changes in the value of the dollar”. I consider this speech to be important. I think this clearly shows you the way I am presently looking at this issue of the relationship between the euro and the dollar. First of all, let me confirm that we were unanimous in considering the interest rates to be appropriate, and all the decisions that were taken as regards the phasing out of the non-conventional measures were taken by consensus, after we had carefully weighed the pros and cons of the various possibilities. And of course, it is a multi-dimensional issue, so you have to look at it very carefully. We decided by consensus on all these issues and we looked at all the possibilities as regards the various refinancing operations. And finally, we consider that what we have decided is neutral and contains absolutely no signal for interest rates. The second question I have relates to the fact that the IMF recently assessed that it is better to exit too late than too early. Do you see a similar attitude emerging among some central banks and if so, how concerned are you that this might lead to new bubbles in the global financial system? As regards the phasing out of the non-conventional measures, these measures remain very substantial, as evidenced by the fact that liquidity will remain abundant for a large number of months to come, so you have to realise what exactly our decision means. That being said, we decided by consensus. We all agreed on the decisions I have mentioned after having carefully weighed the pros and cons for each and every decision. As regards the question of whether or not it is appropriate to have an ex-ante bias regarding the phasing out of the measures – and this is valid for the fiscal policies as well as the support given by governments to the financial sphere and the decisions within our own realm as regards central banks – we should not have an ex-ante bias. We should be perfectly balanced. There are risks associated with acting too early and risks associated with acting too late, and we must balance those risks. And when I say “we”, I mean all of us, including the executive branches and parliaments. We have to be sure that we take the right decisions. If we have an ex-ante bias in one direction or another, we risk missing the point and ultimately, having to cope with great difficulties. One of the clear lessons of the past episode, which was a very difficult period, during which we had to take very bold decisions, is that our duty is to be sure that we are correctly weighing up all of the risks associated with each and every decision we take. So we have no bias. We are maintaining exceptional measures that are extremely generous, as you can see, precisely because we want to be just in our behaviour, and because we do not want to create risk in any area. But we have also specifically chosen the level of phasing out to accompany the fact that the market itself is improving more and more, which was our objective when we took our exceptional decisions, for the large part, a few days after the dramatic events of mid-September last year. Then I have a question to Mr Papademos. In a newspaper article this week, you called for mechanisms to ensure that the macro-prudential recommendations of the Systemic Risk Board will be implemented in an effective and timely manner. You also called for the legal protection of the independence of the ESRB. What is your fear if these claims are not fulfilled?  Regarding your first question, as I just indicated, we believe that the decisions we have taken are appropriate. We do not see any harm for any part of the environment in what we have been doing. I have nothing to add to what I have already said. Let me repeat: we were unanimous in taking our decision. Papademos: As you know, the main tasks of the ESRB will be to identify and assess systemic risks and to issue risk warnings and recommendations in order to address these risks if they are considered to be significant. However, the responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations will rest either with national authorities – supervisory or economic – or, depending on the recommendation, with the European Commission or the European Supervisory Authorities. If the macro-prudential recommendations of the ESRB are not implemented in an effective and timely manner, the mission of the macro-prudential supervision will not be fully accomplished. So, implementation is key. It is absolutely essential that the macro-prudential recommendations are translated into effective action if we are going to accomplish the ultimate objective of the new framework for macro-prudential supervision, which is to prevent or at least to minimise the likelihood of future crises and to strengthen the resilience of the financial system. Mechanisms should be in place to ensure the translation of the macro-prudential recommendations into effective action. On the issue of independence, I think it is very important that the ESRB and the members of the Board perform their tasks in the interest of the Union in order to prevent and mitigate systemic risks. This can be done most effectively if these tasks are carried out in full independence, just as we perform our own tasks at the ECB. The current legal text – the regulation that has been agreed by the Council – provides for this independence. So my point was to underline the importance of ensuring the independence for the Board in carrying out its tasks. If the question was that you were wondering whether this will create a problem for the Governing Council of the ECB, the independence of the Governing Council and of the ECB is guaranteed by the Maastricht Treaty and there can, therefore, be absolutely no influence, in any respect, on our own duty as regards delivering price stability. That is crystal clear. Papademos: And it is also crystal clear that the objectives of the ESRB in no way conflict with the objectives of the ECB. As regards the Eurosystem staff projections, we are very much in agreement with the assessment of the major institutions, so I don’t think there is a significant difference. Perhaps some private sector projections are significantly better, but this is not necessarily the case in general. In any case, we consider that there is still a high level of uncertainty, and we consider the risks to be broadly balanced. The Governing Council considers that the level of uncertainty depends in particular on whether confidence improves further. Let’s not forget that the recession stemmed from a very dramatic evaporation of confidence. As regards risks to the upside the global economy – and therefore foreign trade – could be more dynamic than is presently foreseen or projected. We also have the effects of the policy decisions that have been taken and, as I have said, are not necessarily fully taken into account in the projections because of their lags. But we also have a number of very significant risks on the downside, which are, in our view, balancing the risks on the upside. I would say that the possible increases in oil prices and commodity prices certainly constitute a very large downside risk. We consider that protectionist pressures are still looming, and they would constitute a very adverse element. And you also have the adverse feedback loop between the real sector and the financial sector, taking into account the magnitude of the recession, which could perhaps have been underestimated in the projections. But again, taking everything into account, we have risks that are broadly balanced, together with a high level of uncertainty. We are now in positive territory with a likely bumpy road ahead. Let’s remain alert. And a second, related question: what is your position in the debate on whether the interest rate is the right tool to counteract bubbles? Should it be done by monetary policy or by other instruments? First of all, we have said that interest rates are appropriate. I was very clear on that. We consider that at the moment it is important not to signal anything on interest rates. In that respect, the message from us is clear: we are engaging in the progressive, timely, gradual phasing out of the non-conventional measures and this is something which accompanies and reflects what we are observing in the market. We are not signalling anything in terms of hardening our monetary policy. In taking these decisions we are reflecting the fact that some of the exceptional non-standard measures (i.e. enhanced credit support) that we have implemented in order to cope with an exceptional situation are progressively working and are no more needed. We are accompanying these progressive improvements. That is exactly the way we are looking at it. As regards your second question I cannot elaborate too much on that because it would take a long time, but we believe that our own monetary policy concept, which is based on two pillars (i.e. economic analysis and monetary analysis), allows us – thanks to the monetary analysis and the fact that we have a medium-term definition of price stability – to incorporate elements that are associated with rapid increases in outstanding credit, including the impact on asset inflation, which could itself create inflation through the wealth channel and, if boom is followed by bust, destabilise prices through the deflationary risks that could materialise. So, we are working hard, as you know, on improving our monetary pillar. We consider that our monetary policy concept has proved very robust in the past. I said several times in press conferences at the beginning of 2004 and the end of 2005 that the monetary analysis had been a good guide for us in our interest rate decisions at that times. And my second question was, quite simply, how worried are you about the situation in Greece and the risk of a possible default? Thank you. As regards your first point I said that we decided by consensus on the set of decisions that are dealing with the phasing-out of part of the non-conventional measures. I would say that each of us, each member of the Governing Council, very carefully weighed up the advantages and disadvantages with regard to every possible decision. As regards your question on the one-year refinancing, we could have had a fixed rate, namely the MRO rate, as was done the first two times, we could have had a rate with a margin, as had always been indicated very clearly to the market as being possible; and we had the possibility of having this indexed rate. The Governing Council considered, after due deliberation, that this was the right way to be neutral, not to give a signal on interest rates, either in the direction of loosening our policies or in the direction of hardening our policies. The idea was to have an appropriate way of telling the market, as I already said at the beginning of this press conference, that we are neutral and the present rates are appropriate. As regards the element of caution that you noted in our decisions today, I would say again that it is fully in line with this idea that we have to be gradual and timely. We believe that, taking everything into account – the situation of the market in some respects, perhaps the nervousness of the market – the measures that we took today were exactly the right compromise between the various constraints that we have. So, you have there the illustration of this concept of being gradual and timely. As regards Greece, taking into account the situation that the new government of Greece has to cope with in terms of the fiscal situation in particular, I have confidence and expect that the appropriate decisions will be taken. That is what came out of the last discussion which took place in the Eurogroup and in the ECOFIN Council. I can only say that, taking into account the extreme gravity of the situation, I have confidence that the government of Greece will take the appropriate and absolutely necessary decisions. And second question: how concerned are you about the potential impact of Dubai’s debt problems on European banks? Thank you very much. On the first question, I trust the sincerity of the US authorities, both the sincerity of the Secretary of the Treasury and the sincerity of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. As regards Dubai, I think it is an illustration of the fact that we have nervousness in the market. I do not think we should over-assess the gravity of what is happening in Dubai, but at the same time we have to consider the impact that a relatively modest event had on the market. So, it calls for us to continue to be alert and to work with all the energy that we have, in the various workshops that have been opened through the Financial Stability Board and all the cooperative workshops that exist at the global level and at the European level, to work on increasing the resilience of the financial sphere. It is urgent, and we are totally determined at the ECB and in the Eurosystem to contribute as effectively as possible to this necessary improved resilience of the financial system. I have no particular comment on that. I do not know which banks you were alluding to. It is of course in all of our interests, both the public sector and the private sector, to augment the resilience of institutions, markets and the financial sphere in general of course. How about your trip to China? Do you think it was a productive trip? And do you see any softening in China’s attitude towards the dollar peg? And one more question if I may. You said that you did not want to send a message of loosening monetary policy and that is why you decided to index it. How would having a fixed rate full allotment at the refi rate have signalled a loosening of monetary policy? With regard to your first question, I will say once again that today’s decision on interest rates was unanimous. We did not have a lengthy discussion on this point. We considered interest rates to be appropriate and we were unanimous. On China, I would say that it was very important that we had the opportunity to exchange views in an open and friendly fashion on both sides. We discussed the fundamentals as far as possible, starting very clearly with what we considered ourselves to be in the best interest of all parties concerned. It was an important exchange of views and the Chinese authorities themselves were also very clear on their current stance. After the meeting, I said that China confirmed that it would continue to implement the reforms of the foreign exchange market that had been introduced in 2005, but this should not be over-assessed or over-interpreted in terms of signalling future decisions. I will say again, that it was important that there was such an exchange of views between the authorities of a large economy at the global level like the euro area, in particular the ECB, and the Chinese authorities, responsible for another key economy at the global level, including Governor Zhou Xiaochuan of the People’s Republic Central Bank, with whom we enjoy a very close and confident cooperation. On the last point, I only wanted to indicate that we did not want to change in any respect the current yield curve, and we thought that the best way to do this was to take the decisions that we took today. First of all I have to say that the Polish economy seems to me to have been one of the economies which was the most resilient in the circumstances. This is an element of stability in Europe as a whole and particularly in central and eastern Europe, which is certainly important. Of course, we are in a period of difficulty. All economies have to cope with great difficulty, but the resilience of the Polish economy has been noted by all observers. On the overall strategy of the country, it is up to the country to see how to converge and how to meet the various criteria, with which you are familiar. I would say that, to my knowledge, there is a lot of discussion inside the country on what would be the best as regards your question. I do not want to take the place of the authorities or the public debate in Poland. "
05/11/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference today. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. The incoming information and analyses that have become available since our meeting in early October have confirmed our expectations. While annual HICP inflation was -0.1% in October, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the latest information continues to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. The Governing Council expects the euro area economy in 2010 to recover at a gradual pace, recognising that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Available data and survey-based indicators continue to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. In particular, the euro area should benefit from the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. Taking into account all available information, in the second half of this year, quarterly real GDP growth rates could be back in positive territory. However, uncertainty remains high as a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature. Looking through the volatility of incoming data, the euro area economy is expected to recover at a gradual pace in 2010, as it is likely to be affected over the medium term by the process of ongoing balance sheet adjustment in the financial and the non-financial sector, both inside and outside the euro area. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly, the labour market deterioration may be less marked than previously expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation stood at -0.1% in October, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with -0.3% in September. The current negative inflation rates are in line with previous expectations and reflect mainly movements in global commodity prices over the last year. In the coming months, annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again, also relating to base effects. Thereafter, over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation is expected to remain positive, with overall price and cost developments staying subdued reflecting ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector declined further in September, to 1.8% and -0.3% respectively. These concurrent declines support the assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. In the next few months, the annual growth rates of monetary aggregates will most likely be affected downwards by base effects that are associated with the intensification of the financial turmoil one year ago. More fundamentally, however, the growth of M1 and M3 continues to reflect the current constellation of interest rates. While the narrow spread between the rates on different short-term deposits fosters shifts in the allocation of funds to the most liquid assets contained in M1, the steep slope of the yield curve also encourages such shifts from M3 to longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector turned slightly negative in September, with annual loan growth to both non-financial corporations and households declining further and being negative. At the same time, the monthly flows of loans to households remained positive and even increased, while those of loans to non-financial corporations were negative. In the case of households, the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates. In the case of non-financial corporations, the subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook, continue to dampen firms’ demand for bank financing, a tendency which is likely to prevail in the coming months. In this respect, it is worthwhile to note that the growth of loans to enterprises typically only picks up with some lag compared with the cycle in economic activity. At the same time, the ongoing improvement in financing conditions should support the demand for credit in the period ahead. Against the background of highly demanding challenges, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the current rates remain appropriate. The incoming information and analyses that have become available since our meeting in early October have confirmed our expectations. While annual HICP inflation was -0.1% in October, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the latest information continues to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. The Governing Council expects the euro area economy in 2010 to recover at a gradual pace, recognising that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy. Hence, with all the measures we have taken, monetary policy has been supporting the availability of liquidity and the recovery of the euro area economy. Looking ahead, and taking into account the improved conditions in financial markets, not all our liquidity measures will be needed to the same extent as in the past. Accordingly, the Governing Council will make sure that the extraordinary liquidity measures taken are phased out in a timely and gradual fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term. By so doing, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, many euro area governments are faced with high and sharply rising fiscal imbalances. If not addressed by a clear and credible exit strategy, this could seriously risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances and the economic recovery. The very large government borrowing requirements carry the risk of triggering rapid changes in market sentiment, leading to less favourable medium and long-term interest rates. This in turn would dampen private investment and thereby weaken the foundations for a return to sustained growth. Moreover, high public deficits and debts may complicate the task of the single monetary policy to maintain price stability. The Governing Council therefore calls upon governments to communicate and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions, with a strong focus on expenditure reforms. Tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term, when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre. In this regard, the recent ECOFIN Council conclusions, which call for consolidation to start in 2011 at the latest and to go well beyond the structural benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum, represent the minimum requirement for all euro area countries. The success of fiscal adjustment strategies will also depend crucially on the transparency of the budgetary procedures and the reliability and completeness of government finance statistics. This is an area in which quick and decisive progress is indispensable for the countries concerned and for the euro area as a whole. Turning to structural reforms, in all countries more efforts are crucial to support sustainable growth and employment as it is likely that the financial crisis has affected the productive capacity of our economies. Moderate wage-setting, sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work are required in order to avoid significantly higher structural unemployment over the coming years. Policies that enhance competition and innovation are also urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities. An appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should also play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * And my second question is whether you will add a spread to the December 12-month repo, given that Sveriges Riksbank today raised interest rates on its longer-term loans to wean banks off its repo operations. I was just wondering what the ECB’s thinking on this is? We will have a rendezvous in a month’s time where we will inform you about the decision we will take on the one-year longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO). At this stage, I will only say that I do not think the market is expecting us to prolong the one-year LTRO beyond that which has already been decided, and I will say nothing to discourage this current market sentiment. But the decision will be taken by the Governing Council at its next meeting in one month’s time. As regards your second question, I will not comment on the spread, the indexed rates or the absence of them that we may decide. We will examine the situation next month and make our decision then. And also, there are still concerns in the market that, while financing conditions are improving, there are still some banks that depend on your support for survival. Can you dispel these concerns? First of all, we will tell all banks, as we always have done, that the extremely bold and important enhanced credit support measures we are providing will not continue indefinitely – we have said that from day one. The language I have used regarding a progressive, gradual phasing-out of our non-conventional measures is exactly the same as we have always used. In any case, it will be gradual. As regards your second question at the present moment, I will not say anything more than what I have already said in response to today’s very first question, namely that we will meet in one month’s time. At that point we will make a decision and then you will have the response to your questions, not only on the LTRO, but also on the other measures. As always, when we take a decision, we introduce all parameters to make our judgement on the appropriate measures to be taken. I said that present interest rates were appropriate – we have taken all elements into account to take that decision, including of course the information which comes from the exchange rate. You know our very clear position in this respect: we consider that excessive volatility is adverse from the standpoint of the stability and prosperity of the global economy, and of course of the euro area economy. And we appreciate the statements that are made by the Secretary of the Treasury, by the President, by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve (that is to say by the US authorities) on the fact that a strong dollar, vis-à-vis the euro and vis-à-vis the major floating currencies, is in the interests of the United States of America. And I echo these statements, as they are important in the present circumstances. To complement our message, which is, I have to say, a joint message on behalf of the major floating currencies, with respect to the emerging economy currencies, particularly of Asia, I would say that we consider that an orderly and progressive appreciation of the currencies of the emerging economies, particularly in Asia, and of course the currency of China, vis-à-vis, again, the major floating currencies, is something which would be welcome for the overall prosperity and appropriate rebalancing of the global economy. But this is not new; it is a message that was included in the last G7 communiqué. First of all, we are encouraging the European Commission and the Eurogroup to strictly apply the Stability and Growth Pact. We are in exceptional circumstances, and it is clear that the excessive deficit procedures are generalised. But we have a procedure, we have a joint examination of the situation, we have the recommendation of the European Commission and we have the peer surveillance. And that is something that has to be strictly applied. I echoed what the ECOFIN has said as regards the stepping up of the retrenchment in 2011 at the latest and also the fact that 0.5% was not a sufficient yearly rate of reduction for the structural deficit, in the present circumstances. That is very important. It is a position of the ECOFIN that we consider decisive. We have to understand the situation. If we are not credible – when I say ‘we’ I mean governments and parliaments – as regards the sustainability of the fiscal position in the medium and long term, then a very high price has to be paid. Confidence will be hampered and what we want right now is to improve confidence as much as possible. And the recovery will be hampered by the absence of confidence that would be associated with an absence of credibility on the part of the fiscal policy exit strategy. On top of that, I draw your attention to the cost of refinancing, which depends on the credibility of the strategy. This is something which we have to keep in mind. In practically all cases the signature of the Treasury, even inside the euro area, remains in the eyes of the market the best signature in that particular economy. So if the refinancing of the treasury depends on much higher interest rates then you are hampering most of the private signatures and private entities in the same country. So, good management of fiscal policies is also essential because it permits avoiding the hampering of the financial environment of the whole economy – public sector and private sector. That is the reason why we are so emphatic on this point. We consider that there is absolutely no contradiction between being credible in the medium term as regards sustainable policies, and the recovery itself. It would be a big mistake to consider that there is a contradiction. And of course, you have heard what we are saying in terms of tax alleviation, and what we are saying in terms of optimising the reduction of expenditure. As you know, we do everything that we can for the supply of credit to be as forthcoming as possible. Not only our monetary policy and interest rates, but also the non-standard measures that we have decided upon and which have been extremely bold, are aiming at permitting the banking sector to continue to finance as well as possible the private sector and the economy in general. We see that our bank lending survey signals that the supply constraints are progressively alleviating, fully in line with our policy. The demand issue – and I mentioned that on behalf of the Governing Council a moment ago – remains, of course, an important issue. As everybody knows, the situation of the real economy has been extremely poor over the last quarters, even if we are now seeing stabilisation. Trade has also been diminishing. Inventories have shrunk. So it is not abnormal that we see demand for credit which is less dynamic than before. But we are doing everything that we can ourselves to continue to permit that there is no supply constraint. We call upon the banks – and it is a very strong call that you can find also in this message of the Governing Council – to do whatever is necessary to repair their balance sheets and to be able to do their job, which is to lend to the private sector and to the real economy; to lend to enterprises and to households. As regards the households, I noted that during the last month, and it has been made public, we have seen an augmentation of loans to households, and it was even a little bit more dynamic than the previous month. So we have the feeling on that point that we are seeing something which is somewhat encouraging. That does not change the fact that over 12 months the figure that you have mentioned is negative. The second one is: you have just been talking about the pick-up in monthly flows to households; do you now think we have reached a turning-point in the credit cycle? And the final one is: does the ECB think it would be sensible to bring the EONIA rate back in line with the main policy rate before raising interest rates? On the first question, in the decision we took today we were unanimous. On the second question, as I said, we have loans to households that are slightly more dynamic; monthly flows were positive in September, while they were less positive in August. So this is something that we appreciate of course. Whether it shows a change in the trend and whether we have attained the lowest point and will now be in positive territory month after month, I would remain prudent. But of course this is encouraging. We see a slight acceleration of the positive flows for loans to households month after month. As regards the loans to non-financial corporations, the flows are negative for this month, even if we are still observing the fact that the loans with a maturity of over five years are still positive. But again I am prudent and cautious. I consider that most of these observations come from demand and not from supply constraints. But this does not prevent us from being extremely strong in our message to the financial sector, and to all commercial banks in particular: we think that they still have to do their job as regards the repairing of their balance sheets. We still have in some cases the possibility of using the recapitalisation option that is offered by governments. Banks are far from utilising this option totally, because we are approximately at 60% utilisation of the overall option. So there is possibly room for manoeuvre there. The market now accepts issuance of stocks and shares. Banks can issue stocks and shares on the market and reinforce their capital base. This is also very important. They are making profits now. We call on them to put the profits in reserve and to reinforce through this normal channel their own strength and their own capacity to lend. And of course there is also the issue of bonuses. The more prudent and cautious banks are in this respect, the more they can put aside and reinforce their balance sheets. This is very important. In response to your final question, it is not our intention at all at the moment to change the way the market is functioning. We are satisfied with the present functioning of the market. The EONIA is close to the deposit rate because of the way we are handling liquidity. It is not our intention to change that in the next period of time. And secondly, you have talked about how some of your liquidity measures will not be necessary next year. I guess this subject was discussed today. Could you perhaps give us some idea about the risks that you see in continuing these operations, were they to continue? I imagine that there are worries about bubbles in asset markets or maybe excess profits in the banking sector – perhaps you could tell us what the Governing Council is thinking on that point? Finally, just on your reference to tax cuts, you have this line which you have inserted this time about “tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term, when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre”. Is that a reference to a particularly large euro zone country that recently re-elected its chancellor? First of all, we have noted some improvement in the situation. It is clear that week after week we see indications that are a little bit more encouraging than the previous ones. I cannot anticipate what our next staff projections are likely to be: I will comment on them to you in a month’s time. There is a certain probability that the confirmation provided by these better hard data and soft data will permit us to be a little bit more optimistic. I see that this was the case for the European Commission, and it is the case for a number of private sector organisations. But I remain prudent and cautious. As you have seen, we have had signs that are very encouraging recently, for instance the PMI for services, the manufacturing PMI last Monday and yesterday. Today we have the retail sales figures for September, which are less encouraging. I have always said that we have to be cautious and prudent, and that we probably have a bumpy road ahead of us. So, I think we have to remain cautious, even if there is a probability that we will have confirmation over the last half of this year that we are in positive territory. We will see what next year brings. That chapter has not yet been written. I would say that it depends on our capacity to improve the confidence of households and of enterprises, at the euro area level, but also at the European Union level and at the global level. We try to do all that we can to contribute to this improvement and to this better level of confidence in all constituencies. And I think that the people of Europe know that this is what is driving our decisions. As regards your second question, the risks that are associated with our enhanced credit support measures are those you mentioned. But we concentrate very much, as you know, on the risks to price stability. We consider that the anchoring of inflation expectations has been a major asset for the ECB over this period. A major asset because it permits us to reassure people in the medium and long term, to tell them: “your purchasing power will be protected in the medium and long term”. This is extremely important for confidence, but it also worked extremely well to prevent the materialisation of deflationary risks. We were very happy to have this very solid anchoring, which helped us in the heat of the crisis. We will follow all aspects of the situation very carefully, and of course the market functioning. We will be gradual in our progressive phasing-out. We will do that in a timely and gradual fashion. But again, we will have a rendezvous in a month’s time. As regards your question on the tax cuts: we are transmitting our message on fiscal policy very clearly to all countries of the euro area without exception, including, of course, the particular country that you mentioned – which, by the way, is not necessarily in the worst situation as regards the figures. So we do, of course, have a message for that country as regards tax cuts and the appropriate timing of tax cuts. We also have a strong message for all other countries, including those which have at present worse figures. There are a number of countries for which this is the case. Just to mention big countries, you certainly have France, you certainly have Spain. And we know, of course, that there are also other countries which are in a situation which is even worse. Again, it is an issue for the euro area as a whole, and we have exactly the same message for all, even if not all are in exactly the same situation. They all have to take into account the fact that a credible strategy for medium-term sustainability is absolutely of the essence and in their own interest to foster recovery. And that is something that we will say tirelessly, because I am not sure that it is fully understood that this is part of the necessary condition for the recovery. I responded to that question on one particular country but I don’t want to embark now on a series of questions and answers about individual countries. It was merely to demonstrate that we were not targeting one particular country. I mentioned the other countries only to be sure that not one country in particular is being targeted. The message is for all, and the message for structural reform is also for all. You mentioned structural reforms, we consider them to be a crucial part of our message. One of the lessons of the crisis is that structural reforms are even more of the essence than before the crisis. I have already said what I had to say on that. All the information we have, coming from all surveys including that one, is that we have a solid anchoring of inflation expectations, which I mention as one of our main assets. And the information we are extracting from financial markets, which for a time were signalling some kind of pick-up of the inflation expectations, has now been confirmed as a movement explained by technical factors which is now corrected. So, full confirmation of the solid anchoring of our inflation expectations. *** Let me only say that I am very happy that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, which is now ratified by all. Europe has demonstrated a capacity to surmount an immense difficulty in very demanding times, and this is very heartening from the perspective of one of the institutions of Europe which has had to cope with an exceptionally demanding environment over the past two years. We are heartened by the fact that we have found an appropriate way to get out of this situation. I would like to make special mention of those who prepared the Lisbon Treaty and particularly the members of the European Convention. You may remember we invited Chancellor Schmidt and President Giscard d’Estaing to speak about the birth of the ERM, the birth of the European Monetary System, which permitted, after a number of years, the creation of the euro area. Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, Giuliano Amato and Jean-Luc Dehaene were the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of that Convention. Now Europe has a lot of hard work to do. We have a lot of hard work to do, ourselves. We will strive to continue to be up to our responsibilities and we are happy that the functioning of Europe will be improved in the European Parliament, in the European Commission and in the European Council. "
08/10/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Venice. I would like to thank Governor Draghi for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. The incoming information and analyses since our last meeting in early September have confirmed our previous assessment. While annual HICP inflation was still slightly negative in September, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the latest information further supports our view that the euro area economy is stabilising and is expected to recover at a gradual pace. However, uncertainty remains high. As regards medium to longer-term inflation expectations, they remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to moderate. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. Available survey indicators continue to signal an ongoing stabilisation of economic activity. In particular, the euro area should benefit from a recovery in exports, the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken to restore the functioning of the financial system. In addition, following the substantial negative contributions in the first half of 2009, the inventory cycle is expected to contribute positively to real GDP growth in the second half of the year. However, uncertainty remains high and the volatility in incoming data warrants a cautious interpretation of the available information. Overall, the recovery is expected to remain rather uneven. It will be supported in the short term by a number of temporary factors but is likely to be affected over the medium term by the process of ongoing balance sheet correction in the financial and the non-financial sector of the economy, both inside and outside the euro area. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly, the labour market deterioration may be less marked than previously expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation stood at -0.3% in September, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with -0.2% in August. The current negative inflation rates are in line with previous expectations and reflect largely base effects resulting from the movements in global commodity prices a year ago. Also owing to base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again in the coming months. Thereafter, over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, with overall price and cost developments staying subdued reflecting ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm that developments in broad money and credit growth remain subdued. In August, the annual growth of M3 and loans to the private sector declined further to historically low rates of 2.5% and 0.1% respectively. This parallel deceleration in money and credit growth confirms our previous assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. The ongoing deceleration in annual M3 growth has continued to be accompanied by a strengthening in annual M1 growth, which in August rose further to 13.6%. The strength of M1 reflects the fact that narrower spreads between the rates on different short-term deposits have fostered shifts in the allocation of funds from, in particular, short-term time deposits to overnight deposits. At the same time, the steep slope of the yield curve may have supported shifts from M3 to longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. The overall flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in August. In the case of households, the latest data suggest that the decline in loan growth has been levelling off at low rates of expansion. In the case of non-financial corporations, following a few months of negative flows, the flow of loans was again slightly positive in August. Looking through the volatility in monthly data, loan growth continues to be very subdued. This is in line with the lag that normally prevails between trends in economic activity and developments in loans to enterprises. In this respect, given the subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty with regard to the business outlook, further weak developments in loans to non-financial corporations in the coming months appear likely. At the same time, the ongoing improvement in financing conditions should support the demand for credit in the period ahead. Against the background of highly demanding challenges, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the current rates remain appropriate. The incoming information and analyses since our last meeting in early September have confirmed our previous assessment. While annual HICP inflation was still slightly negative in September, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the latest information further supports our view that the euro area economy is stabilising and is expected to recover at a gradual pace. However, uncertainty remains high. As regards medium to longer-term inflation expectations, they remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to moderate. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, including our latest 12-month longer-term refinancing operation of 30 September, monetary policy is providing strong ongoing support to the economy. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will make sure that the measures taken are unwound in a timely fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term. By so doing, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, the need for ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies is becoming increasingly pressing. It is vital that governments put in place concrete structural measures and convincingly communicate that they are committed to ensuring the sustainability of public finances. Governments should design their consolidation plans in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, ensuring that consolidation starts as soon as possible and at the latest when the recovery takes hold. These plans should also be accompanied by a strengthening of national budgetary frameworks. Consolidation efforts should be stepped up in 2011 and will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum set in the Stability and Growth Pact. In countries with high deficit and/or debt ratios, the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of GDP. In view of the rapidly increasing public expenditure ratios, as well as projected further expenditure pressures owing to higher interest burdens and ageing-related costs, countries’ structural measures should focus on the expenditure side. Turning to structural reforms, in all countries more efforts are crucial to support sustainable growth and employment as it is likely that the financial crisis has affected the productive capacity of our economies. In particular, appropriate wage-setting, sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work are required. At the same time, policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to ensure a sustained recovery. An appropriate restructuring and consolidation of the banking sector should also play an important role. Sound balance sheets, sound risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening the financial soundness of banks and their resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * We have signs of stabilisation. We have signs that, since the second quarter of this year, we have come out of the freefall mode that had characterised two successive quarters at the level of both the global economy and the euro area economy. This calls for uncertainties also to be taken into account – uncertainties that are exceptionally high in the view of the Governing Council. We have to remain alert and we do not declare that the difficulties are over. We believe that we still have to be cautious and to be prudent. We are of the opinion, as I have said, that there are signs of stabilisation. We feel that our current monetary policy and the prevailing level of interest rates are appropriate. This, is the view of the Governing Council. We have come to a judgement today that is very close to the judgement we had a month ago. And then, secondly, are you concerned about the level of the euro, and is there anything you can do about it, other than admire the United States’ strong-dollar policy? As you know – and I am saying this on behalf of the Governing Council – the anchoring of inflation expectations is extremely important to us. We consider it to be essential to enable us to deliver price stability, which is our primary objective. And let me also say that the very solid anchoring of inflation expectations has helped us in both of the directions involved. We were able to avoid the materialisation of deflationary risk in the euro area, because we benefited considerably from the solid anchoring of inflation expectations. In comparison with a number of other economies, we had a more solid anchoring that allowed us to avoid any un-anchoring of inflation expectations. And, in terms of the effectiveness of our own monetary policy action after the crisis, we were helped considerably by the fact that there was no dramatic deterioration of inflation expectations in a downward direction. This anchoring plays an equally important role in avoiding that inflation expectations move upward, which is, of course, something that is also key for a recovery. If we had inflation expectations going upward, this additional spread would be incorporated in the medium and long-term market rates and we would be in a financial environment that would be far more adverse for the recovery we are all aiming for. We are monitoring all the information we receive from the financial markets very carefully: you mentioned the five-years forward on five-years break-even inflation rate. We are also keeping a very close eye on all surveys, those that we undertake ourselves and the surveys that are conducted by the private sector. At the moment, we are of the opinion that, taking into account all aspects, including technical factors, we are maintaining a solid anchoring of inflation expectations. And you can count on the fact that we will continue with great care to ensure that this anchoring remains solid. As regards your question on the dollar and the euro, I would say that where the floating currencies, the major floating currencies, are concerned, we, the Governing Council of the ECB, believe that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and for financial stability. And, as you know, we are in agreement in this respect on both sides of the Atlantic. We will continue to monitor the exchange markets closely and cooperate as appropriate. I would also say that I trust that the statement of the US authorities on the strong-dollar policy is extremely important in the present circumstances. When the Secretary of the Treasury and our friend Ben Bernanke say that a strong dollar is in the interests of the US economy and that they are pursuing a strong-dollar policy, this is a judgement that is obviously very important for us and for the global economy. I also have a second question about your liquidity operations: the amount allotted came down really sharply in the September long-term 12-month operation, but the number of banks participating was still very large. I was wondering whether you regard the sharp drop in the amount allotted as a positive sign, or are you instead concerned about the fact that there are still a large number of banks participating? Also, maybe you can tell us something about the banks participating? What types of bank are they, and are they relevant for the financial system? On your first question, first of all that budget discipline is enshrined in the euro area as a crucial part of the single currency area. The Stability and Growth Pact was the response of the euro area when we were criticised for putting the cart before the horse because we had a single currency but no federal budget or federal institutions. The correct response is that it is true that we do not have a federal institution and we do not have a federal budget, but we do have a framework which ensures coherence as regards fiscal policies inside the single currency area. Second, the sound management of fiscal policies is essential not only because you have to pave the way for your children and grandchildren not to be overburdened by today’s spending, but also because if we want to facilitate the recovery, we have to consolidate and improve confidence for economic agents. Moving towards a sustainable fiscal position at a sustainable pace is a key element of that confidence – and thus of the recovery. This is true for households, which have to play a crucial role in the recovery. It is true for the corporate sector, whether financial or non-financial, and it is true from the perspective of the markets. If you want to facilitate the financial environment necessary for the recovery, you have to convince the markets that you are moving at a sustainable pace towards sound fiscal policies. We have a very good example in the euro area because we have a single currency. So, no elements of spreads are due to the currency. We have different fiscal policies, with differing levels of credibility for those fiscal policies, and we can see the difference in the spreads, which are very important in terms of facilitating the recovery – or not. As far as we are concerned, we will always do whatever is necessary to deliver price stability, whatever the situation. Because it is our primary mandate, and because the people of Europe are calling on us to deliver price stability and be credible in that delivery. So, we will do our job – whatever happens. But it is absolutely clear that for the sake of our economy, for the sake of the sustainability of the recovery, it is extremely important that sound fiscal policies be pursued along the lines that I have just mentioned in the Introductory Statement on behalf of the Governing Council. As regards your question on the recent one-year LTRO, it is clear that the shift from more than €440 billion to around €75 billion was something which we all noted. I will not draw definitive conclusions on that at this stage. It is not too surprising that it was much less than in the first operation, because with the first one-year LTRO we provided liquidity to the market and to commercial banks in very abundant quantities, so they didn’t need an equivalent big amount. On the other hand, it is true that €75 billion might appear to be a sign of stabilisation, and this is the way that most observers have looked at it. Again, I will not draw definitive conclusions. I would only say that I tend to consider that it does indeed signal that money markets are progressively beginning to function more normally again. We continue to monitor the market very carefully. And can I ask the same question to Governor Draghi, and, if you don’t mind, could you answer in Italian for Italian television? I personally think that in the present situation, where we have the most dramatic challenge for global finance and the global economy certainly since the Second World War and perhaps since the 1930s, it is remarkable that we have a global consensus on the methodology between emerging markets and industrialised countries and in the G20 in particular. I have experienced in the past a world where there was strong opposition between the East and the West and the North and the South. Now we are all united both on the methodology and on the avenues of necessary reforms. And this is the very positive outcome of the successive meetings of the G20 with heads of state, ministers and governors, and of the formidable work done by the Financial Stability Board, which Mario is active in steering. The various workshops taking place and the Basel Committee work in particular form part of the global, collective work that is being carried out with an agreed methodology and agreed major courses of action. I was extremely happy that between London and Pittsburgh we were even able to advance a number of elements, including in the Basel Committee that were very important for global reform. So we are all working actively. I am positive about what is being done. Of course, it is commensurate to the challenges and it is not yet time to declare victory because the challenges are still there: we need encouragement and we need to continue to work very actively. And those that are suggesting that it is now almost back to “business as usual” are plain wrong. I know that we share the view with Mario that we must continue working to ensure that global finance and the global economy will become much more resilient than it is at present. Draghi: Well, I was going to say more or less the same thing, because the message is that we want to be able to continue supporting the recovery, which has been rather slow and not very strong. That is the first message. The second message is that we have to try to build a financial system that, from the point of view of the Italian economy and generally speaking, is such that the banks will ultimately be able to finish repairing their balance sheets and which will ensure that the cycle starts up again, so that we will have the freedom to really work properly once more. These are the two messages that stem from Pittsburgh and Gothenburg, which we would also like to pursue following Istanbul. One of the reasons why we say that we have to be very prudent and cautious and why we say that we have a bumpy road ahead of us, even if we are out of this dramatic period of freefall, is unemployment. There is the possibility of unemployment increasing because there are lags. So, even after recovery has begun and positive growth has returned, we might have to cope with an increase in unemployment. This is, of course, part of the reason why we have to be as active as possible in improving confidence, because this scenario is a result of an absence of confidence. And to sum up what the Eurosystem and what the Governing Council of the ECB tries to do, it would be to anchor and consolidate confidence, within our field of responsibility. Confidence has evaporated with the crisis that struck us in mid-September last year and even before then. So, anything we can do to improve confidence is of the essence today. Draghi: Could I just add something? The other message that is quite clear is that the international banking and financial system must be increased and improved in such a way that it enables the banks to contribute to this upswing in the economy as a whole. Mr Trichet, in your references to the exchange rate you talked about how you would coordinate as appropriate. Might that include joint intervention between the US and the ECB? Secondly, a technical question. You’ve got a calendar of market operations – which, if I am correct, expires at the end of January – setting out your medium and longer-term operations. Can you tell us when that calendar would be renewed – when you would update that calendar for months beyond January next year? And, thirdly, just a quick question on Latvia. I wonder whether you could comment on the situation on Latvia and whether the risk of contagion is perhaps lower than it was a few month ago. And my question for Mr. Draghi was whether he might just give us an outlook for the Italian economy and whether the outlook might be affected by recent political and legal events, here, in Italy. As regards the first question, I said – and we are saying on both sides of the Atlantic – that we cooperate as appropriate. I stick to that, and as you know, you will never have any comments from me on the intervention concept. If we have anything to communicate we will do so. But I don’t comment in any respect. As regards your second question, we will see what we say exactly when the time comes, as we have done in the past. I will not comment in advance. We will again communicate, at the moment that is appropriate for the market to have a full understanding, on the future of such operations, if any. On Latvia, we did not discuss this issue at all at this Governing Council meeting and so I have no particular comments at this stage. I stick to what we have already said, particularly as regards the help of the European Community and the help of the IMF. Draghi: As regards your question on the economic outlook for Italy, it’s a short answer: no change in the economic outlook as a result of recent political events. First, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council – loans to non-financial corporates are, over twelve months, slightly positive. When I look more carefully at loans to non-financial corporates, I see an increase of 5% in the loans of over 5 years and quite a substantial fall in the loans that are of 0-1 year – -8.9% in the latest statistics for August. This calls for a better understanding of what exactly is happening in this duration of loans. It is absolutely clear that our non-standard measures have been designed to facilitate credit – the loans and the financing of the private sector of the real economy – as much as possible. Had we not done all that we have been doing we would be in a totally different situation, so that is something which has to be noted. We also call for the banks to take advantage of all possibilities in terms of improving their balance sheets in order to be able to finance the real economy as well as possible. This is important; it is a message that is again one of the messages of the Governing Council. It was the same last time. And I see that now in the euro area there are a number of issuances of new capital. I think it’s an important sign, and we should certainly encourage this as much as possible. On the financing of the real economy, I would also mention the survey on Small and Medium Enterprises, (SMEs) in particular, which helped us gain a sense of what they were feeling themselves when they asked for financing. You will remember that in the findings we published, 77% of the SMEs surveyed said that they had a positive response from their banks when they’d asked for financing and only a very meagre proportion received a fully negative response. But that said, it’s clear that, given the contraction of the economy, the demand for credit is much less buoyant than it was before. So, we have to disentangle supply and demand. In short, everything we do, particularly with our standard and non-standard monetary policy measures, we do to avoid supply constraints. We also call on banks to contribute actively to avoid these supply constraints. What is done by governments is considerable. What is done by us is considerable. It is justified only because we want banks to do their job and to finance the real economy; otherwise we wouldn’t do all that we are doing. That’s absolutely clear. They should also be up to the responsibility they have at present. I would say that your reference, which is a reference to Secretary Connally, many, many years ago does not correspond at all to the present situation. I mentioned what was said by the Secretary of the Treasury and I said that I appreciated that as being a very important element in the present overall situation. I will not comment more on the exchange rate. On the oil and commodity price, I have mentioned this as an element of uncertainty in the present circumstances, which is a risk for inflation in particular and for the economy. If the price of oil and commodities is going up we have both risks, indeed the worst possible risk, that is to say a risk of falling growth and rising inflation. So all that can be done to stabilise those markets, through more transparency, and more visibility in the markets concerned. Behaving responsibly for all, whether producers or consumers is extremely important in the present conjuncture. And on my second question I would like to ask if the next long term refinancing operation in December, will that be also at the current rate or are you considering to introduce a spread? On your second question: we will tell you when the time comes what we will do in December. As for the first question, I have already responded to it and I have no further comments to make. And secondly if you could comment on the possibility that monetary policy can remain accommodative longer if governments comply with your call to reduce fiscal stimulus in 2011? On your first question: We were unanimous. On your second question, we always make our decisions according to the situation we are in, taking into account, all elements: fiscal policies, the situation of the economy, the situation of all parameters that are pertinent. This is because we must deliver price stability, be credible in that delivery and anchor inflation expectations, which is good for growth, good for the recovery, good for avoiding deflationary pressures and, furthermore, good for the financial environment. So we are very clear about that. Whatever happens we will do what is necessary. In addition, we encourage governments very strongly, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, to be as sound, reasonable and credible as possible, because again it is their way of reinforcing confidence and ensuring that their own financial environment is as good as possible. In each country, the Treasury’s signature is a benchmark for all other signatures. At least that is what one observes generally, although not necessarily in absolutely all cases. And of course it is the responsibility of the executive branch and parliament to be as credible as possible, in order to facilitate the financing of their own economy; not only the financing of the treasury, but the financing of all other entities – including private entities – in the economy. Draghi: As I have said, we have a President and he could not be better. And the second and last question: would you like to see the euro become the official currency for commodities trading? On your first question, I would say that coordination, when it is suggested very strongly by the European Commission, as it has been in a number of cases, means coordination between governments, and you might have heard Commissioner Almunia being very clear on that both in Istanbul and in Gothenburg recently. And I think it is true that we need coordination between executive branches in those circumstances. The domain in which it is particularly clear where we need coordination is support to the financial sector, which is being given by various governments in various ways – recapitalisation, guarantees and so forth – to ensure that we continue to have an appropriate level playing field. It is important that this is coordinated, and it is indeed being coordinated very well. We have contributed: the Vice-President in particular has contributed by steering task forces for this level playing field to be maintained, in very close cooperation with the European Commission. As regards your second question on the international role of the euro, I will only say that, since the setting up of the euro, my predecessor and I have always said that we are not campaigning for the international use of the euro. We have no strategy or campaign to foster the international use of the euro and have always said that very clearly. The euro is a currency. The various savers and investors have various possibilities. We are not campaigning for the international use of the euro. "
03/09/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate, taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our last meeting on 6 August 2009. In this respect, at today’s meeting we also decided that the rate for the twelve-month longer-term refinancing operation to be allotted on 30 September 2009 will be the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations. This decision, which continues to guarantee liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area for an extended period of time at very favourable conditions, should promote the extension of credit to the euro area economy and, therefore, further underpin its recovery. Price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. Annual HICP inflation was slightly negative in August according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. This reflects mainly the base effects of the strong rise in commodity prices in 2008. The return of HICP inflation to moderate positive rates is expected within the coming months. At the same time, the latest information supports our view that there are increasing signs of stabilisation in economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere. This is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilisation and very gradual recovery. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the strong negative growth rates observed around the turn of the year, according to Eurostat’s first estimate, economic activity in the euro area declined only slightly in the second quarter of 2009, contracting by 0.1% compared with the previous quarter. Survey indicators for the third quarter of 2009 support the view that the euro area economy is stabilising further. In the near term, the euro area should continue to benefit from a recovery in exports, the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system. In addition, the inventory cycle is expected to contribute positively. However, uncertainty remains high and the persistent volatility in incoming data warrants a cautious interpretation of available information. Overall, the recovery is expected to be rather uneven, given the temporary nature of some of the supporting factors and the ongoing balance sheet correction in the financial and non-financial sectors of the economy, both inside and outside the euro area. This assessment is broadly in line with the September 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. According to these projections, average annual real GDP growth will range between -4.4% and -3.8% in 2009 and between -0.5% and +0.9% in 2010. Compared with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, this implies an upward revision of the ranges for both 2009 and 2010, reflecting mainly the recent, more positive developments and information. Forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the September 2009 ECB staff projections. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly, labour market deterioration may be less marked than currently expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the still strained financial markets, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and a disorderly correction of global imbalances. At the same time, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook remains higher than usual. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, -0.2% in August , compared with -0.7% in July. This development is in line with previous expectations and reflects largely base effects resulting from the movements in global commodity prices a year ago. Owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again within the coming months. Looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, with overall price and cost developments staying subdued in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to re-emphasise that the indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This outlook is consistent with the September 2009 ECB staff projections for euro area inflation. In these projections, annual HICP inflation is projected to range between 0.2% and 0.6% in 2009 and between 0.8% and 1.6% in 2010, revised slightly upwards from the June 2009 Eurosystem staff projections, reflecting mainly upward revisions to energy prices. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to higher than expected commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm a continued deceleration in both broad money and credit growth. In July, the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector declined further to 3.0% and 0.6% respectively, reaching new lows since 1999. These developments support the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. The short-term developments of M3 and its components have remained volatile. The recent changes in interest rates paid on the different instruments included in M3 have continued to underlie the strong shifts in the allocation of funds from, in particular, short-term time deposits to overnight deposits. The deceleration in annual M3 growth has thus continued to combine with a substantial further strengthening of annual M1 growth, which in July rose to 12.1%. In addition, the relatively steep yield curve and the re-emergence of risk appetite, reflected particularly in the increase in stock prices over the past few months, may have dampened M3 growth to some extent. The overall flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in July, with the differences across borrowing sectors becoming more marked. The flow of loans to households remained slightly positive, whereas in the case of non-financial corporations the flow of loans was negative again. The decline in loans to non-financial corporations continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity, while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive. The fall in production and trade and the ongoing uncertainty in the business outlook are likely to have dampened firms’ demand for financing. Given the normal lag between a recovery in economic activity and a pick-up in loans to enterprises, further weak developments in loans to non-financial corporations in the coming months appear likely. At the same time, a gradual improvement in financing conditions, as lower market interest rates continue to be passed on in lower bank lending rates, should support the demand for credit in the period ahead. Against the background of highly demanding challenges, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 6 August 2009 confirms the view of the Governing Council that the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. In this respect, at today’s meeting we also decided that the rate for the twelve-month longer-term refinancing operation to be allotted on 30 September 2009 will be the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations. Price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. Annual HICP inflation was slightly negative in August. This reflects mainly the base effects of the strong rise in commodity prices in 2008. The return of HICP inflation to moderate positive rates is expected within the coming months. At the same time, the latest information supports our view that there are increasing signs of stabilisation in economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere. This is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilisation and very gradual recovery . Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy is providing ongoing support for households and corporations. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will make sure that the measures taken are unwound in a timely fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term. By so doing, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, the latest quarterly euro area data and developments in individual countries confirm a substantial deterioration of fiscal positions in 2009, which is projected to continue in 2010. In finalising their 2010 budgets and medium-term fiscal plans, governments must now substantiate their commitment to ensuring a swift return to sound and sustainable public finances in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, it is crucial that ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies, underpinned by concrete structural measures, are put in place. The structural adjustment process should start, in any case, not later than the economic recovery and the consolidation efforts should be stepped up in 2011. Structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum set in the Stability and Growth Pact. In countries with high deficits and/or debt ratios, the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of GDP. The focus of the structural measures should lie on the expenditure side, as in most euro area countries tax and social contribution rates are already high. Turning to structural policies, it is likely that the financial crisis will affect the growth potential in the euro area. This outlook reinforces the need to strengthen reform efforts to support sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. It requires, in particular, appropriate wage-setting, sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work. At the same time, policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to ensure a sustained recovery. In this respect, an appropriate restructuring and consolidation of the banking sector plays an important role. Sound balance sheets, solid risk management, and transparent and robust business models are key to strengthening the financial soundness of banks and their resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * And my second question is: was the idea of applying a spread on the 12-month operation for December on today’s agenda? And what did you discuss on this point? And my third question is: you have repeatedly said that the 1% interest rate level does not necessarily mean that you could go lower; do you still stick to this message? First of all, let me mention that we were unanimous in judging that the present interest rates are appropriate. Second, we have no pre-commitment in any respect. You know pretty well the principle on which our monetary policy decisions are based: no pre-commitments. As I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, at the moment interest rates are appropriate. We have also taken a decision for the 30 September longer-term refinancing operations. This decision is for 30th September. I give you a rendez-vous for future possible decisions when the time comes. On your third question, I have nothing to add to what I have already said. There is no change in any respect our position. But let me only underline that today we have decided that 1% was appropriate and we were unanimous in our decision. Nothing has changed in comparison with what I have said in the previous press conferences. You know that we have always insisted on the fact that our non-conventional measures – our enhanced credit support measures – have been technically designed to permit an easy exit. They are constructed to permit that. And I trust that because everybody sees that they have been technically designed for an easy exit when the time comes, we have continued to anchor very well inflation expectations in the medium and long term in particular. All that I can say is that today is not the time to exit. But again, we are alert, we are permanently looking at the situation and we are making judgements on the basis of our analysis. The second question is: Some Governing Council members have said that the ECB will not start unwinding its current policies before financial markets appear stable enough. I was wondering how you will discern whether they are stable enough and if there are any specific criteria you are looking out for. And finally, there have recently been a lot of warnings on the health of the banking system and the ongoing reluctance to lend. I am wondering whether these warnings come in reaction to what the ECB considers undue optimism, or whether it is actually banks’ failure to recapitalise up until now that has increased your concerns? Let me mention that the Governing Council has noted some figures that were better than expected – in particular as regards surveys, but also some hard figures – and has also noted that our staff were suggesting that the previous projections be revised upwards somewhat. That being said, the sentiment of the Governing Council is that prudence and caution are of the essence in the present situation. We see that uncertainty, as I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, is very high, and we have to be fully aware of that. We probably have a bumpy road ahead of us, taking into account the full complexity of the situation and, again, the fact that uncertainty is high. If I have a message on behalf of the Governing Council, it is that prudence and caution are still of the essence. As regards the unwinding of the present non-conventional measures as well as the unwinding of conventional measures, namely interest rates, as I have just said, we consider that everything we have decided has been technically designed to allow an easy exit. We will see – when the time comes; it is not time today – what is appropriate in terms of utilising the various tools that we have introduced. As I have already said, we are not pre-committed to exiting the long-term operations before increasing interest rates, or vice versa. We are free to do what we judge the most appropriate when the time comes. As regards lending, we are permanently telling the commercial banks that enormous amounts of effort have been made by us in terms of exceptional measures. Governments have themselves taken decisions that are important and exceptional in terms of the support provided to the financial sector and banks, and we expect banks to be fully aware of that. We do not want a centralised or administrative economy, but we call on banks to be fully responsible and fully aware of their responsibility, which is to finance the real economy. Again, as I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, they should do whatever is necessary in order to reinforce their capital base – including, of course, taking advantage of the possibilities offered by public authorities. These possibilities, in particular, have by far not been fully utilised. I do not want to comment on the specific decisions or intentions of any particular government. The only thing I would say is that, indeed, governments and parliaments have themselves also stepped in. Again, when I add up all the risk – the risk to taxpayers – that has been put on the table after the intensification of the crisis in mid-September 2008, when you look at the option of recapitalisation, the option of guarantees of all kinds, including for medium-term refinancing, the option of impaired assets in a number of cases and so on, we end up with an enormous amount of public money – public risk. So, governments have stepped in, and this was necessary in these circumstances. And as regards central banks, I do not want to comment on what the other central banks are doing. We have all taken exceptional measures and observers are – I think – looking at what we have been doing and what we are continuing to do and are very impressed by the non-conventional measures that we all have taken. It is a decision which, as you remember, was taken by the G20 and is now being implemented. I would say it is of the same nature as the extraordinary decisions taken by both central banks and governments in terms of non-conventional measures of extreme audacity and magnitude. These were necessary in order to avoid the meltdown of the global financial system and national finance sectors that were under extraordinary stress, after the intensification of the crisis. Of course they will have to be unwound when the time comes. So I would give you exactly the same response at the global level as I gave with regard to the enhanced credit support that we ourselves are providing. It is important that the fiscal policies, which were justified as extraordinary measures given the gravity of the circumstances, should also have an exit strategy in view. At the national level, the continental level and at the global level, for the central banks on the one hand and the governments on the other hand, the exit strategy is very important for confidence. By providing the prospect of returning to a sustainable mode of functioning of the global, national and continental economies, we would improve confidence and, then, facilitate the recovery. And I think we can never insist sufficiently on the key factor that is confidence. The second question is how concerned are you that the current excess liquidity floating around in the world financial system might lead to inflationary pressures in the medium and longer term? As regards growth next year, which will of course also be influenced by growth this year since we have the carry-over, uncertainty remains a major factor. If I take the most recent projections for 2010 made by our staff, we are in a range of between -0.5% and 0.9%. The mid-point is slightly positive. The range shows that there is a large degree of uncertainty and so prudence and caution are of the essence. We have to remain prudent. As regards excess liquidity, we designed the non-conventional measures in such a way that we would have all of the means necessary for withdrawing the excess liquidity when the time comes and we are permanently alert and permanently analysing the situation. Alertness is one of our major principles. So today it’s clearly not the time. When it is time, we will do it. And the second question: in your statement discussing growth prospects, you stressed how the euro area would benefit from a recovery in exports. Could you give us your view on growth prospects in other major world economic regions – ­I’m thinking of the United States and Asia – whether you see a rebound there comparable with that of the euro area, better or not as strong? On your first point, I think one has to examine very carefully exactly what happens in terms of providing liquidity on the one hand and utilisation of the deposit facility on the other hand. It is not obvious, that the same institutions are doing both, taking the liquidity and replacing the liquidity in the deposit facility of the Eurosystem. It might very well be, in a large majority of cases, that these are not the same institutions. In our eyes, as is of course also confirmed by today’s decision of the Governing Council, the 12-month LTRO has been a success. It might be that a significant number of institutions are themselves without any liquidity needs, are not asking for liquidity to the central bank and for a variety of reasons are replacing their own excess of liquidity in the deposit facility. So a too simple analysis which relies upon the working assumption that the same institution does both – asking for liquidity and replacing in the central bank - does not seem to be right; it is more complex than that. Of course, it also demonstrates that we still have to make a lot of effort to get our money market totally back on its feet because it proves that the market is still not functioning appropriately. It is not our intention to change our deposit rate and we consider that what has been done elsewhere is within a context which is very different from ours with regard to the handling of the money market. So I do not consider that this is something we should look at now. As regards the global economy, we see elements that are clearly positive in emerging Asia in particular, and in Brazil, to quote one particular emerging country that is currently experiencing significant dynamism. We have also seen the new hard and soft data in the United States and this is an important part of the overall global picture. But even at the global level, prudence and caution remain of the essence for a number of reasons, certainly including the fact that we have this permanent adverse feedback loop between the real economy’s previous free fall and the financial sector. But also because we have the question mark regarding the price of oil as well as the price of commodities and, in addition, the temptation of protectionism is real. Let me stress as done in the past that we are very strongly calling for a successful conclusion of the Doha round. One of the most important elements for giving the global picture a much better colour would be to achieve this negotiation. That would certainly be important. We will see exactly how the London meeting goes at the level of ministers and governors – I believe that previous decisions taken by and the strategy previously defined at the level of the G20 ministers and governors and at the level of Heads of State and Government, has been effective. Again, we had to cope with the threat of a meltdown of world finance and of the global economy. We had to cope with a period of perhaps two quarters or seven months of a free-fall in the global economic activity, as well as in each individual economy. We were able to observe this in the euro area in the final quarter of last year and in the first quarter of this year. The overall decisions and orientations, taken by the G20 have made it possible, on the basis of a broad consensus at the global level, to avoid the materialisation of these threats that were extremely dangerous. But that having been said, a lot of work remains to be done. And, as we said prudence and caution are of the essence. We also said that we still have many challenges ahead of us. The worst possible attitude would be to say that, now that we can see that the financial markets are functioning much better again, now that we can see that asset prices are going up again, now that we can see that we have a number of indications of our returning to normal, it can be “business as usual” again. Some are saying: “let us forget about the fragility of global finance and the global real economy that we have had to cope with, because we are now in a “business as usual” world again. All this would be absolutely wrong – simply and plainly wrong! We have to carry on with the job at hand. We have to continue with everything that has been put in place in terms of reinforcing the resilience of global finance. And we all still have a great deal of homework to do. Both surveillance at the global level and the close monitoring of macro-policies have also to be reinforced substantially, because, if we do not do so, we will have only prepared the ground for the next major crisis. Second, I would like to know, since you said that the 12-month tender has been a great success, whether you consider doing more of those, besides the three that you have already announced. And, in general, how long do you think you will be going on with full allotment in your tenders? On the first question, I insist on the fact that, at the level of the central banks – and I think that I am echoing the position of all central banks – we are all united in our purpose, we are united in our endeavours to deliver price stability in the medium- and long-term, and in coping with the threat of inflation and in avoiding the materialisation of deflation in circumstances such as those we are currently experiencing. That having been said, we are all finding ourselves in different situations. We have different economies, we have different shocks to cope with and we have different degrees of flexibility in our economies. Our capacity to anchor expectations differs and we face different levels of threat. We are taking decisions that are appropriate to our respective situations. We have a very strong unity of purpose, and I think that this is very important. I believe that the central banks have played a decisive role in avoiding the catastrophe. And history will say that we most certainly here in Europe – and we trust our colleagues in the other institutions as well – have done so by being able to react very promptly in very difficult circumstances in the recent period. Again, we have not all taken exactly the same decisions, because we are in different situations, which was true in the past and will be the case also in the future. As regards the long-term refinancing, I have nothing to add to what I said earlier. We took a certain decision today and we will see which decision we will take when the time comes for the next 12-month refinancing operations. And as regards the exit strategy, once again, it is not the time for starting it today. In the future we stand ready to do whatever is necessary to permit us to deliver price stability and to firmly anchor inflation expectations. And let me say that, if inflation expectations have been correctly anchored, I believe that this was because the Governing Council is trusted to be able to avoid the materialisation of the risk of deflation in the short term. And it seems to me that this has now been clearly established, even if we always have to remain alert. With regard to the inflationary risk in the longer term, I can reassure our fellow citizens on behalf of the Governing Council. The 330 million people of the euro area can have confidence – we are facing up to our responsibility – we will avoid inflation in the future, in line with our mandate, in line with our primary goal. You can have confidence in that, and I think that this message is important, because confidence is of the essence for the recovery which we will, I hope, be seeing from now on. I would say that it will be a very gradual recovery – as is the judgement of the Governing Council - a very gradual recovery, but confidence is of the essence for this very gradual recovery. I do not exclude, taking into account all the new information that we have had, that we could have, on a quarter–on-quarter basis, a return to positive growth before mid-2010. But nor do I exclude a bumpy road. So, I do not rule out the possibility that we could have positive quarter-on-quarter growth and then a much less flattering evolution in the next quarter. We certainly have a higher probability than before, taking into account what we have seen in the past month, of having positive growth, but again a bumpy road is also pretty possible and we have to be fully aware of that. We have a set of very complex elements. Taking into account the fact that the job of the Governing Council is to make a synthesis on the basis of a multidimensional situation which is extremely complex, we will do whatever is necessary to fulfil our mandate and you can count on us. We trust that, by doing so, we are reinforcing the anchoring of our economy, reinforcing confidence and helping the recovery. "
06/08/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 2 July 2009 confirm our view that the current rates remain appropriate. As anticipated, annual HICP inflation in July fell further into negative territory, reflecting mainly temporary effects. After a return to positive inflation rates during the second half of the year, we continue to expect price developments to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent data releases and survey information still suggest that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak, although the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down. This assessment takes into account adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. Against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. The data and survey information that have become available since our meeting on 2 July 2009 have broadly confirmed our previous expectations. While uncertainty is still high, there are increasingly signs that the global recession is bottoming out. As regards the euro area, recent surveys suggest that the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down. However, economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to remain weak. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected. The significant policy stimuli in all major economic areas should support growth globally, including in the euro area. In the view of the Governing Council, uncertainty remains high and we have to be prepared for ongoing volatility in incoming data. Overall, the risks to this outlook remain balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the turmoil in financial markets, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures, more unfavourable than expected labour market conditions and, lastly, adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, -0.6 % in July, compared with -0.1% in June. This further decline in annual rates of inflation was anticipated and reflects primarily base effects resulting from the peaks observed in global commodity prices a year ago. Looking ahead, owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to remain temporarily in negative territory, before turning positive again later this year. However, such short-term movements are not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Consistent with available forecasts and projections, looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, while price and cost developments are expected to remain subdued in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this respect, indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for inflation are broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to higher than expected commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the ongoing deceleration in broad money and credit growth. The annual growth rates of M3 and of loans to the private sector recorded in June – 3.5% and 1.5% respectively – are the lowest since the start of Stage Three of EMU. These developments support the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. The declining pace of monetary expansion since the last quarter of 2008 continues to be accompanied by volatility in the short-term developments of M3 and its components. This reflects to a large extent the impact that absolute and relative changes in interest rates have had on the allocation of funds between financial investments inside and outside M3 and between the different deposit categories within M3. In this respect, the shift in allocation from short-term time deposits to overnight deposits within M3 has led to a further substantial strengthening of annual M1 growth in June. The flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in June, albeit with differences across borrowing sectors. The flow of loans to non-financial corporations turned substantially more negative owing to a sharp contraction in short-term lending. At the same time, the flow of loans to households was slightly more positive than last month. The ongoing uncertainty seems to have dampened borrowers’ demand for financing. However, according to the latest euro area bank lending survey, lenders tightened their credit standards to a significantly lesser extent. Given the challenges that lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 2 July 2009 confirm the view of the Governing Council that the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. As anticipated, annual HICP inflation in July fell further into negative territory, reflecting mainly temporary effects. After a return to positive inflation rates during the second half of the year, we continue to expect price developments to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent data releases and survey information still suggest that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak, although the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down. This assessment takes into account adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. Against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action should progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, including our covered bond purchases, monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will take care that the measures taken are quickly unwound and that the ample liquidity provided is absorbed. Hence, any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term will be effectively countered in a timely fashion. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, we welcome the position of the Eurogroup that, given the current economic outlook and projected public deficit and debt developments, further fiscal stimulus is not warranted. Budget plans for 2010, which are currently being finalised in a number of countries, and medium-term consolidation strategies must reflect a commitment to a swift return to sound and sustainable public finances. Accordingly, governments should prepare and communicate ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. The structural adjustment process should start, in any case, not later than the economic recovery and in 2011 the consolidation efforts should be stepped up. Structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum set in the Stability and Growth Pact. In countries with high deficits and/or debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of GDP. Given the risks of lower potential economic growth in the euro area for a prolonged period of time, governments should adjust public expenditures appropriately to the new macroeconomic conditions and reverse the sharp rises in public expenditure ratios as soon as possible. This is necessary also to prepare budgets for future ageing-induced expenditure burdens. Turning to structural policies, there is a need to intensify structural reform efforts in order to support sustainable growth in the euro area. Appropriate wage-setting and sufficient flexibility to get the unemployed back into work are crucial to prevent the crisis from having a lasting negative impact on labour markets. It is therefore essential to create appropriate incentives to work. At the same time, policies to speed up restructuring and investment, in line with the principle of an open market economy and free competition, will create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to spark a sustained recovery. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * My second questions is, have you decided today that 1% is the lowest limit, and if not, why not? And my third question is, are you comfortable with the current level of excess liquidity in the system, because banks are still depositing well over €220 billion with the ECB overnight. Would you consider maybe curbing demand at the next 12-month tender, by maybe adding a spread to the rate? On your first point, what we noted in particular was that, as regards the anchoring of inflationary expectations, we had full confirmation of what I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, namely that we had a very solid anchoring of inflationary expectations, particularly on the longer-term basis. The remarkable coincidence between our own definition of price stability – less than, but close to 2% – and the result of the very professional survey remains remarkable. As I have said frequently, we consider that one of our major assets, particularly when I look at central banks the world over, is certainly that we have a very high level of credibility in delivering price stability over time, in line with our definition. On your second point, we did not discuss the issue of whether or not this would be the lowest level. So I have nothing to tell you, except to refer to what I have said on previous occasions when I have been asked this question. There is no change in our previous position. And on your third point, we consider the one-year LTRO a remarkable success. We obtained what we wanted in terms of appropriate impact, particularly on the term money market rates, namely the three-month, the six-month and the one-year money market rates. We see that the demand has been very strong. We have this liquidity which is extremely abundant and we are continuing to observe the situation at this stage, but we have not taken any particular decision associated with this situation. So I have no comment on your last question as to what we will decide. There is nothing that I would like to comment on at this stage. What I have observed, in general, is that the overall mood is, rightly or wrongly, today a little bit better than it was before. And not surprisingly, because there have been a number of surveys that were a little bit better; some hard figures have been better. But as far as we are concerned, we are very prudent and cautious. We consider that we have to take everything into account. We are in an episode in economic history where uncertainty remains very high. I have stressed that several times on behalf of the Governing Council. So we have to remain very prudent and very cautious. I do not exclude bumpy roads. There are elements that are undoubtedly more positive now than they were before. But, again, I do not rule out that we could have contradictory signs and that we could again have confirmation that we are in an economically uncertain episode. I confirm what you have said, that in view of the Governing Council this law’s provisions on the taxation of Banca d’Italia’s gold reserves raise very serious concerns as regards possible infringements of Community law. And, as you have mentioned yourself, we have a negative, an unambiguously negative opinion on this piece of legislation. This is the confirmation of what we have already published. Everybody has to draw appropriate conclusions, but our position is that we have a negative view of the proposed legislation. We judged it as negative. I am not going to embark into details. But, as you have said yourself, there is a commitment not to apply it if we consider it not to be appropriate. So, we will see what happens now. Again our views on this piece of legislation are unambiguously negative. And then also: you said that the bank lending survey showed signs of stabilisation. At the same time, however, a growing number of companies and industry associations have complained about increasing credit constraints, and warned about a credit crunch later in the year. I was wondering whether there was anything you would like to say to those companies and associations to reassure them. On your first point, the order of magnitude that was mentioned here was around 55% utilised, and 45% not yet utilised. The order of magnitude must still be the same and we still feel that there is a case for further recapitalisation. But, as you know, recapitalisation can be done in two ways: it could be done with public money, but it could also be with private money through the issuance of new stocks and shares, as is being observed at a global level. And we would be more than happy if recapitalisation could be undertaken more actively in the euro area and in Europe in general. So, our message remains absolutely the same, telling the financial sector in general that it would be very appropriate to repair the damage as actively as possible and to make it possible for the financial sector and the banks to do their job, which is to lend. And you know that we ourselves have taken very innovative and bold non-standard measures, including that of the one-year refinancing, and expect these to be translated appropriately by the financial sector to the real economy. We tell the banks to do their job, but we have to accept that we are in a market economy. We cannot both tell the banks that in the past they took very abnormal risks, exhibited abnormal behaviour and so forth, and then tell them now to forget about their risk appreciation and their judgement. We have to understand fully how the market economy functions. But taking into account everything that we do, everything that the governments are doing, the extraordinary measures that have been taken, we expect that they will play fully their role in our market economy. This is a very clear message that we have for them. But we do not intend to set ourselves up as a substitute for the banks. The second question is: you mentioned in your statement today, you talked about a return to positive quarterly growth rates next year, you dropped the reference that you had last time to mid-2010, are you hedging and thinking that the pick-up is going to start sooner than you previously expected? On your first question, I will not give you – and you do not expect me to – any precise date. We do everything we can to alleviate what is due to the supply of credit in what we are observing, namely a very strong diminishing of the rate of growth of loans. Last month for the non-financial corporate sector, we were in negative territory over one month, even if we remain slightly positive as regards the one-year statistics. But we see the phenomenon before our eyes. A large part of this phenomenon is certainly due to demand, because we have a very significant slowing down of the economy. We have a slowing down of the investment and the financing that are needed for that purpose. They are much less buoyant than they were before. That is absolutely clear. I do not want to embark on an assessment of precise proportions, but the major part of what we are observing comes from the real economy and the fact that the demand for new credit is less and less dynamic. That being said, there are certainly also supply aspects, and we are as active as possible in trying to understand what can be done to alleviate these supply constraints. From that point of view the bank lending survey offers some comfort, because we observe clearly that the tightening of standards is progressively being alleviated from one survey to the next. So, we see that it is going in a better direction, even if we have to take into account all the tightening that already took place in the past, because the survey tells us where we stand in comparison with the previous survey. But it is going a little bit in the right direction. However, a lot remains to be done in order to have what we would expect, namely only constraints on the demand side, which are of course absolutely and clearly natural. We would like the supply side of the financing not to be a constraint, or as little a constraint as possible. As regards your second point on the profile of growth, I will give you rendezvous at our next meeting, because we will have the new projections and we will be better placed to qualify the staff vision for next year. At this stage, I would only say that we do not exclude the possibility that we could have a profile next year which would be slightly different. I do not exclude that, but we are not in a position to confirm that now. We will see exactly how the work is done. It is work in progress now to be delivered at the beginning of September. So, we will see and do not over-interpret what I have said, the profile could remain very close and in any case uncertainty is unfortunately very high in the present circumstances. And the second question: you mentioned rising commodity prices – what do you think is driving them? And do you think they have potential to drive up headline inflation? And do you think that this might reach a level that unanchors inflation expectations? On the first question let me say, and it will not surprise you, that we appreciate enormously the fact that the US authorities, and particularly the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, are making the point that a strong US dollar is in the interest of the United States. I trust that this is important, and I also confirm that it is our own vision. I should say that this has also been said by the President of the United States of America. On your second point, I do not hide the fact that the volatility of commodity prices is an enormous problem for the global economy, for all economies in the world and certainly also for all central banks in the world. We have to live in an environment which from that standpoint creates a very high level of volatility. I mentioned the peaks and the troughs. We see the impact that it has on the CPI and of course through the CPI on all of the economy and on our fellow citizens, to whom we have promised to deliver price stability. It is not helpful to have these ups and downs, such a rollercoaster in the profile of those prices. Everybody knows that it is an extraordinarily complicated issue. I would say that, at the level of the “Gs” and the meetings of the central bank governors at a global level, this issue of the volatility of commodity prices is one of the major issues where we consider we have a lot of progress to make. First of all, on both sides of the Atlantic, understanding better how the market functions is a major issue. I have observed the debate also on the other side of the Atlantic, which I consider justified. At this stage we have to understand much better the interplay between supply, demand and all the financial aspects of the market. That being said and as you know, we have proved in the recent past as well as since the setting-up of the euro that we guarantee the delivery of price stability in the medium-term and that we are sufficiently credible for the medium-term inflation expectations extracted from surveys or from the financial markets to be in line with our definition of price stability. This solid anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations is our main asset in many respects, a major asset for the ECB, and we will continue to do everything to be sure we maintain that asset. Papademos: The programme has been very successful. It has helped to revive activity in the primary market. It has contributed to a reduction of the spreads. Activity in the secondary market has not increased as much as we would have liked, but I expected that this would be the case. So overall our assessment has been quite positive. The programme will be implemented the way the Governing Council has announced. So what you referred to is just speculation. There is no intention at all to change our decision to go up to the €60 billion. And my second question relates to the lagging indicator of unemployment in the euro zone. It is probably pretty clear that it is going to spike significantly and much of that may have to do with the expiration of the various short-time, partial employment types of programme that simply delay this increase in unemployment and reduction in purchasing power. Would you rank that as one of the more significant uncertainties facing the euro zone economy, because it has tremendous ripple effects in terms of confidence and purchasing power and so forth? On the first question, I would say: no, I have no figure that I would consider pertinent to disentangle the supply and demand constraints that I was mentioning. My suspicion is that demand is certainly playing a much more important role than supply in the present situation where we have had a slowdown of the real economy that has been so dramatic, in particular on the investment side. We have seen recently a survey from the European Commission, which was interesting, where the question was asked “what are the constraints that are explaining the level of your activity?” From the answers given by firms it was obvious that the supply of credit was, I have to say, quite a meagre constraint in comparison with demand for products and services. It was clear that the slowing down of the real economy was explaining very largely the level of activity of the firms and only a very small proportion of the firms mentioned the constraint of the supply of credit. But we know that it is also clear that there are supply constraints and we have to, as I said, look at it very carefully which is what we are doing. What we have published in the monetary aggregate counterparts suggests that the diminishing of short-term credit is very important. If I take the last figures we had in front of us, we had a major diminishing of the monthly flow of credit to non-financial corporations coming from the “up to one year” component of the credit. That is something we are looking at very carefully. But we have also to distinguish between small firms, medium firms and big firms, which are not at all in the same situation. And we have also to take into account the fact that the various financial structures of the various economies that are making up the euro area are not the same and that the distribution of credit is not the same, even if we are making a lot of progress in this dimension. To give you very precise figures, if I look at the loans of up to one year to non-financial corporations, the monthly flow in June 2009 is minus €30 billion, which accounts for almost the totality of what we are observing at the level of the total outstanding amount, which is minus €35 billion. And for the loans over five years, we see that it is only minus €2 billion. This is confirmed by the annual growth rate, where for the loans up to one year we have now minus 5.4%, while we have still plus 5.7% for the loans over five years. These are the figures that we have in front of us and this has to be looked at very carefully. As regards unemployment, which was your second question, I can only say that you are right in mentioning the fact that it is one of the major points which calls for us to be prudent and cautious. It is clear that there are lagged effects in this domain and even when the economy picks up unemployment might continue to grow. We will still have the very great likelihood of figures for employment and unemployment that will not be flattering for a significant period of time. And of course this will have a bearing on the overall mood of the households as well as on the economy as a whole. So this is an element that we have very much in our mind when we are looking at our economy in the period to come, with a medium-term vision. Secondly, the Bank of England has today announced the extension of its quantitative easing programme, although, if I understand it correctly, its assessment of the economy has not changed. Is an extension of your enhanced credit support programme still an option for the ECB? And a third question. Looking at the pass-through of the one-year loans that you injected, you have given quite a lot of analysis of the numbers today. But, am I correct in summarising your thoughts in saying that basically, you haven’t seen any effect yet – no sign yet, at all – that the massive amounts of liquidity you pumped in for one year are being passed beyond the banking system? On your first point again, I would not like to be misinterpreted. I said that we will have a rendezvous on the profile of growth – particularly on the level of the projections for next year by our staff – at our next meeting at the beginning of September. At this stage, I would only say that we have seen a number of indicators – a lot of them “soft” and some, but only a few, “hard” – that confirm what our own understanding of the situation was, namely that the pace of the contraction was slowing down. I said on behalf of the Governing Council that it was “clearly slowing down”. So, that is a fact. But if I have to insist on an element, it would be prudence and caution. Prudence and caution is the main message in this respect. We will see exactly what the new projections are, but at this stage, again prudence and caution. And I would not comment particularly on one economy, because it seems to me that what we are observing in terms of surveys, as well as in terms of soft data and hard data, is by and large in line in the various national economies that make up the euro area. We are in the same environment. The business cycles are close, and even if the amplitude is not the same in all countries, for obvious reasons – but the profiles are very much parallel. So what I say is for the euro area as a whole. As regards the intention that we have, we are satisfied with the measures that we have taken in terms of enhanced credit support, both regarding the LTRO – I mention again that, in the view of the Governing Council, what we have been doing is a success in this respect – and regarding the purchases of covered bonds. We could see the impact that they had on the markets themselves, which we consider – I am being prudent also on this point – had the kind of impact that we were looking for, even if we still have to – if it is possible – improve, in particular, the behaviour of the secondary market. It is not our intention to do anything at the moment I am speaking, unless to apply and implement previous decisions as effectively and professionally as possible. On your last question on the pass-through, what we see clearly is that our reducing of interest rates is having an impact. We are following that very carefully. We see the pass-through in terms of rates and we are quite happy with what has been done so far, even if we consider that progress has still to be made, particularly for some segments of the economy. As regards the volumes, we see what effect there has been. Of course, what we are talking about is quite recent, so we do not expect to see immediate or significant changes in our own figures. After all, my comments refer to the figure for the month of June. We are now at the beginning of August and some of the decisions were taken very recently. So, we will see. We will monitor that very carefully. At this stage, I would only say that the figures we have in front of us in terms of outstanding loans to non-financial corporations, on a twelve-month basis, is +2.8% for June. But as I mentioned a moment ago the most recent evolution is clearly negative. For us, it is clear that a very large part of this comes from the economy, which slowed down very significantly, but we are doing all that we can to alleviate the supply constraints. The second question is on the next one-year tender. You left it open in June in terms of the rate at which it will be issued. Will it be 1% again? This is something that the markets would really like to know. In answer to your second question, the market will find out when the time comes, and I have already responded to this question. We will not change the way in which we operate for such possible spreads, which could be decided for all the term refinancing that we are carrying out. When the time comes you will find out the position of the Governing Council. As regards your first question, the Governing Council does not have a position on the potential rate of growth for the euro area or for Europe as a whole. If we look at the state-of-the-art methodologies for determining the potential growth rate – and the European Commission I believe has published documents in this respect – you see that the most recent observed data have a big influence: you might suddenly discover that the potential rate of growth for a large number of previous years was overestimated at the time the calculations were made. It is therefore not entirely satisfactory to be the prisoner of methodologies that might change significantly past estimates. This is one of the reasons why the Governing Council of the ECB has always been extremely cautious vis-à-vis rules of monetary policy based on estimates of growth potential, because you know in advance that the estimate of potential growth will differ, in some cases very significantly, from the estimates produced in real time. That being said, I fully accept the consensus of economists that the potential growth of all economies of the industrialised world is probably now significantly lower than the previous estimate. This would be true for the United States, for the euro area and for the bulk of the industrialised economies. This is one of the areas in which we have to work very hard from a research and methodology standpoint. We all agree on that and discuss it including with the European Commission, which has made report to the Eurogroup. First of all, we believe it is very important to have an exit strategy, and you heard what I said on behalf of the Governing Council just a moment ago: the Governing Council will ensure that the measures taken are quickly unwound and that the ample liquidity provided is absorbed. This applies to the way in which we are supplying liquidity and the full allotment fixed rate mode which is currently being used. It also applies to the interest rates themselves. We are the master of the rates and we never pre-commit. We are viewed by observers as being one of the central banks which undoubtedly has all the means to implement an effective exit strategy when we believe it to be necessary and appropriate. Our credibility is very strong in this respect and stems from the very solid anchoring of inflation expectations. We are very credible in terms of the exit strategy and there is no public debate on whether or not we will be able to exit. Let me also remind you that we did not hesitate to increase rates when the situation was not that easy, namely mid-2008. This contributes to our credibility today and this is one of the reasons why we have this very solid anchoring of inflation expectations. We are credible, and when we decide that it is appropriate to exit our enhanced credit support programme we have all the appropriate tools and we were very careful not to use any tools or instruments whose effect it would be difficult to unwind. We never pre-commit in any respect on the timing of the various measures that we will take. Certainly no pre-commitment in any respect. We have not taken any decisions yet. We can do whatever we want and whatever we judge to be appropriate, especially in terms of the order in which we do things. I never said on behalf of the Governing Council that we will first unwind all the non-conventional measures that we have taken and then change rates. Our position is clear on this. No. As always we discussed the pros and cons of the situation in many respects and we were unanimous in our decision that the present level is appropriate. "
02/07/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Luxembourg. I would like to thank Governor Mersch for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 June 2009. The fall of annual inflation rates into negative territory in June is in line with previous expectations and reflects mainly temporary effects. After a return to positive inflation rates, we expect price developments to remain dampened over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent data releases and survey information provide further indications that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak but should decline less strongly than was the case in the first quarter of 2009. This assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis corroborates the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit indicators continue to be weak. Against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. The data and survey information that have become available since our last press conference in early June have broadly confirmed our previous expectations. Economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to remain weak but should decline less strongly than was the case in the first quarter of 2009. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010. The significant policy stimuli in all major economic areas should support growth globally, including in the euro area. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to the economic outlook are balanced. On the positive side, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. On the other hand, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the turmoil in financial markets, further increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures, increasingly unfavourable labour markets and, lastly, adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, -0.1 % in June, compared with 0.0% in May. As explained on previous occasions, the further decline in annual rates of inflation was anticipated and reflects primarily base effects resulting from past sharp swings in global commodity prices. Looking ahead, owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to remain temporarily in negative territory over the coming months, before turning positive again. Such short-term movements are not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Consistent with available forecasts and projections, looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, while price and cost developments are expected to remain dampened in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this respect, indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for inflation are broadly balanced. On the downside they relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity, while on the upside they relate to higher than expected commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm a continued deceleration in monetary dynamics. In May, the annual growth rate of M3 declined further to 3.7%, with that of loans to the private sector falling further to 1.8% – the lowest rates since the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. This concurrent deceleration supports the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. In May, the outstanding amounts of most components of M3 showed a contraction, reflecting, to a large extent, the recent declines in interest rates paid on short-term deposits and marketable instruments and the increased allocation of funds to instruments outside M3 that these may have fostered. Following a substantial strengthening in April, the growth of M1, while having remained strong, also moderated in May. The short-term developments in M3 have been volatile over the past few months. Looking beyond this volatility, the pace of monetary expansion has clearly slowed since the last quarter of 2008. The flow of bank loans to non-financial corporations and households has remained subdued, reflecting in part the weakening in economic activity and the continued low levels of business and consumer confidence. A moderate monthly contraction in the outstanding amount of loans to non-financial corporations has been observed over recent months. These developments are mostly due to a decline in short-term lending, while the flow of loans with longer maturities has remained slightly positive. In this respect, it is important to note that past reductions in key ECB rates have continued to be passed on through lending rates to both non-financial corporations and households. The resulting improvement in financing conditions should provide ongoing support for economic activity in the period ahead. However, as we have stressed in the past given the challenges that lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the current rates remain appropriate taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 June 2009. The fall of annual inflation rates into negative territory in June is in line with previous expectations and reflects mainly temporary effects. After a return to positive inflation rates, we expect price developments to remain dampened over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent data releases and survey information provide further indications that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak but should decline less strongly than was the case in the first quarter of 2009. This assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis corroborates the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit indicators continue to be weak. Against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action should progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations. The Governing Council would like to recall that the Eurosystem provided a significant amount of liquidity to euro area banks at its recent first 12-month longer-term refinancing operation. This operation at a fixed interest rate of 1% is expected to strengthen further the liquidity position of banks and to support the normalisation of money markets and the extension of credit to the economy alongside the other measures of enhanced credit support. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will ensure that the measures taken are quickly unwound and that the liquidity provided is absorbed. Hence, any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion. As has been emphasised many times, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the spring 2009 orientations for euro area fiscal policies as agreed by the euro area finance ministers in June. A return to sound, sustainable public finances, thus strengthening overall macroeconomic stability, must be ensured. Against this background, euro area governments should prepare and communicate ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. In the view of the Governing Council, the structural adjustment process should start in any case not later than the economic recovery. In 2011 the consolidation efforts should be stepped up. To correct the envisaged large fiscal imbalances of euro area countries, structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum set in the Stability and Growth Pact. In countries with high deficits and/or debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of GDP. Turning to structural policies, there is a need to intensify efforts to support potential growth in the euro area. Given the negative impact of the financial crisis on employment, investment and the capital stock, it is crucial to accelerate the implementation of necessary structural reforms. In particular, product market reforms are required to foster competition and speed up restructuring and productivity growth. Furthermore, labour market reforms need to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions. At the same time, many of the policy measures taken in recent months with a view to supporting specific segments of the economy should be phased out in a timely manner. It is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy and free competition. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * Second, you are going to have a few more auctions for 12 months over the year, would you consider adding a spread to the ones you are going to have in September and December? And how do you see demand for those two auctions? Third, overnight deposits have come back up to their highest rate since January following the auction. Are you worried that instead of putting this money out into the markets, that banks are just handing it straight back to you? We were happy with the result of this long term refinancing operation. It is symbolic of what we have been doing in terms of enhanced credit support in the domain of liquidity supply, and, in our eyes, the impact of this operation is proof that this is the appropriate channel for our enhanced credit supply. As regards the future auctions, we will decide when the time comes. We have taken no decision as yet, which is not particular to the long-term operation, rather it is the case for all term operations that we decide what to do as regards spreads just before the operation itself. With regard to the functioning of the money markets, taking into account this very large additional supply of liquidity, I would say the following: Since we decided to embark on a “fixed rate full allotment procedure”, namely a few days after the intensification of the crisis, in October last year, we have observed the EONIA positioning itself between the main refinancing rate and the deposit rate. This has been the normal functioning of the money market in the shortest part of the money market since then. This is therefore taken into account in the way we are handling the money market in the present period. We are examining closely how the markets are moving. At this stage, we consider the fact that the EONIA is positioning itself between the main policy rate and the deposit rate to be a normal feature of the money market. We expect this rate to be established by a real private market functioning, i.e. supply and demand of very short-term liquidity by the market participants. We will see whether this kind of normal market functioning continues. We are observing very closely what is going on, but we saw no reason today to change the concept that we have been applying since the beginning of this full allotment mode, which has been systematic since the intensification of the crisis. That said, I am not ruling out anything. Our main aim is to have an appropriate functioning of the money market and to diminish the various risk premia on this market as much as possible. From this point of view, we are very happy because we can clearly see that we have decreased the risk premia. We have seen a number of consequences in the term money market, in particular for the one-year rate where the risk premia are lower than in other equivalent money markets. I would therefore reiterate that our judgement is very positive. However, we will continue to monitor the situation, and we are very keen on having the various market participants setting the EONIA at a level that would reflect an appropriate functioning between market participants. As regards overnight deposits, we will see what happens. Of course, it is not surprising that we have large recourse to deposits when we have a level of liquidity that is obviously significantly larger than that required by the functioning of our own financial sector. The various banks and counterparts of the Eurosystem will adjust to take into account the liquidity situation and we will therefore see what will be precisely the next operation. All operations are with full allotment. I expect of course that the excess of liquidity that we are observing today, which is not surprising given the enormous success of our first one-year operation, will diminish progressively. Also, I was wondering whether there have been any calls for a further rate cut or the expansion of the €60 billion bond purchase programme over the last two days? And also, could you perhaps give us some more details on that programme, particularly as there seems to have been some confusion as regards the maximum maturity of those bonds – is that five years or ten years? And finally, Mr Weber said last week that the ECB will have to bypass the banking system if banks fail to pass on liquidity. Could you let us know under what particular circumstances the ECB might consider such a move? As regards the covered bond purchase programme, we will publish at 5 p.m. CET the legal details of the decision we took today to permit the programme to go on. This concerns details of a technical nature, and we will start this programme on 6 July 2009. As regards the maximum duration of the maturity of those bonds, I draw your attention to the fact that the Governing Council is a single entity with a “porte parole”. Therefore, as regards the duration of these covered bonds, I will stick to what I said earlier, it will depend very much on a case-by-case basis what is the appropriate duration of these covered bonds, but it could go from three years to ten years. As regards the enhanced credit support that we are embarking on – by which I mean both the covered bonds and the liquidity supply, as well as all the measures that we have taken with regard to full allotment and the enlargement of collateral – all this is, in our opinion, appropriate right now. That is true also for the interest rates themselves, and we do not envisage anything at the present moment. Of course, we continue to monitor everything very closely. As regards your first question, namely the functioning of the money market, I already responded at great length on that question. We observe the money market, and at the present moment we consider that what we are observing is explainable, taking into account the very large amount of extra liquidity that we have injected. As I said, we judge this to have been a great success, and we will continue to observe what is going on. Our goal is as it has been the case since the very beginning of these extraordinary measures, to have a money market which really functions, with active participation of market participants and that has been the case until now. At present we do not plan to change our way of handling the money market. On your last point, I never comment on the comments of colleagues. I speak on behalf of the Governing Council, and I said that we had not envisaged any other new measures or operations. We consider that what we are doing now is appropriate. And the second question may be more on a technical note. If you already made the decisions about what’s happening with the covered bond programme, why are we getting a press release at 5 o’clock rather than now? As regards you second question it’s a decision which has to be legally processed. There is absolutely no other reason. As regards the first question it is not new that we see a deceleration of the outstanding amount of credit to non-financial corporations in particular, and also to households. And the decision we just took – and I’m commenting on €440 billion, i.e. the allotment of the one year refinancing operation – was taking into account what we are observing. We are responding by embarking on this new very bold mode of supplying liquidity. We will start the purchase of the covered bonds in a few days. And in our view it is appropriate taking into account what we are observing. Let me remind you of the figures. As regards the annual rate of growth for loans to non-financial corporations, what we are observing is +4.4%. This is the annual rate. It doesn’t capture, as you said, the most recent evolution, which is slightly negative as regards the monthly flow in May for outstanding loans, at -€5 billion. We see clearly that there is a difference, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, between loans over five years, which continue to augment as far as outstanding loans over five years are concerned, and shorter-term loans, which are by contrast declining. So you have a rebalancing within outstanding loans to non-financial corporations. And as regards loans to households, they are flat now over one year. We have in April and in May around zero – -0.2% – from the last statistics. Even if the monthly flow is slightly positive as regards the May statistics. That’s clearly the situation, and the decisions we have taken are exceptional, the results are exceptional because what we have observed with our one-year refinancing operation has never been observed: you have never had the central bank supplying more than €440 billion of liquidity. And we believe that it is commensurate with the challenges that we have. We are also doing it because there is an exit strategy which is very obvious. And when time comes we will be able to unwind this extraordinary mode of supplying liquidity. And secondly, a more general question. You have talked today about policy being appropriate once more, which is now being translated, I think, in the markets as meaning you are basically in a wait-and-see mode. And one of the reasons why demand was so high for the one-year liquidity, as you know, was because markets do not expect any more cuts in the main policy rate and markets are now talking about rates remaining on hold well into next year, possibly beyond. Would you like to say anything today to correct those impressions? We are looking very carefully at all the elements which could permit us to be enlightened on the supply and demand aspects of the credit provision and, taking into account the global decline of activity – particularly in a number of cases the very sharp decline of global trade – we trust that it is not surprising that demand is playing a very important role in the slowing down of credit that we are now seeing. We trust also that there are elements of supply in what we are observing, even if we consider that it is very difficult to disentangle demand and supply. But to the extent that supply is undoubtedly also at stake, it justifies what we have been doing in terms of non-conventional measures. It also justifies our call to commercial banks in general to be up to their responsibilities, namely to ship to the real economy the extraordinary efforts that we are making ourselves. We call for their full responsibility when they provide credit. We also call upon them to take full advantage of the possibilities which are being offered to reinforce their balance sheets. And I am referring to market reinforcement of balance sheets through, in particular, a possible issuance of new capital, which would be subscribed by the private sector. And, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, we call upon them to take advantage of the possibilities, including recapitalisation, which exist at the level of the euro area. We believe that only 55 - 56% of the recapitalisation capital has been utilised. What has been earmarked by the various governments and parliaments contains a non-utilised element, which is of the order of magnitude of more than a hundred billion euros. And that is something which we trust would be very useful in a number of cases. We are not dictating their behaviour, neither to the commercial banks, nor to governments. But we trust that our own efforts have to be accompanied by this support to the financial sector and to the banks, which is part of our joint efforts to revive the economy. That being said, we are observing what is happening and we consider that what we have been doing until now is appropriate and we have now to pursue these efforts. We are starting, as I have said, in a few days the purchase of these covered bonds. And to give you more details we were unanimous in today’s decision as regards the interest rates. I do not change the message I gave two months ago and one month ago. We did not decide today that this was the lowest level we would ever attain under any circumstances. I repeat that, as I did a month ago and two months ago. But we judge that the interest rates are appropriate and we will continue to monitor the situation very closely. My second question is: We had the Financial Stability Review a couple of days ago, and one of the messages was that the banking sector in the euro area is still very vulnerable. Given that fact, you’re providing that banking sector with quite a lot of liquidity – €450 billion – against weaker or worse collateral than before. What does that say about the financial soundness of the ECB’s balance sheet in the coming months? On the covered bonds, all the details of our today’s decision will be published on our website later on at 5 p.m. I can give you a few additional elements immediately. We confirm the targeted nominal amount of €60 billion. We mentioned that we would purchase bonds from eligible counterparties in the primary and secondary markets. We confirm that we will have, as a rule, a minimum issue size of €500 million. In special cases, a Eurosystem central bank may decide to purchase outright covered bonds with an issue size of below €500 million, provided that the issue size is not below €100 million, where it decides, at its own discretion, that specific market circumstances relating to risk management considerations require such a purchase. And the counterparties eligible for the covered bond purchase programme are: domestic counterparties participating in Eurosystem monetary policy operations and other counterparties established in the euro area, either through incorporation or through a branch, that are used by a Eurosystem central bank for the investment of its euro-denominated investment portfolios. This is the information you will find in this decision that I have just signed, following today’s decision by the Governing Council. We will see how exactly the purchases are carried out. For obvious reasons, we would expect to concentrate on what is done for the euro area economy, as the collegial central bank of the euro area – i.e. the Eurosystem. That being said, I know that in some cases you have a small non-euro area element, in some of the assets that are backing the covered bonds, and that would not be a cause for ineligibility. You had a second question. As you know, we recently published figures that were different from the IMF’s figures and significantly lower. When I call for the restructuring of the balance sheets of commercial banks to be as proactive as possible, this is something which seems, to be appropriate considering the challenges that we face. We have a forthcoming collateral framework. That’s absolutely clear, and it is also one of the reasons why we have decided not to take on additional risks associated with the purchase of securities that would increase our risks. I have said explicitly that we believe that this purchase of covered bonds is very much in line with what we are doing with our own refinancing operations, because we have in front of us the signature, backing or guarantee of the counterparties – the commercial banks themselves – plus the collateral in the one case, or the assets covering the bonds in the other. In both cases, we have a double guarantee, which is something that we considered appropriate taking into account the fact that we have a high level of risk, closely related to the fact that we have an accommodating collateral framework. This is fully in line with the need to be careful regarding risks in the Eurosystem. Everything that we have been doing has been designed to facilitate exit strategies. The way that the ECB and the Eurosystem have been operating is fully in line with our fundamental goal of not hampering in any respect the solid anchoring of inflation expectations, both in the medium and long term. We are happy that this very solid anchoring has not been put into question. We will see what the results of the next survey are, but, at the moment, five-year ahead inflation expectations are at the level of 1.9% according to the Survey of Professional Forecasters. We attach great importance to being able to unwind everything that we are doing. I do not think that there is any doubt in the minds of observers, market participants, investors and households that we would be fully capable of doing that. I am not going to comment on other strategies and tactics, but as far as our own strategy and tactics are concerned, we are credible and will continue to solidly anchor our expectations, which we consider to be our major asset. It protects us from the longer-term risks of inflation occurring in the future and we are pleased to say that it has also functioned well in terms of protecting us from the shorter-term threats of deflation, which never materialised in our case. We continue to monitor the situation very closely. I said that in some markets in the euro area it is considered normal that a small proportion of assets are related to non-euro area assets. This would not be a reason for ineligibility. We are doing everything in order to support the euro area. I expect that all our colleagues, and the ECB, will look carefully at what they are purchasing. The ECB itself will purchase 8% of the €60 billion amount and the other 92% will be shared among all other members of the Eurosystem in this operation. We will see how to optimise this additional enhanced credit support that we are giving with a view to supporting the euro area. That goes without saying. "
04/06/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates are appropriate taking into account our decisions of early May, including the enhanced credit support measures, and all the information and analyses which have become available since then. We confirmed our expectation that price developments over the policy-relevant horizon will remain dampened by the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. Recent survey information indicates that, following two quarters of very negative growth, economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates. After a stabilisation phase, positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010. This assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure, as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in some more detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, and in particular a sharp fall in global demand and trade, economic activity weakened considerably in the first quarter of 2009. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, economic activity in the euro area contracted by 2.5% quarter on quarter, after a decline of 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This will have a significant negative impact on the average growth rate for 2009. However, more recently, there have been improvements in survey data, albeit at very low levels. In line with such evidence, after the extremely weak first quarter, activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates. After a stabilisation phase, positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010. This assessment is broadly in line with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real GDP growth will range between -5.1% and -4.1% in 2009 and between -1.0% and 0.4% in 2010. Compared with the March 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges have been revised downwards, in particular for 2009. A substantial negative carry-over effect from the previous year and the very weak result for the first quarter of 2009 significantly contributed to this downward revision. The projected gradual recovery next year, with rates of growth returning to positive levels by mid-2010, reflects the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as of the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area. Forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff projections, taking into account the results of the first quarter. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to the economic outlook are balanced. On the positive side, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. On the other hand, concerns remain relating to the following potential factors: a stronger impact on the real economy from the turmoil in financial markets, more unfavourable developments in labour markets, the intensification of protectionist pressures and, finally, adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, 0.0% in May, compared with 0.6% in April. As explained on earlier occasions, the further decline in inflation rates was fully anticipated and primarily reflects base effects resulting from the sharp swings in global commodity prices over the past 12 months. Looking ahead, owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to decline further and temporarily remain negative over the coming months, before returning to positive territory by the end of 2009. Such short-term movements are, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking further ahead, price and cost developments are expected to remain dampened in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. This outlook is consistent with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff projections for euro area inflation, in which annual HICP inflation is seen to range between 0.1% and 0.5% in 2009, revised slightly downwards from the March 2009 ECB staff projections. For 2010, Eurosystem staff project annual HICP inflation to range between 0.6% and 1.4%, broadly unchanged from the March 2009 ECB staff projections. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a similar picture. Against this background, it is again important to stress that the indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to these projections are broadly balanced. On the downside, these risks relate in particular to the outlook for economic activity, while on the upside they relate to higher than expected commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion and thus support the assessment of moderate inflationary pressures. In April, the annual growth rate of M3 declined further to 4.9% and that of loans to the private sector to 2.4%. However, especially with regard to M3 growth, the pace of decline in annual growth rates was slower than in previous months, reflecting a brisk growth in monetary aggregates in April. The latest developments in M3 components continue to reflect to a large extent the impact of past reductions in key ECB interest rates, which have led to declines both in the levels of different deposit interest rates and in the spreads between them. This has implied, for instance, lower opportunity costs for market participants to shift funds into highly liquid overnight deposits and explains the strengthening of annual M1 growth to 8.4% in April. At the same time, the reduced remuneration of other short-term deposits and marketable instruments continues to foster the allocation of funds to instruments outside M3. The outstanding amount of MFI loans to the private sector contracted somewhat further in April. This development is again mainly due to a negative flow of short-term lending to non-financial corporations, which partly reflects a lower need for working capital in view of the sharp deterioration in economic activity and business prospects during the first few months of the year, and greater recourse to liquidity buffers in financing such working capital. By contrast, longer-term lending to non-financial corporations remained positive. The past reductions in key ECB rates have continued to be passed on to lending rates to both non-financial corporations and households. The resulting improvement in financing conditions should provide ongoing support for economic activity in the period ahead. However, given the challenges which lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to further strengthen their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of the government measures to support the financial sector, in particular as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates are appropriate taking into account our decisions of early May, including the enhanced credit support measures, and all the information and analyses which have become available since then. We confirmed our expectation that price developments over the policy-relevant horizon will remain dampened by the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. Recent survey information indicates that, following two quarters of very negative growth, economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates. After a stabilisation phase, positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010. This assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure, as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will ensure that the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed. Hence, any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion. As has been emphasised many times, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, the latest projections by the European Commission point to a sharp increase in the euro area general government deficit and debt ratios in 2009. The deficit ratio is projected to rise to 5.3% of GDP in 2009 and further to 6.5% in 2010, from 1.9% in 2008, with the debt ratio exceeding 80% of GDP in 2010. A large majority of euro area countries are expected to exceed the 3% of GDP deficit reference value in 2009 and 2010. To ensure trust in the sustainability of public finances, an ambitious and credible adjustment effort will be required to return as soon as possible to sound fiscal positions, supported by a full application of the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. The rapid attainment of sound fiscal positions will be necessary to enable countries to deal with the additional fiscal burden owing to demographic ageing as well as the risks arising from government guarantees that were provided to stabilise financial sectors. Turning to structural policies, there is a strong case for undertaking further efforts to support potential growth in the euro area. It is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy. In this respect, the current situation can be seen as a catalyst to accelerate the implementation of necessary domestic reforms, notably labour market reforms to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions, as well as product market reforms to foster competition and speed up restructuring and productivity growth. At the same time, many of the policy measures taken in recent months with a view to supporting specific segments of the economy need to be phased out in a timely manner. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * And my last question would be: you repeated that you consider interest rates at the current level as appropriate, so can we take that as a sign that interest rates have reached a floor? And also, were there calls for further rate cuts this month? As regards your questions on interest rates, they are appropriate, as I just said on behalf of the Governing Council. And I also have nothing to add to or change in terms of what I said a month ago– and I quote this word for word – that “we did not decide today that the new level of our policy rates was the lowest level that can never be crossed, whatever future circumstances may be”. As regards the present level, I repeat: we consider the present level of interest rates to be appropriate, taking into account all available information and analysis. As regards your questions on the programme for the purchase of covered bonds, we decided on €60 billion and no other decision has been taken at this stage. We will carry out the programme, which is explained in the press release that you have been given. I will not comment on the discussions that took place. As always, there were discussions. What counts is what was decided unanimously by the Governing Council. What counts is today’s decision which we consider was – and is – the appropriate decision, taking into account all circumstances. And, we don’t expect in any respect that it will hamper our attachment to the delivery of price stability in line with our definition. We consider all this to be fully in line with our monetary policy strategy. I have repeated several times that we are inflexibly attached to the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability, which is the main asset that we have in the present circumstances. I was privileged to talk to Kanzlerin Merkel yesterday by telephone. I can tell you that she confirmed to me that she fully respects the independence of the ECB. And I told her that we were very strongly determined to both, taking the appropriate decision in the current exceptional circumstances and being absolutely crystal clear on the exit strategy. This is something we consider to be necessary because it is what our primary mandate given by the Treaty calls for; but also because it will contribute to confidence today. An appropriate exit strategy will contribute to improving confidence today. I also confirmed to Kanzlerin Merkel that we have a proved track record in terms of the fierce independence of the ECB. We did not decrease rates when in 2004 a German Chancellor asked us to decrease rates. We did not decrease rates when other Heads of State and Government asked us to change our policy. We increased rates in December 2005, when 10 governments out of 12 were calling on us not to increase rates, and I could quote a number of similar circumstances. Everything we do is done without bowing to any influence or pressure. We decide on the basis of our own judgement, and I was extremely happy that Kanzlerin Merkel could confirm that she fully backed our independence and appreciated what we were doing. I don’t think that she said that. Perhaps you read that, but it is not what she said. She said that she fully supports our independence and she did not consider that our independence had been “polluted” in any respect. In any case, you know what we are doing; you know that we are fiercely independent; and you know that we can prove that. I do not want to elaborate any further on that. But I could give many other examples. At this stage, I would stick to what we have decided today. I can only tell you that, as regards the duration of those bonds – and I won’t pre-commit, because we will have to optimise these operations, taking into account the market situation and the various constraints that we might have – we might perhaps concentrate on the medium to longer term, say, three to ten years. But again, this is not a pre-commitment, and we will see how exactly we optimise the purchases. When we say that we will end the programme at the end of June next year, it doesn’t necessarily mean that we will “tranche” the purchases equally month by month. We have room for manoeuvre in order to optimise our operations on the basis of the decisions already taken. Secondly, I am curious to know if you could give us a sense of your measures of success for this programme. How will you know if it is working, and whether an expanded programme in terms of assets or money will be needed? And then finally, could you talk a little bit more about inflation expectations? Market expectations are, as you say, anchored, but consumer expectations are at a record low. Does that concern you? Maybe you could help us to understand a little bit of the disconnection between your contention that price stability will be anchored in the medium term and your projections, which, as far as I can see, don’t support that? On your last point, we, as you know, follow with great attention the medium to longer-term inflation expectations, which in our last reading of the Survey of Professional Forecasters were at the level of 1.9%. And when we look at the information we can extract from financial markets, namely the five-years forward five-years break-even inflation rate, which we consider one of the most pertinent indicators of information that we can extract from financial markets, we are at a level of 2.5% which is in line with our definition of price stability taking into account the risk premia that are embedded. Again, we consider at the moment that we have solid, firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the medium to long term. And that is extremely important. It is probably our main asset, because it served us extremely well in the period where we had very significant inflationary pressures. Until now we have seen it withstand in the new low inflation environment in which we find ourselves. That being said, we remain constantly alert and we will continue to look very carefully at these various indicators. As regards our own €60 billion operations, we expect automatic sterilisation. If anything were necessary in order to be fully in line with our monetary policy strategy, we would do it. I don’t call what we have decided “quantitative easing”. I would qualify it as further “enhanced credit support”. We are not at all embarking on “quantitative easing” with these decisions. And the second question, with the fast-moving developments in the Baltic countries at the moment, I wonder whether you could offer these countries any assurance that the ECB stands ready to help? On your first question I have nothing to add to what I have already said. Kanzlerin Merkel supports the ECB totally and fully respects its independence, as I have already had the opportunity to explain. We are in full agreement that exit strategies are of the utmost importance and that what we do today should not in any respect hamper the medium to long-term delivery of price stability, which is a crucial element for all our fellow citizens. Those who think that there is a contradiction between the decisions we take, on a short-term basis, to face up to the enormous challenges that exist today and that have existed for a certain period of time are mistaken. Indeed, we were, if I may immodestly say so, the first to diagnose that we had a real problem, and the first to take very important decisions, as early as 9 August 2007. That being said, it is extremely important for the success of what we are doing today, that the confidence of economic agents, businesses and fellow citizens, is reinforced by the judgement that the steering of medium and long-term policies is reasonable, wise and in line with the overall interest of all such agents. This is true for monetary policies as well as for fiscal policies. And that is true in all countries. All the information I have from all the euro area countries and fellow citizens points in the same direction, without a doubt. With regard to your second question, on the Baltic countries, we are closely following the situation in all countries, not particularly only that in the Baltic countries. We are observing the most recent events with confidence that the appropriate solutions will be found. And I am confident that the solidity of the Baltic States will continue to be demonstrated. And secondly, talking about exit strategies, have you decided how you handle the bond purchases within the Eurosystem and how any losses might be divided? It was a phone call, and I would not comment further. There was a very good meeting of minds. As regards your second question the monetary policy operation involving this unconventional measure of the purchase of covered bonds, what we have decided is to earmark these covered bonds and, taking into account the current exceptional situation, we will have a notional amount of revenue which will be considered to be shared, but it would be an ex ante notional amount of revenue to simplify our own operations inside the Eurosystem. I have already said we will look at it very carefully, and if it is not the case, then we will take appropriate measures. No, I am not softer. I have exactly the same language for all Heads of State and Government. And again I could quote a very large number of cases where I reiterated our fierce independence. I told Kanzlerin Merkel that we were fiercely independent and Kanzlerin Merkel told me precisely that she was defending our independence, fully respecting our independence, and very satisfied with our decisions. There is no unequal treatment. On the interest rates, I stick to what I have said and there is nothing else to add. I remain very cautious. That being said, all observers and, to my knowledge, all international institutions that have published their own projections are in line with our own staff projections, namely, that the pick-up of growth into positive territory is to be expected in the course of 2010. So I have to say there is nothing new there. It is fully in line with the overall observation of those who are making projections. I would only add that the future growth depends on us. We are not passive in looking at what is going on. The future course of the economy depends on the rapidity of the implementation of decisions already taken. And I have to say, in this respect, you might see that in the introductory statement of the Governing Council, there is this recommendation for the financial sector in particular to accelerate the strengthening of the capital bases of the banks and also to utilise more fully the decisions that have already been taken as regards recapitalisation in particular. The figure I have in mind – but the Vice President knows that better than anybody – is that out of the 100% of decisions that were taken, we are at the level of 56% of recapitalisation. This is something which has been decided and we think that it is extremely important to implement that rapidly. I have to say the same for the fiscal activation that we have mentioned. We said that it was absolutely necessary to also have an exit strategy. At the present moment, decisions have been taken and the rapidity of the implementation of these decisions is also extremely important. And it is not only important from a mechanistic standpoint. It is important because it would improve confidence and confidence is the most important ingredient in the present situation. Everything that we do to improve confidence will help confirming that 2010 will be the year of the recovery. And everything that we do ourselves is inspired by the necessity to improve confidence and, in particular, not to hamper in any respect the long-term delivery of price stability which is our primary goal. The Swedish central bank – the Swedish authorities – have been very helpful in the past, and that is important. In the previous situation we all had to cope with, there were joint efforts involving the European Union, the IMF, the EBRD and us, and also on a bilateral basis by Sweden. I think it was extremely helpful. So I’m sure if needed, we will continue to have these joint efforts. I never comment on that, but I have full confidence that the Government of Latvia will take the decisions that are appropriate for the domestic context without a change in the currency. A percentage of what? No, we will see exactly what is most appropriate. But we will do both, that is absolutely clear. As you know we are in a decentralised system as regards banking surveillance and, indeed, all kinds of surveillance. It is up to the national authority to proceed with the appropriate testing and checking of the situation of its respective financial institutions – its respective banks. And I know that this is done very seriously and professionally. As regards the system itself, we are undertaking at the European level through the Committee of European Banking Supervisors a systemic checking that will culminate in September. We are ourselves involved in judging the appropriate macro environment indicators. This is the combination of a systemic approach at the level of the single market as a whole and of national responsibilities that have to be discharged and are discharged in a very professional and strict fashion. And similarly about the 5% trade rated rise in the euro since December? On your second point, I will only say, with some solemnity, that it is very important and we appreciate enormously the fact that the US authorities are repeating that a strong US dollar is in the interests of the United States. This has been repeated by the Secretary of the Treasury and by Ben Bernanke recently. It is extremely important and we regard it as an extremely important message. As regards your first question, we are looking at it very carefully because it is a very complex set of influences, but it is clear that the revival of the money market – which was one of our major goals and we were very clear and candid in explaining to you that a number of our decisions were taken with that in mind – has led to a certain increase in the EONIA rate. We assume that there is currently a “learning by doing” process among market participants. We saw the EONIA decline again in the most recent period, and there might be a number of other reasons for this, given that we are at the end of the maintenance period. So we will continue to look at it but we are very mindful of the need for our money market to function as well as possible. In any case, the spreads are now clearly at pre-Lehman levels, and this is not only true in our case, it is also the case across the Atlantic and across the Channel. That is really a matter which has to be decided upon at the level of the various national surveillance authorities and at the level of the various nations. Some have already disclosed a number of information; others have said that they were fully satisfied with the position of their banks, and so forth. We must respect the present decentralised framework. All I can say is that we encourage the national supervisory authorities of course to do their job in the most active, professional and serious fashion. This is very important. Question Given your staff projections and you just mentioned you want to be very careful when you talk about 2010, do you actually think that the average GDP growth will be negative next year still? And in terms of deflation, do you think that the risks have actually increased now that the HICP has slowed now more than expected in May? On 2010, I just mentioned the ranges. Uncertainty is of course involved there. 2010 is a year, at least in the view of the majority of forecasters, including our own staff – the staff of the Eurosystem, not only the staff of the ECB – when the first half of the year will probably be at a level of zero and the second half positive, and the year will have a profile which would pick up. But you also have the negative carry-over coming from the year 2009. So, when you compute the arithmetic average, you can be a little bit below zero or at zero. And again, I reiterate the fact that the final result depends on us. Nobody is the sole master of the future: the future of the economy is made by all of us. The future is made by our fellow citizens, to a very large extent. If they have confidence, then they consume more and we are in a different, more positive economic universe. And this, in turn, would trigger investment by the corporate sector and starting acceleration of investment. So, we are not passively expecting future economic developments. They depend on our capacity to increase confidence. On your second question: no, we do not see a change in those risks. There are indications that are going in one direction but also indications that are going in another direction. There is some downward revision of inflation in a short-term perspective. But at the same time, the market more or less believes that there are also risks in the other direction. I am speaking at a global level, not so much at our own level. But at this stage I would say, we remain very alert, but we do not see a change in the risks to price stability. I was referring to the domestic measures that the government has to take in order to continue the adjustment in the best fashion possible, and I do not have any other comments on that. No, I was referring to the bilateral relationship we had in the form of a repo agreement with the national central bank of Latvia. We had a repo agreement, and I was only referring to that. "
07/05/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by a further 25 basis points and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 50 basis points, to 1.00% and 1.75% respectively. The interest rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.25%. This decision brings the total reduction in the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem since 8 October 2008 to 325 basis points. Current key ECB interest rates are appropriate taking into account all available information and analysis. In addition to the reductions in interest rates, the Governing Council decided today to proceed with its enhanced credit support approach. In continuity and consistency with the operations we have undertaken since October 2008, and in recognition of the central role played by the banking system in financing the euro area economy, we will conduct liquidity-providing longer-term refinancing operations with a maturity of 12 months. The operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rate for the first of these operations, to be announced on 23 June 2009, will be the rate on the main refinancing operations at that time. Subsequently, the fixed rate may include a premium to the rate on the main refinancing operations, depending on the circumstances at the time. The Governing Council has decided in principle that the Eurosystem will purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area. The detailed modalities will be announced after the Governing Council meeting of 4 June 2009. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided that the European Investment Bank will become an eligible counterparty in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations with effect from 8 July 2009 and under the same conditions as any other counterparty. These decisions have been taken to promote the ongoing decline in money market term rates, to encourage banks to maintain and expand their lending to clients, to help to improve market liquidity in important segments of the private debt security market, and to ease funding conditions for banks and enterprises. Today’s decisions take into account the expectation that price developments will continue to be dampened by the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. The latest economic data and survey information suggest tentative signs of a stabilisation at very low levels, after a first quarter which was significantly weaker than expected. The world economy, including the euro area, is still undergoing a severe downturn, with the prospect of both external and domestic demand remaining very weak over 2009 before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. This assessment incorporates a number of adverse developments which are likely to materialise over the coming months, such as a further deterioration in labour markets. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing, as money and credit growth have further decelerated in recent months. Against the background of these developments, after today’s decisions we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in some more detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, economic activity continued to weaken in the euro area in the course of the first quarter of 2009, in parallel with the ongoing downturn in the world economy. This weakening in the first quarter appears to have been significantly more pronounced than projected in March. More recently, there have been some tentative signs in survey data of a stabilisation, albeit at very low levels. Overall, economic activity is likely to be very weak for the remainder of this year, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. In particular, the substantial fall in commodity prices since the summer of 2008 is supporting real disposable income and thus consumption. In addition, external as well as domestic demand should increasingly benefit from the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as from the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area. Taking all these measures and their effects into account, as well as the pronouncedly negative growth in the first quarter of this year and the most recently published forecasts by public institutions, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. On the downside, there are concerns that the turmoil in financial markets could have a stronger impact on the real economy, as well as that protectionist pressures could intensify and that there could be adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. At the same time, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects due to the decrease in commodity prices and to the policy measures taken. Annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, 0.6% in April, unchanged from March. As explained on earlier occasions, the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp fall in global commodity prices over this period. Moreover, signs of a more broad-based reduction in inflationary pressure are increasingly emerging. Looking ahead, base effects stemming from past energy price movements will play a significant role in the shorter-term dynamics of the HICP. Accordingly, we expect to see headline annual inflation rates declining further and temporarily remaining at negative levels for some months around mid-year. Thereafter, annual inflation rates are expected to increase again. Such short-term dynamics are, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking further ahead, HICP inflation is likely to remain positive and below 2% in 2010, with price developments being dampened by ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The risks surrounding this outlook are broadly balanced. They relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion. This is signalled, for instance, by the concurrent further declines in the annual growth rates of M3 to 5.1% and of loans to the private sector to 3.2%. The deceleration supports the assessment of diminishing inflationary pressures in the medium term. Month-on-month developments in M3 and its components have remained volatile, with data for March showing a contraction in most of the respective outstanding amounts. This may partly reflect market participants’ investment responses to the past reduction in the key ECB interest rates, which has reduced the remuneration of short-term deposits and marketable instruments and fostered corresponding shifts in the allocation of funds not only within M3 but also to instruments outside M3. The outstanding amount of MFI loans to the private sector contracted further in March, reflecting mainly a negative flow of lending to non-financial corporations. The reduced amount of financing is again related mainly to loans with shorter maturities, while the net flow of loans with longer maturities remained positive. The decline in short-term lending is likely to reflect to a large extent lower demand in the wake of a sharp deterioration in economic activity and business prospects at the start of the year. Interest rates on short-term and floating rate bank loans to households and non-financial corporations have declined significantly over recent months, indicating that the transmission of monetary policy impulses to the economy continues. Overall, the latest money and credit data support the assessment that both banks and money-holding sectors are reducing their highly leveraged positions built up in past years. To sum up, the Governing Council’s decisions today take into account the expectation that price developments will continue to be dampened by the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. The latest economic data and survey information suggest tentative signs of a stabilisation at very low levels, after a first quarter which was significantly weaker than expected. The world economy, including the euro area, is still undergoing a severe downturn, with the prospect of both external and domestic demand remaining very weak over 2009 before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. This assessment incorporates a number of adverse developments which are likely to materialise over the coming months, such as a further deterioration in labour markets. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing, as money and credit growth have further decelerated in recent months. Against the background of these developments, after today’s decisions we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. All in all, since the intensification of the financial crisis in September 2008, the Eurosystem has taken a series of measures that are unprecedented in nature, scope and timing. As a consequence, we have observed a clear decline in key money market interest rates that euro area banks typically use as benchmarks to reset floating rate loans and price new short-term loans. This in turn has led to sharp declines in rates for such loans to households and non-financial corporations. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy has provided ongoing support for households and corporations. The Governing Council will ensure that, once the macroeconomic environment improves, the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed so that any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion. Indeed, as has been stressed many times, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, the latest projections for euro area countries point to continued revisions to budget balance estimates and forecasts. Higher budget deficits and the fiscal impact of financial sector support measures will lead to significantly higher government debt-to-GDP ratios. In addition, updated projections by the Economic Policy Committee of the EU show that most countries face a challenging task in dealing with the budgetary costs of an ageing population. Therefore, it is paramount that countries make a strong and credible commitment to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions, respecting fully the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. This will preserve the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances and will support both the recovery and long-term economic growth. The credibility of fiscal consolidation commitments will be strengthened if they are part of national policy frameworks oriented to the medium term. Turning to structural policies, it is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy. This calls for an accelerated implementation of labour market reforms to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions as well as product market reforms to foster competition and speed up restructuring. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * It is at the main refinancing rate at the time. And the second question is, what did you mean when you said that you, in principle, agreed on buying bonds. Did you mean that the Governing Council will actually vote on it again at the next Governing Council meeting? Or is it a done deal, with only the technicalities to be discussed next time? And finally, if I am not mistaken, the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) is now available, and I was wondering whether the results surprise on the downside in any way, and if so, enough to cause you any concern? To your first question, it should be noted that we did not decide today that the new level of our policy rates was the lowest level that can never be crossed, whatever future circumstances may be. At the same time, with regard to the present situation, the Governing Council considers the present level of interest rates to be appropriate, taking into account all available information and analyses. In particular the fact that the first quarter was much less flattering than projected by all observers and institutions, and that we already know that the new staff projections, which will be published in June, will be revised down significantly compared with our previous staff projections three months ago and will very likely be in line with the most recent projections published for 2009 growth, in particular by the Commission and the IMF. To your second question, we have agreed in principle. This is therefore a clear agreement and we will present the details and technicalities of this purchase of covered bonds at our next meeting. I would say, at this stage, that we expect to engage in a programme that could be around €60 billion. There will be a decision on the technicalities. As regards your third questions the SPF, it was very much in line with most of the analyses currently being produced. We are heartened by the fact that the medium-term expectations remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with our definition of price stability. Let me also take advantage of your question to mention once again, that, according to the SPF, these medium-term inflation expectations have oscillated between 1.7% and 2% since the setting-up of the euro. This is a very small range for this anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations, and at the moment, they stand at 1.9%, which is something that illustrates our very solid anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations, in line with our definition of price stability in the medium term. I stick to what I have already said. We consider the present level to be appropriate, taking into account all available information and analyses. As regards the issue of future rates, we did not decide that the new level of our policy rates was the lowest level that can never be crossed, whatever future circumstances may be. Another thing I would like to know is, are other asset classes an option for the ECB and what were the positions in the Council when discussing these non-standard measures? First of all, let me say that all the decisions mentioned today – one decision on interest rates, two fully fledged decisions and one in principle on the non-standard measures – were taken unanimously, after very profound analysis and duly weighing, as always, the pros and cons to be sure that we were taking the right and appropriate decision. As regards the purchase of assets we have decided to engage in the purchase of covered bonds. I gave you already the order of magnitude of what we could do in this domain. The second question comes back to the covered bond issue. I wondered if you could explain your general rationale behind this specific asset class? And in that vein, if I can recall correctly, covered bonds are mainly used by the banks in which a lot of German is spoken for refinancing, and not so much in the rest of the euro zone. So are you not implicitly delivering an advantage here to banks that use this particular asset to refinance? On your first point, I have no expectations for the next meeting. We will have our next meeting and we will examine the situation. We will decide on the technicalities for the purchase of these covered bonds. We have a clear rendezvous for that in June. I stick to the two messages I have given today. We have not decided that the new level of our policy rates was the lowest level that we could never cross whatever the future circumstances could be. And at the same time we have incorporated in today’s decision all available pieces of information and analyses, including the fact that we know in advance that we will have a level of projections, concerning growth in particular, that will be substantially lower than the previous staff projections and in line probably with what we see as the overall analysis based on the already known facts and figures. On the covered bonds, I remind you that we are in the euro area of 329 million people, this is a single market with a single currency, and what we are doing is what we judge appropriate for the single market with a single currency. All of us in the Governing Council are striving to take the right decisions expected by the 329 million fellow citizens. Covered bonds were considered by the Governing Council as a segment of the private securities markets that in general has been particularly affected, more so than others, in terms of the impact of the financial turbulences. And secondly how are you going to pay for this? Will the purchase be sterilised or can we write that you are going to be printing money? And then on the main interest rate: I wonder if you would be prepared to give an assurance today to the 329 million citizens of the euro zone that interest rates, your main interest rate, will remain at the current level or lower for any length of time? On your first question, I give you a rendezvous for the next meeting when we will discuss all the technicalities for this operation, which is new for us and which calls for appropriate handling. Around €60 billion is only an order of magnitude, appropriate for attaining our goal, to help to revive this particular segment of the market. With regard to sterilisation, it is included in the question of the exit strategy. I mentioned in the introductory remarks that we consider this issue as absolutely decisive. We have to be up to the present exceptional circumstances. And I don’t want to repeat all the areas where we were the first central bank to act and to take bold decisions. Whether it was the longer-term refinancing of commercial banks, or at the beginning of the turmoil being the most forthcoming central bank as regards its collateral framework, or when we had to take bold action in particular at the very beginning of the turbulence on 9 August 2007. As regards today’s decision taking into account all elements we considered that we could and we should go beyond what had been until now our main channel for enhanced credit support mainly by the refinancing of commercial banks which has, by the way, produced important results. I would like to mention en passant the figures which show that thanks to the decisions we have taken so far - they don’t incorporate of course the new decision taken today - our one-year money market has lower interest rates than in the sister central banks’ money markets. This is also the case at least with one sister central bank for the six- and the three-month money market interest rates. One has to take into account everything, and in particular our handling of our own money market with our full allotment, fixed interest rates procedure, the very forthcoming attitude we have as regards longer-term refinancing, which has even been enlarged today and the collateral that we accept. That being said the Governing Council considers sterilisation and the exit strategy absolutely essential to maintain the maximum amount of credibility in the medium and long term. The public debate emerging on whether or not some central banks are paving the way at the global level for future inflation is extraordinarily counterproductive. We, central banks – and I’m sure that we are all in agreement on this – are determined to solidly anchor longer-term expectations and eliminate these fears about future inflation. As regards the main interest rate, I have nothing to add to the two messages I gave you a moment ago. And one question to the Vice-President, Mr Papademos: in your view, what are the reasons for the banks not taking the assistance from the governments so far? Do you think these measures are effective then? As regards your first question, you could put the same question to all central banks in the world, couldn’t you? In any case central banks cannot manipulate the three-month, six-month and one-year market interest rates with administrative decisions. We are coping with the means we have to handle the money market, with the credibility of this handling and with the liquidity and credit risks incorporated in the money market interest rates. And I already mentioned the comparison with other central banks - in the view of the Governing Council, the present level of our policy rates today is appropriate. Papademos: As regards your question on the assistance banks received from governments. The government support that has been provided to European banks has been substantial, both in the form of recapitalisations and in the form of government guarantees. If I recall correctly, in the euro area the total amount of capital injections from governments so far is about €110 billion and the total amount of guarantees on new bank debt that has been provided is about €300 billion. However, at the same time the actual support provided to banks is considerably below the amount of committed support. There are several reasons for this and they differ in terms of their importance across countries. On the whole, the take-up rate is relatively low for government guarantees. The take-up rate, according to the latest available data, is less than 20%. However, in most countries, including countries where the take-up rate is on the low side, it is considered to be adequate overall in the light of the needs of banks – not in all countries but in most countries. For example, banks’ needs for government guarantees depend on the time profile of the maturity of their debt and they also reflect the relatively subdued demand for bank loans of the private sector. In the light of these conditions, the demand for guarantees in some countries has been relatively low. With regard to guarantees on short-term bank debt, one explanation is the amount of financing provided by the Eurosystem, which has reduced the demand for these guarantees on the part of the banks. I would add, however, that in some cases perhaps other factors are discouraging the use of government guarantees by banks, and this may have to do either with the pricing of the guarantees on long-term debt or with some specific factors that are discouraging their use. As regards your question on the measures’ effectiveness, I have two remarks. First, overall, these measures have been effective in stabilising the banking system by strengthening banks balance sheets, as well as by improving conditions in the wholesale bank funding market. They have also bolstered confidence in the financial system. Second, with regard to their effectiveness in fostering the provision of an adequate flow of credit to the economy, there is not enough evidence to make a definite assessment. As you know, the provisions of guarantees, in particular, and the other measures have been implemented gradually over the last few months. So we do not have sufficient evidence to answer this question. An additional reason is that it is difficult, given the limited evidence, to disentangle the positive effects of the government measures on credit provision from the negative effects of other factors that are affecting the provision of credit, such as the de-leveraging process of banks or the weakening of the economy. Secondly, I also want to clarify, you have said that your policy rates are now not at their lowest level or do not have to be…. I said we did not decide today that they were at the lowest possible level. I did not say at all that they were not at the lowest rate. I said we did not decide. That is very important. As regards your first question on the covered bonds, I have been clear, we have taken the decision in principle to purchase covered bonds. We have not taken any other decision on any other purchase whether in principle or not. So take my response as simple and clear as that. As regards your question on the deposit rate, the deposit rate is part of the overall rates, and I make no distinction from that standpoint between the various rates. As regards your question on the medium to long-term inflation expectations, it is clear that we are experiencing a phenomenon of low inflation and foresee negative inflation for a number of months around mid-year. We consider that this does not correspond to a generalised and sustained negative evolution of prices. It is very much concentrated on the base effect coming from the price of oil, energy and some other commodities. It is not generalised and it is temporary, because all the projections that we have indicate that it will go back in the positive territory at the end of the year and will remain there in the next period to come. So I would draw your attention to the fact that from that standpoint, and taking into account that inflation expectations at present are solidly anchored – and I have to say very well-anchored in comparison with other economies – we are in a situation where purchasing power is given to the economic agents, to households, which is good. It is purchasing power for the economic agents, for households in particular, that is now given back after the previous increase in prices. So it has both disinflationary and expansionary effect, as is natural in such cases. That being said, we will remain permanently alert, we will follow very carefully the evolution of expectations. This capacity to continue solidly anchoring inflation expectations, which is really one of the major successes of the ECB, will continue to be fundamental in our eyes. We believe that it is fundamental not only because it makes it possible to avoid either inflation or deflation, but also because it solidly anchors the confidence of our fellow citizens and of economic agents. And confidence is absolutely of the essence at the moment in Europe as well as everywhere in the world. No, the idea is to revive the market, which has been very heavily affected, and all that goes with this revival, including the spreads, the depth and the liquidity of the market. We are not at all embarking on quantitative easing. This is done at the level of the various decentralised surveillance authorities, and of course we are following this and are very alert in this domain. Let me only say that we rely upon the extreme vigilance of all national surveillance authorities, and we have always encouraged them to be in as close cooperation and collaboration as possible. And, second question: some recent economic data have been better than expected, especially the sentiment. Do you see green shoots in the eurozone economy at the moment? On your first question, everybody knows to what extent we are attached to the exit strategy. Everybody knows to what extent we are prudent making a balance between the short term and the longer term considerations. Our credibility is totally intact. We are not in the position that we would have to defend ourselves against the fact that we could not get out of the non-conventional measures taken. That being said, we have a rendezvous as regards the new purchase of assets for the month of June. On your second question, today in Germany we had an encouraging indication. For the first time after a long period positive hard data followed a number of encouraging soft data in particular PMI and confidence surveys. In both cases we could see what I would call the ‘second derivative’ changing its sign. The sign of the second derivative has changed. It was negative. We were in a free fall, and now we see that there is some kind of a stabilisation. But as I said, we have to be realistic: it is stabilisation at a low level and we continue to be in negative territory. But of course the fact that the second derivative has changed its sign is important. However, we have to be fully aware of the present situation. Behind us we have a very bad first quarter which was much weaker than expected by most observers and institutions. It is behind us, but it has a bearing on the average for this year. Clearly, the second quarter will be less negative, though still negative, and we will see what I called the second derivative operating – fortunately, I have to say. So, the situation is complex and you have to take it with its complexity. But it depends on us, on our capacity to improve the level of confidence of all economic agents that these ‘green shoots’ will be greener and greener, and that will permit what we all want: the recovery to operate as well as possible and without hampering in any respect the long-term future of stability and the long-term confidence of economic agents. It is this balance that we are permanently trying to find. What we have done today gives you an idea of what we believe the appropriate balance should be in the present circumstances with all their complexity. All the decisions were taken after a very detailed and deep discussion of the pros and cons, the assets and liabilities associated with each of our decisions, but the decisions were taken unanimously. We have been concentrating on non-conventional measures of extreme boldness - fully successful, in our opinion - through the channel of bank refinancing that accounts for more than 70% of the financing of the euro area. After all we have done and improved thus far we also took an important additional decision today. At this stage we concluded that it was appropriate to help a channel of financing in the economy that we saw was obviously in a difficult situation. We thought that it would appropriately complement our main channel of financing for the economy, the channel on which we had previously concentrated our efforts and where we have also taken today an important additional decision. If I might use our own vocabulary, it is part of our “enhanced credit support” operations. We have used this expression for quite a long period of time because we consider all the non-conventional measures we have taken in connection with the refinancing of banks as enhanced credit support. If you wish, you could call that credit easing, because it is a way of improving the functioning of the market that had been affected particularly markedly by the financial turbulences. "
02/04/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 25 basis points. This decision brings the total reduction in the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem since 8 October 2008 to 300 basis points. Today’s decision takes into account the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued, reflecting the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. The latest economic data and survey information confirm that the world economy, including the euro area, is undergoing a severe downturn. Both global and euro area demand are likely to remain very weak over 2009, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. After today’s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, economic activity has weakened markedly in the euro area, as domestic demand has contracted in parallel with the downturn in the world economy. Available data and survey indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area has remained very weak in early 2009. It is likely to remain very subdued for the remainder of the year but is expected to gradually recover in 2010. The substantial fall in commodity prices since the summer of 2008 is supporting real disposable income and thus consumption. In addition, external as well as domestic demand should increasingly benefit from the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as from measures taken to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area. Taking these effects into account, we see the risks to this outlook for economic activity as being broadly balanced. On the one hand, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects due to the decrease in commodity prices and to policy measures taken. On the other hand, there are concerns that the turmoil in financial markets could have a stronger impact on the real economy, as well as that protectionist pressures could intensify and that there could be adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. Annual HICP inflation has fallen further, from 1.2% in February to 0.6% in March, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate As explained on earlier occasions, the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp fall in global commodity prices over this period. Moreover, signs of a more broad-based reduction in inflationary pressure are increasingly emerging. Looking ahead, base effects stemming from past energy price effects will play a significant role in the shorter-term dynamics of the HICP. Accordingly, we expect to see headline annual inflation rates declining further in the coming months and temporarily reaching negative levels around mid-year. Thereafter, annual inflation rates should increase again. Such short-term movements are, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking further ahead, over the policy-relevant horizon, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain below 2% in 2010, reflecting mainly ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The risks surrounding this outlook are broadly balanced. They relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the high month-to-month volatility of developments in M3 and its components observed since the intensification of the financial turmoil in September 2008. Looking through this volatility, the pace of monetary expansion in the euro area has continued to decelerate markedly and supports the assessment of diminishing risks to price stability in the medium term. Developments within M3 clearly reflect market participants’ specific investment responses to the intensification of the financial turmoil, but increasingly also the impact of the past reduction in the key ECB interest rates. As this reduction has narrowed the gaps between the interest rates paid on the different categories of short-term deposits, it has fostered shifts in the allocation of funds. For example, the demand for overnight deposits further strengthened in February and contributed to the rise in the annual growth rate of M1 to 6.3%, while the demand for short-term time deposits weakened considerably. The flow of MFI loans to non-financial corporations and households has remained very subdued. The slightly negative flow of lending to non-financial corporations in February reflects a decline in the outstanding amount of loans with a shorter maturity, while the net flow in loans with longer maturities remained positive. The decline in short-term lending may be indicative of a reduction in loan demand related to the weakening of economic activity. However, supply effects have probably also affected loan developments. In this respect, developments over the past few months may in part reflect ongoing efforts of banks as well as the corporate and household sector to reduce the highly leveraged positions built up in past years. To sum up, today’s decision takes into account the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued, reflecting the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. The latest economic data and survey information confirm that the world economy, including the euro area, is undergoing a severe downturn. Both global and euro area demand are likely to remain very weak over 2009, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. After today’s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, it is necessary that countries’ commitments to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions are credible, respecting fully the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is essential to maintain the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances, which is important both for the economy to recover and for supporting long-term growth. Countries subject to the excessive deficit procedure need to comply strictly with the ECOFIN Council recommendations for correcting their deficits. Many countries will need to specify further credible consolidation measures for 2010 and beyond. Full and consistent implementation of the EU’s legal provisions for sound fiscal policies is a prerequisite for the maintenance of their credibility as one of the pillars of the institutional framework of Economic and Monetary Union. Turning to structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomes the commitment of the spring European Council to make full use of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs in the current situation. The updated recommendations for the euro area countries call for an accelerated implementation of reforms to support the economy, facilitate necessary adjustments and ensure a high level of growth potential. It remains essential that government support measures do not distort competition or delay necessary structural adjustment processes and that governments remain firmly committed to avoiding protectionism. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * Second, do you regard the actual interest rate level as the lower limit mark, or do you still consider that there is room for manoeuvre, if needed? Third, did you discuss, or were the extension of the refi operations’ maturities or purchases of corporate debt on your agenda today? In response to your first question, as always, we had a very in-depth discussion, we looked at the situation from every possible angle and we took our decision by consensus. We took the decision to lower all three interest rates by 25 basis points. This means that the deposit interest rate is at 0.25%, the main policy rate is at 1.25% and the Lombard rate is at 2.25%. These are the lowest interest rates ever observed since the creation of the euro and, to my knowledge, as far as the predecessor institutions of the ECB are concerned, the lowest since the Second World War. So these are extremely low levels by historical standards. Again, we looked at the situation from every possible angle and we decided by consensus. To answer your second question: Is it the lower limit? With regard to the main policy rate, I would say very candidly that it is not the lowest limit. I do not exclude that we could – in a very measured way – go down from the present level. As regards the deposit rate, I think it would be fair to say that, at 0.25%, it is at an extremely low level, and I do not expect that we will make any change to this level in the period to come. The advantage of having decreased both the level of the main refinancing operation and that of the deposit facility is that we still have the full corridor going down, without having to re-narrow immediately the present corridor for our very short-term rates, so that we can expect the very short term money market rates, particularly the overnight rate, to reflect fully this reduction. I have to remind you, because it is not as well-known as it should be, that at the time of speaking, after the last decrease of 50 basis points of our interest rates and, of course, before today’s decrease of 25 basis points, our six-month and twelve-month money market rates were lower than the US dollar money market rates. This is something which needs to be known and is probably due to a combination of lower risk premia and lower liquidity premia on our own money market rates. We will continue to look at the evolution of our money market rates with great attention. It is worth remembering that, a few months ago, I told you that we would make every effort to revive our money market and to allow it function as well as possible. Regarding the third question, the Governing Council intends to decide on further non-standard measures at our next monetary policy meeting. As you know, we have already taken what we deem to be highly non-standard measures as regards the refinancing operations to commercial banks: In particular the unlimited supply of liquidity at fixed rates and the very substantial expansion of the eligibility of collateral. We have, therefore, already taken decisions that are extraordinarily non-standard and which have, contributed to the above-mentioned better functioning of our money market and have also contributed decisively to the increase in the size of our own balance sheet. By the way, it is worth noting that, at the time of speaking, the size of our balance sheet is larger as a proportion of GDP than that of the Federal Reserve System, although, of course, the Federal Reserve has already decided to – and will continue to – expand the size of their balance sheet. I am mentioning this because it is not necessarily very well-known. Hence, we have already taken a number of decisions that are non-standard and we intend to take further non-standard decisions at our next meeting. I know that I will be asked a hundred questions of the kind “what will you decide: will it be this, or this, or that?”, so I will see you here in one month’s time at the next monetary policy meeting, and then I will stand ready to announce the decisions of the Governing Council in this regard. Now it is clear: I remember that, at the last meeting, I said “if and when we decide I will tell you”, and now I can tell you “when” that will be. We will see, and I should add that there is still an “if” in that we will see what we decide. I will give you all the details next time. But today, we took the decision once again to decide next time on this very important issue and, of course, as I have already explained, to decide on the interest rates. On the question of the evolution of credit, I said what I had to say on behalf of the Governing Council. It is very clear. Obviously, we have facts and figures before us, and we have to understand better how to attribute what we are observing to the demand side and what we could attribute to the supply side. As regard supply, we are doing whatever we can to keep our banking system as active as possible. I would echo all that has been said in the run-up to the important meeting, the G20 which is taking place in London, namely that a great number of decisions have been taken by the authorities with respect to support in the financial sphere and that it is extremely important for all those measures to be implemented as soon as possible, measures that are very important for enabling the banking system to lend, which is the task of the banking system. And to the extent that moral suasion is important in the present circumstances in which we find a lack of confidence wherever we look, I would certainly echo what I have said before and what the Governing Council has said, namely that we call on our banks to be as active lenders as possible in the present circumstances. As regards deflation, we have not changed our diagnosis – we do not see any substantiation or materialisation of deflationary risk. We see ourselves in a disinflationary episode. At the moment, we continue to deem our medium-term inflation expectations to be soundly anchored. That, by the way, is one of the most important successes of this institution. When I look at the medium term, I am looking at the inflation expectations expressed in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and we will have to see what it says in a month’s time, but thus far since the setting up of the euro these expectations have fluctuated between 1.7% and 2%. And the last reading that we had was 1.9%. When your definition of price stability over the medium term is less than 2%, close to 2%, it is difficult to find something that would be much better than this oscillation between 1.7% and 1.9%. I said on behalf of the Governing Council that the disinflationary process that we are facing and which is due predominantly to the prices of oil and commodities will continue to push the consumer price index downwards – we are currently at 0.6 %, and we are likely to see it go below zero. That, of course, depends on the price of oil, but I hope that the price of oil will not go up again. And all this is something that we should not confuse with deflation, because – on the contrary – it is a factor that is expansionary, because we are distributing purchasing power to our fellow citizens through lower prices of oil and commodities. That having been said, we will continue to be very alert and we look permanently at our inflation expectations. We constantly look at the various indicators that we have at hand and that could substantiate the deflationary risk, but we do not see materialisation of such a risk at the moment. Now I will hand over to the Vice-President. Papademos: Very briefly, my remarks last week consisted of two parts. I mentioned potential further non-standard measures that may be taken. As the President has already emphasised, we have taken a number of non-standard measures in the past. Such measures aim at improving the functioning of credit markets and facilitating the financing of the economy. At the same time, I emphasised that the Governing Council has taken no decision concerning the need for or the nature of these measures. So the two statements together do not suggest that there was an intension to prepare the markets for an implementation of such measures. First about the May meeting: Is this going to be an important rate meeting as well? And do you think in general that it is important that when non-standard measures are announced they are accompanied by rate cuts, as some Governing Council members have said that this would increase their effectiveness? And the second question is, the OECD has cut its estimate for euro area growth this year to -4.1%. Do you think that this is an overly pessimistic view of the economy? Regarding your first question, I said that 1.25% was not the lowest level that we have decided ex ante. And I have nothing to add to that. We are never pre-committed. As you know, we will do what we judge appropriate at any time. I said also that it would be a measured decision. As regards the OECD, I make no judgement myself as to whether any projections are better or worse than others. As you know, we look at our own staff projections, but we do not underwrite them. We make a judgement on the basis of this very important input, but we look at all projections. When I look at all these projections, it seems to me that it is true that the OECD projections appear at this moment in time to be more negative than the private sector projections and the other public sector projections, including those of the IMF. We will see. We are in a world which is difficult and uncertain. I would just draw your attention to something I said a month ago. When we issued our last projections, I told you that of course they did not incorporate the 50 basis point decrease in interest rates that we had only just decided upon. They do not, by definition, incorporate the 25 basis point cut of today. So there has been a further 75 basis point reduction overall, for all three of our interest rates, that is now incorporated. This is one of the reasons why we said that we felt that the risks for inflation, in particular, were balanced, because we also take into account the decisions that have been taken since the last set of projections was issued. But we have to remain extraordinarily pragmatic and humble in the presence of facts and figures in a period in which uncertainty is greater than ever. No, we have certainly not changed our diagnosis at the level of the euro area as a whole and I will not comment on one particular event. I would say that it is a process. Everybody knows about the developments regarding real estate, not only in Spain but in a number of other countries also. So I have nothing particular to say and we certainly have not changed our diagnosis at all because of that event. Secondly, am I correct in thinking now that basically what you are telling us today is that, as far as conventional steps go, you have reached the limit. There is not much more you can do and now the ECB is in effect switching mode and looking more exclusively at the non-standard measures. Is that the frame of the debate within the Governing Council at the moment? And on that specifically, you have made a lot of references in speeches recently to what you call enhanced credit support working within the banking system. Do you think that policy is continuing to work? Is the banking system continuing to improve? In other words, is it not going to be necessary to circumvent the banking system in the way that the FED and the Bank of England have done? In other words, is the need for outright purchases less in the euro area than elsewhere? I would say on the first point that my reading of the market rates and of the expectations that can be extracted from the money market was that they saw a probability of 50% for a decrease of 50 basis points and 100% for a decrease of at least 25 basis points. So I would not say that it is as simple as you said. I would certainly echo what you said about the deposit rate, although there was no real mathematical extraction of information from the market that would substantiate a 25 basis point decrease in only the deposit rate. It was more the reasoning of economists or specialist experts. They were not wrong on that particular point as we can see. And I can only tell you that we have judged that it was appropriate, taking all factors into account, to decrease the rate on the main refinancing operations by 25 basis points while, at the same time, we have not decided that this is the lowest point that could be attained. It is as simple as that. It is the result of a very in-depth discussion and weighing of the various arguments. I will only mention one of them, which is that we have been quite satisfied so far with our decision to widen the de facto corridor for the very short term money market rates between the rate on the main refinancing operations and the deposit rate. And with regard to maintaining the width of this corridor, which has served us very well in the recent past, there was no particular or decisive reason not to continue. But this may not be true in the future. So I do not rule out the possibility that we could reduce the width of the corridor. On the non-standard measures, we are already fully engaged in non-standard measures. And we were the first, as perhaps you remember, to embark upon very audacious and bold measures, including the unlimited supply of liquidity at fixed rates. We did that to cover the end of the year in 2007, with very bold decisions at the time, and after the intensification of the crisis we were extremely prompt in embarking upon this unlimited supply of liquidity. We were also the first to supply liquidity at longer maturities – not only of one week but of three months and six months. And this confirms that the ECB has the capacity to adopt non-standard measures in the main area of the financing of our economy, namely the 70% of the financing of the economy which goes through commercial banks, according to the figures for outstanding financing. We will tell you at our next meeting how we intend to go further in terms of non-standard measures. I do not want to pre-empt in any respect what we may say then. Rest assured that we will ensure that, by so doing, we optimise the appropriate help that we can offer to our economy with regard to the enhanced credit support in particular. Secondly, you’ve used this interesting word “measured”. I imagine you would call all the ECB’s decisions “measured”. So maybe you could help us to understand the difference between the kind of “measured” decision you took... Today’s decision was “measured” in this respect. And then finally, you’ve given us the “when” on non-standard measures, but the “if” remains outstanding. Is that because you haven’t decided on how to implement such measures, or because you haven’t decided yet whether there is a need? And if you haven’t decided yet whether there is a need, what could change between now and next month to push you into deciding whether there is a need? We will meet next month as regards the non-standard measures. And as I have said, we are examining carefully all elements that would allow us to be convinced at the level of the Governing Council that we are optimising what could be done, and should be done, in our view, to enhance credit support and be sure that we have an optimised set of non-standard measures. And let me just say – and this is not a comment on those particular future decisions; it’s also a general comment – that we are extremely keen on preserving what we consider essential in the present circumstances, namely the fact that this institution, the ECB, is an anchor of stability and confidence, and that all that we do must be understood and perceived as such by our fellow citizens. You know that the confidence of our fellow citizens is the most important thing today. We have many economic difficulties in particular because our fellow citizens have lost some of their confidence. So we have to continue to be able to tell them “you can trust us; we will do all that is necessary, as we have done in the past, we will do what is called for in the circumstances”. Remember that we were the first – and we were criticised for it – to diagnose that we were in a very difficult situation and that we had to take bold measures. It was 9 August 2007. At the same time, it is essential that we preserve their confidence that we will continue to deliver price stability in line with our definition in the medium and long run. This is an essential component of their confidence today. I’m reading the papers, I’m reading articles, including the popular press, and I’m struck by the fact that the debate on what tomorrow and the day after tomorrow will bring for us and for our children is an open question. We have to be very careful in this respect. I say that just to give you an idea of our thinking when taking this decision. In any case, when we meet after the next monetary policy meeting, I will tell you what has been decided for the non-standard measures. No. Exchange rate questions are not part of what we are presently discussing. And on exchange rates, as you know, I have a very clear message: I stick to the last G7 communiqué. And I also noted the – again, very important – statement made recently by the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States and the President of the United States. That’s not a scoop; I have said that already. Thank you for your question; it is a very simple one. I would say no. No, we considered that the situation was such that it was appropriate to decrease rates. Well, we are in real time, and I will wait until the communiqué is published and will not comment at this stage. I will only tell you, although you know that, already that I participated as actively as possible in the ministers and governors’ meeting that took place in Brighton. It was, in my opinion a very good meeting. It was a good preparation, and I was heartened to see that there was a good deal of consensus in particular between the emerging world and the industrialised world. Let us not forget that the G20 is this new informal institution where you have precisely both the emerging world and the developing world, and where you have all systemic economies. So, I was impressed by the degree of consensus that existed, at the level of ministers and governors, between all those which are instrumental and systemic in the present global economy. But again, let us wait for what is being decided in London. Personally, I am optimistic. "
05/03/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided today to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 50 basis points. This decision brings the total reduction in the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem since 8 October 2008 to 275 basis points. Overall, inflation rates have decreased significantly and are now expected to remain well below 2% over 2009 and 2010. This outlook for inflation is due to the fall in commodity prices and diminishing domestic price and cost pressures, reflecting the severe downturn in economic activity. Indeed, recent economic data releases and survey information add further evidence to our assessment that both global and euro area demand are likely to be very weak in 2009. Over the course of 2010, the economy is expected to gradually recover. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation at rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. After today’s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations, which supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, the world economy has weakened substantially in recent months, affecting increasingly also emerging market economies. In a climate of heightened uncertainty, a severe fall in world trade volumes has been accompanied by a pronounced decline in domestic demand in the euro area. As a consequence, euro area real GDP contracted markedly in the fourth quarter of 2008, by 1.5% on a quarterly basis, according to Eurostat’s first estimate. Available data and survey indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area remained weak in early 2009. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects that both global and domestic demand will decline in 2009 but thereafter recover gradually. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which place annual real GDP growth in a range of -3.2% to -2.2% in 2009, and between -0.7% and +0.7% in 2010. These ranges represent a downward revision of the December 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. In both 2009 and 2010, the annual GDP growth rate will be significantly reduced by negative carry-over effects from the previous year. The projected gradual recovery in 2010 reflects the effects of the substantial macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as of the extensive policy measures that have been introduced to restore the functioning of the financial system, both inside and outside the euro area. In addition, the fall in commodity prices is expected to support real disposable income and consumption in the period ahead. The outlook for the economy continues to be surrounded by uncertainty. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to the economic outlook now appear to be more balanced. On the one hand, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects, also on confidence, stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and reflecting other policy measures taken. On the other hand, concerns relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as to the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has been steadily declining since the middle of 2008, when it reached a peak of 4.0%. In February 2009 it was 1.2%, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, broadly unchanged from 1.1% in January. The decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp falls in global commodity prices over this period. However, signs of a more broad-based reduction in inflationary risks are also increasingly emerging. Reflecting these trends, the March 2009 ECB staff inflation projections constitute a significant downward revision compared with the previous projections and foresee annual HICP inflation at between 0.1% and 0.7% in 2009. Owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices, headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months, possibly temporarily reaching negative levels around mid-year. Thereafter, annual inflation is expected to increase again, also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments. Accordingly, it is likely that HICP inflation rates will fluctuate noticeably during 2009. Such short-term volatility is, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. For 2010, ECB staff project HICP inflation at between 0.6% and 1.4%. This range also represents a substantial downward revision compared with the December 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, mainly reflecting the change in the economic growth outlook. Available forecasts from international organisations have also been revised downwards and broadly confirm an outlook of moderate inflation rates in 2010. As in the case of growth, a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounds the inflation projections. Risks to these projections are broadly balanced. They relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data and estimates provide further evidence of an ongoing deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area. This implies a further reduction in inflationary risks in the medium term. The further deceleration in underlying monetary dynamics has contrasted with the high month-to-month volatility of developments in M3 and its components which has been observed since the financial turmoil intensified in September 2008. This relates in particular to marketable instruments, but also to the significant substitution that is taking place between different categories of deposits included in M3. While annual M3 growth declined further, to 5.9%, in January 2009, the annual growth rate of the narrow aggregate M1, which includes the most liquid assets, rose to 5.2%. Volatility also characterised the flow of MFI loans to the private sector around the turn of the year, with a monthly contraction in the outstanding amount in December followed by a significantly positive flow in January. However, discounting a possible turn-of-the-year effect and looking beyond these latest developments confirms the decline in the growth of bank credit to households and non-financial corporations observed in 2008. At the same time, it appears that the substantial past reduction in the key ECB interest rates is increasingly being passed through to bank lending rates, indicating that, despite the tensions in financial markets, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is not significantly hampered in the euro area. Still, more data and analysis are needed to firmly assess the outlook for credit in the period ahead. To sum up, inflation rates have decreased significantly and are now expected to remain well below 2% over 2009 and 2010. Recent economic data releases and survey information add further evidence to our assessment that both global and euro area demand are likely to be very weak in 2009. Over the course of 2010, the economy is expected to gradually recover. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation at rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. After today’s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations, which supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding the fiscal policy responses to the economic downturn, the euro area countries’ updated stability programmes and recent addenda confirm the prospect of a sharp and broad-based deterioration in euro area public finances. A credible commitment to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions, respecting fully the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, is necessary to maintain the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances, which is important both for the economy to recover and for supporting long-term growth. In this respect, we support the Commission’s intention to initiate excessive deficit procedures for several countries. This is crucial to preserve the credibility of the EU fiscal surveillance framework. It is important that clear deadlines are set for correction of the excessive deficits and that consolidation plans are based on firm and well-specified structural measures. As regards structural policies, it remains important to pursue economic policies in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition. In this respect, it is essential that government support measures do not distort competition and delay necessary structural adjustment, and it is of the utmost importance to avoid protectionist measures. Refraining from protectionism will be key to allowing the global economy to overcome the current crisis more rapidly. The successful completion of the Doha round of trade negotiations would also be a milestone towards a more integrated and open world economy for the benefit of all. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * Secondly, on the issue of quantitative easing, there has been a lot of discussion about quantitative easing not only with the ECB, of course, but with the ECB sparked by remarks by Axel Weber and Christian Noyer referring to commercial paper programmes, and that the ECB could embark on buying commercial papers. Was that discussed, has that been an issue? And in that context, thirdly, with that, how concerned are you at the ECB that the ECB’s balance sheet is getting longer and longer and, in fact, there has been a great deal of quantitative easing already? On your first question, we had, as always, an in-depth discussion on the present situation, on all the observations, which were made, on all figures, on staff projections and on the appropriate policy decision in the present circumstances. After this thorough discussion we concluded by a consensus on the decision which we took. I have just mentioned what we did as regards interest rates. I emphasise the fact that we decided to diminish our main refinancing operation rate by 50 basis points. We also decided not to change the width of the corridor, which is, between the deposit facility and the main refinancing rate, a full percentage point. So, we decided today to put our deposit facility at the level of 0.50%, which is very, very low. This decision to put our deposit facility at that level - taking into account the fact that the unlimited supply of liquidity is driving the overnight rate quite close to the deposit facility - is of great importance. We also decided today, which will be elaborated in a press release that you will have immediately after this press conference, to continue the fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment for all main refinancing operations, special-term refinancing operations and supplementary and regular longer-term refinancing operations for as long as needed and in any case beyond the end of 2009. And we have decided to continue with the current frequency and maturity profile of the supplementary longer-term refinancing operations and special-term refinancing operations for as long as needed and in any case beyond the end of 2009. These are the decisions which we have taken today. As regards your second question on quantitative easing or non-standard measures – this would be the way I would describe these measures – as you have underlined yourself, we are already using non-standard measures. I think you were absolutely right to say that. With the very substantial enlargement of the eligibility of our collateral, and that in combination with the supply of liquidity on an unlimited basis which has been decided by the Governing Council, we are using non-standard measures, which have had important consequences. I mentioned one of the consequences as regards the positioning of the EONIA rate. Another consequence is that our own balance sheet has augmented substantially, and, if you wish to have an order of magnitude we have an augmentation of the risk that we are taking ourselves in our own balance sheet since the start of the turbulences in August 2007, which is of the order of magnitude of 600 billion euro, of the order of magnitude of 800 billion dollars. This represents a little bit more than 6% of the GDP of the euro area, so this is substantial. As regards further non-standard measures, on top of the two measures I have mentioned, on top of what we have decided today – to say that we would continue as long as needed and beyond the end of the year – we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures. I will not elaborate on that; we had absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure. I don’t exclude anything. I will give you a rendezvous when, if and when, we decide. Then I would be happy to explain what we have decided. Again, we are studying possible additional non-standard measures. And my second question would be relating to potential non-conventional measures you may embark on in the future. Some of the non-conventional measures used by other central banks very much depend on the cooperation and indemnity of their treasuries, like the Bank of England or the Fed depend on their finance ministries to provide indemnity for any sort of default on commercial papers or anything else. So in the absence of a single European treasury, have you started discussions or pushed for discussions with various finance ministers or at the Eurogroup level to come to some sort of conclusion? I believe Mr Juncker was at the meeting today, was that raised at any level? Or was it raised at some sort of seminar or anything else? As regards your first question, I confirm what I have already said: we see a number of drawbacks associated with a zero rate level. As regards the present level of the main refinancing operations, we did not decide ex-ante that this was the lowest point that we could attain. Further decisions will depend on facts, figures and judgement of the Governing Council. As regards your second question on the non-standard measures, there is no pre-commitment for any kind of non-standard measure. I exclude nothing. It would be the decision of the Governing Council and we are looking at it. At this stage there has been no discussion with executive branches as regards any help or any guarantees or any support that could be given. And it is not an avenue which fits necessarily correctly with our own framework. We did not ask for any kind of help when we engaged in this very important consequence of the non-standard measures, namely the increase in the size of our overall balance sheet. That being said, if we exclude nothing, there is nothing that would substantiate such an avenue at this stage. Secondly, I’m not an economist and maybe I’m a little bit confused. You say in the statement “after today’s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term”. If I did the maths right, in 2010 the mid-point is 1% and both 0.6 and 1.4 are well below your definition of price stability, so what am I missing? And my last question, you also said today’s decision was a consensual decision – could you give us a little bit more detail on that, what were the other options discussed? On the non-standard measures, we are discussing of course both the need and the process. And any decision would suppose that we see the need and that we agree on the process. On price stability, we have the staff projections – although we do not ourselves underwrite the staff projections, they are the judgement of the staff. Let me mention just one point among many others: the present methodology is based upon existing market interest rates, the observation of the yield curve and the evolution of market interest rates. It is part of a methodology that is very much an agreed methodology, generally considered to be state of the art. Before the methodology just mentioned, we had another methodology which used the working assumption that you take the interest rates where they are and they do not change: Interest rate policy was unchanged in the previous methodology. According to various models of the euro area economy if our staff would still use the previous methodology, the projections would display substantially more growth and significantly more inflation in the euro area economy. And if I take the level of interest rates that we have decided today – not the interest rates which existed at the moment of the projections – then the impact would be even higher in terms of growth and inflation. Our decision today takes into account precisely the fact that we are not passive ourselves, and we use all information available to make our judgments. So we trust, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, that with today’s decision we are ensuring price stability over the medium term. Regarding your third question, I will confirm that there was a consensus, after a very in-depth discussion as we are in a very multi-dimensional, complex and uncertain world. And, secondly, there are a lot of issues around at the moment, but, just to focus on one or two: if we talked about classic quantitative easing in the true sense of the form that the Bank of England has announced today, would you imagine such a programme being either effective or practical in the context of the eurozone? I am not asking if you are going to do it, but given that economists seem to argue that quantitative easing does work do you think they are correct? And third, if I might just ask you to comment on the situation in eastern European economies, and specifically the role that the European Central Bank might take in the future. What would your message be to politicians from some of those countries who are suggesting the ECB could do more, for instance by accepting collateral in assets from some of the local currencies? On the first question, as I said, we did not decide ex-ante that we were at the lowest level. If justified by facts and figures, if some of the risks that I mentioned are materialising, I clearly won’t rule out the main policy rate being changed, indeed going down. That is clear. I will also mention the fact that, as regards the interest rate of the deposit facility the present level, which is 0.5%, is already a very, very low rate. These are the two comments I will make in response to your first question. On your second question, again, we are reflecting on what is likely to be done. You know that we are in a different situation in comparison with other sister institutions over the Channel or over the Atlantic. We do not have the same financial system in front of us. From the outset, we have been extraordinarily forthcoming in comparison with the other central banks as regards collateral. We have even enlarged the list of eligible collateral. The commercial banks are playing a much more important role in the euro area than it is the case in the United States in particular, but perhaps also in the United Kingdom. So it is not surprising that we have concentrated our attention on commercial banks and on being as forthcoming as possible as regards this channel. On top of the openness to the eligibility of collateral, you will remember that we were the first to go for longer-term refinancing. We are engaging in this unlimited supply of liquidity on a longer-term basis, and today we have taken a new very important decision to pursue this concept of unlimited refinancing for as long as needed and at least beyond the end of the year. All this shows that, as regards non-standard measures, we are concentrating very much on what fits the very structure of the euro area. That being said, we do not feel that we should exclude other operations. At this stage I would prefer to qualify them – and this is also the way Ben Bernanke is qualifying such operations – more as credit easing than quantitative easing. Again, in terms of quantity, we already have a very significant level of non-standard quantitative risk-taking that is very visible. In response to your final question on eastern Europe at this stage our position would be that it is extremely important that we do not change any frameworks. We have established rules concerning membership of ERM II or the euro. And sticking to the rules as they are is very important for the stability of the European Union as a whole. It is not good to suggest that some are in such a weak situation that you would amend the rules for the sake of that situation. I feel that it is important to stick to the present framework as it is. And secondly, another question on the non-standard measures: If you cannot tell us what measures the Council would prefer at the moment, could you at least give us a sort of time frame for when a decision on this might take place. Or do you think you have unlimited time to decide when to pursue those non-standard measures, because time is a bit short at the moment, is it not? On your first question, time is short and that is why we are taking important decisions. We have taken important decisions in the past few months and we have taken important decisions today with commitments that go beyond the end of the year. As regards your second question on non-standard measures, as I said we are in discussions. I am not ruling anything out. We are not pre-committed to anything. When the time comes, you will know what we have decided. And I shall give you regular updates at our press briefings, but I do not pre-commit to any particular time. In any case, we have proved that we have been able to take decisions at any time when necessary including in exceptional unforeseen circumstances. And, as I have repeatedly said today, uncertainty is the mark of the time. With regard to why we think that zero interest rates would be very inconvenient, I will not elaborate any further. It is clearly an assessment that we have made. And my second question is: you know that there are also preparations in the euro area by politicians on how to assist countries in trouble within the euro area, not eastern Europe. I was wondering whether you would say you support these preparations or would you say that this goes too far and violates the Treaty? On your first question, we are looking very carefully and constantly at the possible risk of deflation – as the OECD and the IMF are doing. The conclusion of the international institutions in general is that such risks are very minimal in our case. And one of the reasons why they are very minimal is that, to substantiate deflation, not only inflation on the basis of the CPI observed during a sufficiently long period of time must be negative but must it must also drive inflation expectations themselves to be negative, so that you have the downward spiral that characterises deflation. In our case, thanks to our definition of price stability and thanks to the very clear understanding by economic agents such as seen via the Survey of Professional Forecasters, since the introduction of the euro we have had quite a remarkable anchoring of inflation expectations. And when you look at the medium-term inflation expectations, whether they are extracted from surveys or whether they are extracted from the financial markets, on a medium-term basis they are very well-anchored. We must take care of that, it is not something which can be taken for granted eternally, but it helps us considerably in circumstances in which there are significant inflationary risks. We proved that we were able to weather periods which were very demanding in times of upside risks for inflation. It helps us also very much to weather periods in which, on the contrary, there might be downward pressure on inflation. So no, there is no substantiation of any significant risk of deflation and we are considerably helped by our definition of price stability and by the anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. As regards your second question on the issue of members of the euro area that could be in extreme difficulty, first of all the euro area is an area where you have considerable automatic help through the very existence of the single currency itself. For instance the balance of payment deficit, if any, is financed automatically by virtue of belonging to the euro area. Let us not forget that. I say regularly when I am asked more direct questions that I do not comment on absurd hypotheses. I have confidence in the capacity of the governments of the euro area, in line with their own pre-eminent responsibility, to convince their own people and the markets that they are going in the right direction and that they are credible as regards the medium- to long-term path for sound fiscal policies that I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council in the introductory remarks. A second question regarding the rules you apply to entering the euro zone. Those of us within this room know you are very attached to the Treaty but you do have some flexibility on how you define the best performing three members of the euro zone in calculating the inflation target. At this point that formula seems a bit odd, because it would suggest that countries need to deflate in order to meet criteria, which I am sure you do not want them to do. Have you given any thought in this direction to whether this is still appropriate going forward? And for my third question, I would like to hear your thoughts on what you feel western Europe’s responsibilities are to the new EU Member States that joined in 2004. There is a situation of mutual dependence there in many ways, it is obviously not standard procedure to ”so to speak” grab your neighbours under the arms in difficult times in the EU, but these are not normal times. What are your thoughts on that? On your first question we mentioned that the pass-through was functioning in a way which was not significantly hampered. That is the description we are using. It is true that when we look at the functioning of our money market and the impact that we have through our policy decisions on the EURIBOR market interest rates, including three-month interest rates for instance, we have observed that the functioning of the money market and the pass-through of these monetary policy decisions was not significantly hampered. This is not to say that we exclude ex-ante additional non-standard measures, because I said that if it functions quite well in our judgement, despite the acute tensions that we have to cope with it is precisely because we have taken non-standard measures. Again, to be clear on the response to your question, we would not exclude other non-standard measures. On your second question at this stage we are in agreement with the European Commission and with the governments as a group in considering that it is not appropriate to reflect on transforming or loosening the criteria. We do not think that it would help anybody at this stage, neither the countries concerned nor the euro area itself. On the third point, I would make the following comments. You mention “western Europe” so your question is independent of belonging or not to the euro area. You assume it is possible to make a distinction between the western part of Europe and the eastern part of Europe, which I do not like since we are all on exactly the same footing and the only pertinent differences for me are that some are members of the euro area, others are members of ERM II, others are members of the European Union without being members of the euro area or ERM II and others are out of the European Union itself. And one could also say that you have candidate countries and non-candidate countries. So these are the pertinent distinctions that you can make between the various countries. The European countries in general themselves, and particularly the eastern and central European countries, are very keen on saying that they exist in their own right and that they have their own economic and financial features and characteristics. Some of them would say that they are in a situation which is difficult and would ask for help, while others would say that they are in a situation which is solid and strong and resilient and they should not all be confused. If and when particular countries might have major difficulties, it is always possible, as has been proved in several cases, that there is help available from the European Union itself and from the European Commission and which is backed by governments. There is additional help, which can be given on a bilateral basis, as has been the case for Latvia for instance. There is also help which can come from international institutions, such when the IMF is involved. We ourselves, as we have done for some countries, can have repo agreements that would also be helpful in those circumstances. But that is for those countries that have an exceptional difficulty and that are calling for help to finance a recovery programme that is convincing. But we are all on the same continent and we must all care for our own resilience, because the resilience of the euro area itself is very important for all our partners. Our first duty is to understand that we are all interdependent and that it is very important that we continue to be “good clients” for the eastern and central European countries that are exporting to the euro area. I will not comment more on that. That is an excellent question, because I wanted to say a word on that. So, I would first mention the European Central Bank itself. We approved today the audited annual accounts of the ECB for the year ending 31 December 2008. At the end of this press conference you will have the press release. We had a surplus in 2008 of €2.661 billion, which compares with a surplus of €286 million in 2007 that reflected very much the effects of the euro’s appreciation against the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen. So again we had a surplus of approximately €2.7 billion in 2008. As regards the risk exposure of the ECB, based upon our assessment, an amount of €1.339 billion was transferred from this surplus to the provision that we are making against foreign exchange risk, interest rate and gold price risks. So we declared a net result of €1.322 billion. The provision would be used to cover possible losses arising from the risks that I mentioned. Today we have decided to distribute the remaining €116 million, because we had already transferred to the national central banks the bulk of the net result, namely €1.2 billion. You will have all the details in a press release after the press conference. Now, I would like to refer to the Eurosystem monetary policy operations in 2008, not only at the level of the ECB, but at the level of the Eurosystem as a whole. The income from monetary policy operations is expected to amount to around €28.7 billion in 2008, which is superior to what we had observed in 2007 for Eurosystem income from monetary operations. In 2007 we had €23.2 billion. If I now take the aggregate net result of the Eurosystem national central banks, including the distribution of the net result that the ECB has been distributed to the NCBs and which goes onto their own balance sheet, then this net result is estimated to be approximately €16.8 billion for 2008. The year before, the aggregate net result was €15.2 billion. Again this information will be detailed in a press release, which will be available after the press conference. In the autumn of 2008 we had five counterparties that defaulted on refinancing operations undertaken by the Eurosystem, namely Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG, three subsidiaries of Icelandic banks, and Indover NL. The total nominal value of the Eurosystem’s claims on these credit institutions amounted to some €10.3 billion at the end of 2008. We have looked at this, and the decision we have taken is that any shortfall, if it were to materialise, on the amount of claims that we have, should eventually be shared in full by the Eurosystem NCBs in accordance with Article 32.4 of the Statute of the ESCB, in proportion to the prevailing ECB capital key shares of these NCBs in 2008. As a matter of prudence, we also decided at the level of the Governing Council, that the NCBs should establish their respective shares of an appropriate total provision in their annual accounts for 2008 as a buffer against possible risks arising for the monetary policy operations. The size of the total provision at the level of the Eurosystem as a whole will amount to €5.7 billion. The net figures I gave you – for the level of the net result of the Eurosystem - namely approximately €16.8 billion is calculated after this provisioning. Exactly the same applies to the ECB. The ECB has made provisions and the net result we have distributed to the national central banks was after our provision. To give you an idea of the order of magnitude of our provisioning, when I pile up all the provisioning we have made in the ECB – I am speaking of the ECB alone, and not of the Eurosystem – that it is now around €4 billion. It is the total provisioning we have made in order to face up to potential risks. Again, we will do whatever is necessary and I will not comment more on future decisions. I said that we had not decided ex-ante that we are at the lowest point as regards the main refinancing operation interest rate. I also mentioned that at 0.5% the deposit interest rate was at a very, very low level, also taking into account that the unlimited supply of liquidity which we operate, and are bound to operate for a long period of time, is something which pushes down the EONIA, not far away from the level of this deposit facility interest rate. That is the only remark I make, but you, of course, took it rightly so. Our hands are not tied at all. We will do whatever we judge appropriate, taking into account the situation. We are not exactly in the same situation as the United States or the United Kingdom, and everybody knows that. So we have to optimise what we do. As regards the set of non-standard measures, I have already said that we have already adopted a large number of non-standard measures, and I can elaborate more on that. We will do what we judge appropriate. Our hands are not tied; I am ruling nothing out, as I have said. If our hands were tied in a certain direction, I would say at this stage that we had a sense that we were ruling out this or that. But I’m not saying that. I’m not committing myself to anything, and the fact that sister institutions are doing this or that does not mean that we should do the same. I have said, since the very beginning we have been in a very different situation. We also have to take into account the fact that the commercial banks are our main channel on this side of the Atlantic, by comparison with the other side of the Atlantic. Now, let me say, in order to ensure that you don’t miss any information, that the next Governing Council meeting and press conference on 2 April will take place here, and not in Italy, as it had been envisaged at a certain point in time. So, I want to make it clear that the next meeting will be in Frankfurt. We will have the external meeting in Luxembourg on 2 July. You know that and it is published on the website. I just wanted to confirm that. And it is on 8 October that we will be in Italy. "
05/02/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As anticipated in our interest rate decision of 15 January 2009, the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the euro area and its major trading partners are undergoing an extended period of significant economic downturn, and that accordingly both external and domestic inflationary pressures are diminishing. We continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. This assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. It is also confirmed by the further deceleration in monetary and credit growth in the euro area. Fully in line with its primary objective, the Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in accordance with its definition of price stability, that is inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Overall, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the intensified and broadened financial market turmoil, economic activity throughout the world, including in the euro area, has weakened substantially. Foreign demand for euro area exports has declined, and domestic factors, notably very low confidence and tight financing conditions, have adversely affected domestic demand. Taken together with other available economic data for the euro area, this points to very negative quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the last quarter of 2008. This information is in line with our current analysis and forward-looking assessment. We continue to see persistent weakness in economic activity in the euro area over the coming quarters, as the financial market tensions have a further impact on the global and domestic economy. At the same time, the very substantial fall in commodity prices seen since the middle of 2008 should support real disposable income, and thus consumption, in the period ahead. Most recently, there have been tentative signs of stabilisation in some survey data, albeit at historically low levels. These indications, however, require confirmation on a broader basis. In the view of the Governing Council, the outlook for the economy remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty. Overall, risks to economic growth remain clearly on the downside. They relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as to concerns about the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. Over time, the euro area should reap the benefit of the effects of significant policy measures that have been decided upon over recent months to deal with the financial turmoil. They should help to restore trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households. In order to ensure that such measures effectively support a sustainable recovery, it is of the utmost importance that they remain focused and temporary in nature so as to maintain a stability-oriented and medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation continued to decline in January 2009, falling to 1.1%, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, from 1.6% in December 2008. While no detailed breakdown for HICP developments in January is available as yet, the decline in headline inflation observed since the middle of 2008 primarily reflects the sharp falls in global commodity prices over this period, owing mainly to weak global demand. Looking ahead, lower commodity prices and the prospect of weak demand confirm our assessment of mid-January that inflationary pressures in the euro area are diminishing. Owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices, headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months, possibly reaching very low levels at mid-year. However, also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments, inflation rates are expected to increase again in the second half of the year. Accordingly, it is likely that HICP inflation rates will fluctuate sharply during 2009. Such short-term volatility is, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, annual HICP inflation is expected to be in line with price stability. This assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. Regarding risks to price stability over the medium term, unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation, while upside risks to price stability could materialise, particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed. It is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest evidence confirms a continued deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area, supporting the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing. In analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil since September 2008 has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly. It has already had a substantial impact on the behaviour of market participants, as indicated by recent money and credit data. Both the broad aggregate M3 and, in particular, the components of M3 that are most closely related to the ongoing financial tensions – such as holdings of money market funds – have shown high month-to-month volatility of late. Overall, looking to the extent possible through this volatility, the underlying pace of broad money expansion continues to decelerate gradually from the peak seen in early 2007. However, the intensification of financial tensions since September 2008 is leading to significant substitution among the components of M3. Turning to the evolution of bank credit, the flow of MFI loans to the private sector moderated in the course of 2008, largely on account of weakness in loans to households, especially for house purchase. In December, however, outstanding MFI loans to non-financial corporations contracted for the first time since the onset of the financial turmoil, confirming the significant weakening of corporate credit at the end of the year after a long period of dynamic growth. At the same time, the substantial reduction in key ECB interest rates since October 2008 appears to have been passed through to lower bank lending rates, thereby easing financing conditions for companies and households. Moreover, there are some indications that the pace of tightening of bank credit standards is stabilising, albeit at high levels by historical standards. Overall, the incoming information on financing conditions requires continuous close monitoring. To sum up, as anticipated in our interest rate decision of 15 January 2009, the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the euro area and its major trading partners are undergoing a period of significant economic downturn, and that accordingly both external and domestic inflationary pressures are diminishing. We continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. This assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. It is also confirmed by a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis, against the background of a further deceleration in monetary and credit growth in the euro area. Fully in line with its primary objective, the Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in accordance with its definition of price stability, that is inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Overall, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Turning to fiscal policy, the European Commission projects in its January 2009 interim forecast a substantial rise in the average euro area government budget deficit, to 4.0% of GDP this year, from 1.7% in 2008. This rapid deterioration of the fiscal position is broad-based among euro area countries and is due to the economic downturn, additional revenue shortfalls and the fiscal stimulus measures adopted by many governments. In 2009 seven euro area countries are currently expected by the Commission to exceed the 3% of GDP reference value for the budget deficit. In addition, many governments have assumed large contingent liabilities in connection with the guarantees provided to banks and will need to finance the capital injections in support of the financial sector. To support the public’s confidence in the sustainability of public finances, it is therefore essential that governments return to a credible commitment to medium-term budgetary objectives as soon as possible. As regards structural policies, it is important to continue on the long-term reform path foreseen by the Lisbon agenda. At the current juncture, it is essential to pursue economic policies in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, resisting any protectionist pressure. Moreover, product and services market reforms should foster competition and help to speed up effective restructuring. Labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions. This will be particularly important for those areas and sectors hit strongly by the negative demand shock. In several countries, it is also crucial to take measures with a view to addressing competitiveness losses accumulated over recent years. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * My second question is: will next month be the last important meeting, or do you see scope that there are more important meetings to come? And the final question is: you have ruled out taking interest rates to zero. What do you consider to be the floor for ECB interest rates? Would 1% be appropriate and what then would happen to the deposit rate? I will only confirm what I have said, namely that 2% is not the lowest level that we would have decided ex ante, second, that zero interest rates at the present time is not something that we would consider appropriate. It remains to be seen what we will do in our next meeting. We will have a lot of new data and we will have our new staff projections, which are an important input, but we will also have projections that will have been updated by a number of private and public institutions and, of course, we will do whatever we judge necessary to maintain the solid anchoring of inflation expectations in line with our definition of less than, but close to, 2%. I will talk about that at our next meeting in a month’s time. Would the ECB consider embarking on additional alternative measures, such as quantitative easing, before official rates have dropped to zero? On your first question, I have nothing further to add to what I have said: a zero rate does not seem to us to be appropriate at this stage. On the non-standard action, we are in a non-standard mode at the present time since we are engaged in the unlimited supply of liquidity with maturities of from one week to six months. We are in a non-standard mode when we see that the balance sheet of the ECB and the Eurosystem has augmented significantly. None of this was considered at all likely before the intensification of the crisis that we have experienced since mid-September and the beginning of October last year. So, we have not pre-decided anything additional at this stage, and we have not ruled anything out, in terms of non-standard activity. And, of course, it means implicitly that we could continue to engage in non-standard operations without having decided to set a zero rate. As you have observed, we have reduced our rates by 225 basis points in the recent period. This was decided over a time span of approximately three months, which is absolutely exceptional and without any precedent. If I look at the short-term rates, for example the three-month EURIBOR, which is an important index, from the peak which was attained at the moment of the intensification of the crisis, to the present level, taking into account not only the reduction of our policy rate but also the reduction of abnormal spreads that had developed at the time, I see a reduction which is in the order of magnitude of three hundred basis points or even a little bit more. But that being said we are in a multi-dimensional and very complex situation and the real economy also has to cope with a number of other issues and constraints. My second question is: is it time to evaluate the level of long-term real interest rates, which have been substantially lower in the last decade than in the preceding four decades? And is it time to perhaps consider the fact that the levels of output and confidence to which the global economy is now returning are perhaps consistent with post-war real interest rate levels which may well have been more stable? On the first point, I have said already that 2% was not considered by the Governing Council to be a lower limit and that we would examine the situation at our next meeting on the basis of our monetary policy strategy and the information we will have. We have a needle in our compass which is very clear: less than 2%, but close to 2%, and we will take the appropriate decisions. I do not exclude that we could decrease rates in our next meeting. But again, we will see then exactly what we have to do, taking everything into account. As regards your second point, I will not embark on reflections about long-term interest rates or the accumulation of imbalances that we have observed in the global economy. I will only say that it is clear that we were not in a sustainable mode, at a sustainable pace, at the level of the global economy during the last years. And this is not something new because we had said it a number of times, including here on the occasion of these press conferences, the disorderly unwinding of global imbalances having been noted as a major risk in particular in the G7 communiqué and by us of course. I will not embark on further discussions of the inconveniences and drawbacks when you have a zero interest rate. But there are a number of drawbacks and we feel that we should avoid them. A second one, could you give us more of a preview of the Bank Lending Survey, which is out fairly soon? Would you also comment on whether it’s valid to argue that it’s a fallacy that reducing rates to zero means monetary policy becomes ineffective? First, on our attitude as regards the next meeting, we will look at the next meeting into facts and figures and will take the appropriate decision according to our own monetary policy strategy. We will take the decision that we will judge appropriate. I’m not embarking on qualifying the amplitude. But I have noted that what is - at the moment I’m speaking- present in the market would probably be more the first figure that you have mentioned. I don’t qualify what is presently embedded in the market. As regards your second question, as you know, we will publish the Bank Lending Survey tomorrow on our website. And we have decided – starting from April 2009 – that the results of the survey will be published around one week ahead of the respective Governing Council meeting, so the next one ahead of the meeting on 7 May 2009. On the present results let me only say that at this stage for the first quarter of 2008 the net tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises remained broadly at the high level of the previous quarter. And the most important driving forces behind the net tightening continued to be expectations about future economic activity and the industry or the firm-specific outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2008 we have a reporting of a further tightening in net terms of credit standards for loans to households, and for the first quarter of 2009 the banks expected a decline in the net tightening for all categories in comparison with the actual tightening in the fourth quarter of 2008. So some kind of stabilisation at the very high level of net tightening that we observed in the fourth quarter of 2008. That would be a summing-up of what I can say at this stage. But again we will publish the results tomorrow. As regards your third question I have no other comment on interest rates at zero. There are a significant number of drawbacks. I will not elaborate on that. A second question is, some countries, especially in Eastern Europe, are suffering severely from the global crisis. Some are part of the European Union but not of the eurozone, and they would be happy if they had support from the ECB. What is your judgement on this? In the future, can they hope for some help from the ECB in terms of liquidity provision and so on? On your first question, let me remind all of us that when we started to cope with the tensions on the markets in general – and it is already some time ago, in August 2007 – we were the central bank in the world that was the most open to eligibility of collateral in the form of private paper. And you know that other major central banks had to considerably change their own frameworks in order to be able to do more or less the same. But I would say, in this respect, that what we have been doing in being extraordinarily open to such paper is, in many respects, something which would have been described in other environments and other economies as close to non-standard easing. Or close to, I would say, credit easing perhaps, as you know is the term used on the other side of the Atlantic. And I would again mention the fact that we have to day the combination of, first, our unlimited supply of liquidity; second, very broad eligibility of collateral; and third, the fact that our balance sheet has considerably augmented in size. This is something which I could describe as a non-standard set of decisions that have augmented considerably, to say the least, our own risk-taking, because of the increase in the size of the balance sheet. Again, we are not in the same universe as the other central banks, and each of us does what we judge appropriate in our own universe. I said already that I did not exclude other possible non-standard measures. I would not say that we have constraints that explain why we could not introduce other non-standard measures. But at this stage I don’t want to elaborate more on that. When and if we have a decision I will explain that decision. As regards Eastern Europe we have looked at the situation. We have taken a number of decisions already, in particular repo agreements with certain central banks. At this stage, I consider that we have our own way of looking at it that has already been implemented in terms of effective decisions. I can only say that we will continue to follow the situation very closely. That all belongs to one set of questions. You have been vehement about the fact that you think a zero policy rate is not appropriate, but we have all been trying to get you to talk a little bit more about the overnight rate: would you also think an overnight rate at zero would not be appropriate? And thirdly, inflation expectations are sort of a hot topic because there is a question about whether or not the ECB wants its real rate to be negative. So, you have mentioned before that your favoured measure of inflation expectations is a five-year, five-year forward. Is there any reason now to be looking at shorter-term measures of inflation expectations? Those are far lower than the five-year rate. I do not want to repeat too lengthily what I have said, but I would say that, regarding risks to price stability over the medium term, unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation, whilst upside risks to price stability could materialise if the falling commodity prices were to reverse and if domestic pressures turn out to be stronger. We are, in this domain, in a situation where uncertainty is high. We are benefiting now from the disinflationary process, which, as I said, is likely to be very strong mid-year, in particular as regards headline inflation, because of the previous prices of oil and commodities and the expectation that the future prices of oil and commodities will continue to be at a low level. I must confess that I hope that the price of oil and commodities will remain at a low level, because it is something which is expansionary and in many respects an automatic stabiliser at the level of a global economy which is in great difficulty. But I also see that some are saying that the appropriate level of the price of oil would be USD 75, others are saying that they lose money if it is below such and such level and so forth. So we will see. Nobody knows what is likely to be the evolution of the price of oil and commodities, and that is something that we have to take into account. But I will certainly not qualify the absence or presence of the sentence that you mentioned as having any meaning at this stage. As I said, we see risks downward and we see risks upward, and these are very clear. I won’t comment any further on the zero. I will stick to what I said. Zero interest rates are not, in our opinion, at the current time, appropriate. Now let me turn to the inflation expectations. We are looking at all possible views and angles of vision for inflation expectations. We have the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and we have the private and public surveys that we are not responsible for. We have the information that we are extracting from the financial markets. We have the swap market and we have the bond market. And they are not necessarily giving all the same information. But I would say that, at the policy-relevant horizon, we see inflation expectations at present as being anchored in line with our definition of price stability. We are considerably helped by our precise definition of price stability. That is absolutely clear. As regards the Survey of Professional Forecasters, I can confirm to you – because we have advance figures which will be published later – that in the medium term they see inflation still at the level of 1.9%. A little bit lower than before, but at the level of 1.9%. This is a further indication of this medium-term anchoring. And I could say the same for what we are extracting from markets, even if, of course, the break-even on the basis of a very short number of years is influenced by what is expected in the present year. But if you are at the level of the five years forward, yes, you see that we have the desired anchoring of inflation expectations. I have to say at this stage that we remain prudent and cautious because, again, these are facts and figures and we have to look at it and to be permanently alert. But this is, in my opinion, proving that by being as explicit as possible on our definition of price stability, we are helping the anchoring of inflation expectations in the medium term. Also, when I compare some expectations on either side of the Atlantic, I see a big difference, obviously, between those expectations, and I take it that this is probably partially due to the fact that we ourselves are very clear on what our definition is. The other question, which is closely related to this, is: we all heard Mr Tremonti’s suggestion to have the EU issue a euro bond; would you think that this is a good idea? And what changes would be necessary to make this possible? On the first question, I must confess I do not see such a situation personally. I don’t remember having seen the IMF’s Managing Director mentioning that. I will look into it. But I can say that I do not see it myself. On the second point, in the ECB Governing Council we trust that it is good that each government is responsible for its fiscal policy: it is in line with the Treaty, it is in line with what we decided when setting up the euro area, and it is something which is of course fully in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and the appropriate rules that we considered part of the overall framework of EMU – Economic and Monetary Union. There are three words: “Union” speaks for itself, as does “Monetary”, and “Economic” refers particularly to the Stability and Growth Pact. There are two potential questions: one is: will the Treasuries issue joint bonds where they would be associated joint and severally or something like that. You mention the proposal of Mr Tremonti. It seems to me that it is something like that he might have had in mind. And then there is another issue which is whether it would be the Commission itself or the EU itself. I responded to the first concept namely that it is better that each Treasury is responsible for its own issuance. I did not have in mind the second one. It seems to me that you would have to ask governments the question. The governments are not in favour, and the Council is not in favour, to my knowledge up to now. Again, this is a decision to be taken by governments first. Second, in the present framework I guess that the reasoning of the European executive branches – I take the Council as a college – would be that they have the European Investment Bank (EIB), which has its own capacity to finance the European economy, which has its own capacity to borrow on its own signature, which is a European signature, and that they probably consider that the instruments exist already. At this stage, I have no position of the Governing Council. I think one should not respond to such questions in general, because there are very important differences among market-places and among economies. I am speaking of the European Union as a whole, not only of the euro area. There are also big differences from bank to bank, so you cannot really give an across-the-board response to such questions. I see a “menu of options”: after the recapitalisations, after the guarantees, we now see the need in some circumstances for additional possible tools, namely the possibility of purchasing, or putting aside, toxic or vulnerable assets, and also this idea of having a “tail risk” guarantee for assets that would remain on the balance sheets of various banks. These are the ideas that have been floated. What I would say at this stage would be whatever you do, you have to fully respect the level playing-field of the European single market, of the single market for financial services and you have to be sure there is an appropriate pricing of whatever you do, as appropriate pricing is part of the level playing-field. This was the way it was addressed for the recapitalisations to avoid abnormal competition and abnormal situations. In case you are in a full individual rescue operation, you have also to respect very simply the European rules, for which the Commission is responsible. And second question is: Are you seeing any signs that the government stimulus packages are actually working and does this diminish the need for monetary policy action? Again, what you are asking for is the end of the current non-standard mode of, I would say, both central banks and governments. We have to consider that one of the main adverse factors that we have to cope with is the absence of confidence. It is because there is a general absence of sufficient confidence that we have to cope with this exceptional difficulty. Part of the confidence that we have to recreate depends on the sentiment that, in the medium to long term we will come back to a sustainable pace of policies. And I would say that we are reflecting on when we will see the end of our present non-standard actions. But at this stage I would also say that we consider such actions to be needed. And we will continue to do that for as long as this is necessary. But we know, of course, that we will have to return to a normal mode and the same holds true for the governments. This is what I said on behalf of the Governing Council a moment ago, when I addressed the fiscal policies. As regards your second question we will see how things proceed. These were very important decisions that were taken by a large number of governments. Let me mention, en passant, that all governments do not have the same room for manoeuvre and that, in certain cases where you embark on exceptional action of that kind, but destroy confidence in the sustainability of your own position, you will not gain anything. But I trust really that what has been decided already is very substantial, and we will see how it is incorporated in the real economy. Equally substantial is the explicit expansionary effect that is embedded in the significant decline in the prices of oil and commodities. And that is the reason why I consider it to be so important that these energy prices remain at low levels and do not pick up again, because their present level is part of the overall stabilisation of the global economy. What we had decided, you might remember, was to broaden our corridor in order to help, on the basis of the analysis made, revive the money market. The argument was that if you are too forthcoming in remunerating the commercial banks, they will continue not to borrow and lend among themselves, but instead take the extra liquidity and place it in the deposit facility. So, we are at a stage where we see whether we are reviving the money market. That is the way we see it. We did not change anything, but lower the deposit facility rate, because we enlarged the corridor. And what happens is that we see that the EONIA has a tendency to hover over the deposit rate, wherever it may be. We will continue to look at this. We have a date at our next decision-making meeting to see exactly what has happened and to draw appropriate conclusions from our decision to enlarge the corridor. At the moment I am speaking, I would say that we have seen an improvement that is modest, but certainly an improvement, which we can measure – all other things being equal – when we look, for instance, at the level of the outstanding deposits we hold, which is a little bit lower, all things being equal, than the level we would have had if we had not enlarged the corridor. But I acknowledge that it is something which has remained modest. I said absolutely nothing on the size of the future moves. We will do whatever is necessary taking into account facts, figures and our strategy. The second question, you say you do not exclude additional non-standard measures, by which most people would understand to mean outright purchases of government bonds or corporate bonds or commercial paper. Could you maybe give us some idea about the principles on which the ECB might go about such measures? I mean, for instance, would you continue to work with banks or is it possible you might seek to bypass the banking system and go directly to help corporates facing credit problems? Will the principle of no bail-outs within Europe apply, continue to apply? And the third very general but important question: Mr Trichet, when you look at the world, do you think policy-makers around the globe have done enough to bring this global crisis under control and to restore that confidence that you think is so important? As for the size, I already responded. On today’s meeting, I will only say that it was a meeting as usual where we looked in-depth at all situations and we exchanged all possible views. It was certainly a very deep and profound meditation and discussion. We were unanimous in taking our decision, which does not mean that we all have the same view. We exchange very different viewpoints amongst us. On the non-standard action, I would say we are already in a non-standard period and I will go into the details of the non-standard action when we decide. At this stage, I do not want to comment on or qualify what we could do or not do. What is sure is that we have to do something which would take into account the fact that we are very open and forthcoming as regards the eligibility of our collateral. This is part of our framework and we have to take that into account. It is not necessarily part of the framework of other central banks. We have to look, of course, at our own risks, taking into account that one characteristic of the set of non-standard decisions we took already was that it increased our own credit risk–taking. As regards your last question, I would say we are in exceptional circumstances. That is absolutely clear. You know that we were one of the institutions, which was lucid in diagnosing even as soon as 9 August 2007 that something was happening which was exceptional, which was very abnormal, in terms of financial sphere’s behaviour. We have to cope with this exceptional intensification of the crisis which came in September 2008 At the moment I am speaking it seems to me that authorities, whether central banks or governments, have really taken decisions that are until now commensurate with the exceptional circumstances in which they were put very sharply, very abruptly, in mid–September. I have only to say that they have all, in my opinion, to remain alert because, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, uncertainty remains of the essence: we are very much in a “Knightian” universe. We do not know what will be or is the law of probability of future events. So we have to be prepared for everything. And this is certainly the best way to sum up your pertinent question. Let us be alert. We are in an uncertain universe but, looking at what has been decided, I will not diagnose that either central banks or governments or authorities in general have been slow or shy or timid in their own reactions. Now, the private sector is decisive. It is the private sector which is reducing orders. It is the private sector which is reducing the pace of discretionary spending. It is the households that are saving more than we would suggest, particularly in a number of countries where savings are already very high. It is the corporate businesses that decide that they would diminish their investment programmes and so forth. So, what we have to do - and in that domain we have still a lot to do - would be to convince them that there are also two-way risks. There was a risk in being overconfident and that has proved to be a major risk that some of them were taking. But there is equally a risk of being over-pessimistic and of missing the moment when we will have the recovery, which will happen of course. I think the main issue at stake is how to re-establish an appropriate level of confidence on a medium-term basis in the private sector, among all decision-makers of the private sector. But it seems to me that one element of confidence they could have, would be to see precisely the rapidity and the boldness of the reaction that has taken place until now. But that being said let us not forget our permanent message in the ECB: if you want to consolidate confidence, be sure that what you do is credible as regards its sustainability in the medium-to-long run. Otherwise, you do not consolidate confidence. And, secondly, you also mentioned protectionism as a risk in your speech – twice actually, I think. What exactly are you referring to, and does it have any reference to the US stimulus package and what has happened in relation to letters between the Commission and the US? First of all, as soon as possible means fixing, together with the Commission the appropriate medium-term target and a credible pace for reaching the medium-term target in order to restore confidence and to consolidate confidence. That is essential, particularly for countries which will have a large increase in their annual deficit. The stability and growth pact is there, it tells you what you have to do in such circumstances. We rely upon the alertness of the Commission and the determination of the governments in question to fully understand that they themselves must be credible in terms of this medium-term objective to get back to a normal situation in order to help households and economic agents to have a high level of confidence. Protectionism is something which is considered by the Governing Council to be a major threat. We see tendencies to embark upon extensive protectionism, and that is something which is exactly the opposite of what should be done in the present circumstances, and there is a very large consensus, certainly at the level of economists, and also of central banks, as well as governments, that it would be a great mistake to engage in this kind of nationalistic reaction that exacted a very high price in the previous century. We also see a tendency towards financial protectionism – spontaneous or organised financial protectionism – or financial mercantilism, and that is also something that we consider to be very unfavourable. And it is unfavourable at a global level. It is unfavourable at the level of Europe, and it would certainly be unfavourable if it were to manifest itself at the level of the euro area. I have already responded to that question. First of all, we have to draw a lot of lessons, as one of the important institutions in the world in terms of preventing the situation which we find ourselves in, and this is being done in particular by the Financial Stability Forum in which we very actively participate, and also through various “G” groups at various levels, and we also participate in the Basel Committee. We know what the main avenues are where we have a large consensus of authorities and, fortunately, of market participants and private sector entities. We must also consider it extremely important to have effective peer surveillance and an effective international financial institutions’ surveillance of the global imbalances. And we know that what we are observing today is not exclusively, but in many respects, a price to be paid because we have let global imbalances grow for too long, and I don’t exclude any country or any economy from this. I think we all have to accept that we have responsibilities. As regards the monetary policy side, central banks have a position that is really unique: first, they are independent, second, they have no vested interests, and third, they are called upon to deliver stability in the medium and long run. They are not short-termists by definition. They have a medium and long-term vision. And it seems to me that in a world which has been marked by extreme volatility, extreme short-termism and extreme absence of consideration for long-term values, such as long-term price stability and financial stability. We have an important role to play – perhaps a more important role to play after this experience than was the case before, as an anchor of stability. But we have said that since this institution was set up, and we try to be faithful to what we are called upon to do, in all circumstances, whether easy circumstances – but we have not had many easy periods, obviously – or difficult circumstances, and this is a very difficult period. "
15/01/2009,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our first press conference of 2009. Let me therefore wish you all a very Happy New Year. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Slovakia as the 16th country to adopt the euro as its currency. Accordingly, Mr Šramko, the Governor of Národná banka Slovenska, became a member of the Governing Council on 1 January 2009. Following the adoption of the euro by Slovakia there are now 329 million citizens using the euro as their currency. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by a further 50 basis points, bringing the total reduction since 8 October 2008 to 225 basis points. Today’s decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish, owing in particular to the further weakening in the economic outlook. Looking forward, we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. After today’s decision we consider risks to price stability over the medium term to be broadly balanced. This takes into account the latest economic data releases and survey information, which add clear further evidence to the assessment that the euro area is experiencing a significant slowdown, largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil. Both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period. Monetary expansion is moderating further, supporting the assessment that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing. All in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. This supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Since September 2008 the financial market turmoil has intensified and broadened. Tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector into the real economy. As a result, economic activity throughout the world, including in the euro area, has weakened further. In particular, foreign demand for euro area exports has declined, and euro area domestic activity has contracted in the face of weaker demand prospects and tighter financing conditions. The survey data and monthly indicators for November and December that have become available since our last meeting clearly point to a further weakening of economic activity around the turn of the year, indicating the materialisation of previously identified downside risks to activity. Looking further ahead, on the basis of our current analysis and assessment, we continue to see global economic weakness and very sluggish domestic demand persisting in the coming quarters as the impact of the financial tensions on activity continues. At the same time, we expect the fall in commodity prices to support real disposable income in the period ahead. Furthermore, the euro area should over time reap the full benefit from the effects of policy measures announced over recent weeks In the view of the Governing Council, this outlook for the economy remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty. Overall, risks to economic growth remain clearly on the downside. They relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as to concerns about the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. It is crucial that all parties concerned make their contribution to lay sound foundations for a sustainable recovery. For this to materialise as early as possible, it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making, pursuing a stability-oriented and sustainable approach. This is the best way to preserve and enhance confidence. The significant measures being implemented by governments to deal with the financial turmoil should help to ensure trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has declined substantially since the middle of 2008, when it peaked at 4.0%. HICP inflation was 1.6% in December, after 2.1% in November. As we have emphasised on previous occasions, the significant decline in headline inflation in the second half of 2008 reflects mainly the sharp falls in global commodity prices over the past few months. Looking forward, lower commodity prices and weakening demand confirm that inflationary pressures in the euro area are diminishing. Owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices, headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months, possibly reaching very low levels at mid-year. However, also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments, inflation rates are expected to increase again in the second half of the year. Hence it is likely that HICP inflation rates will fluctuate sharply during 2009. Such short-term volatility is, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking over the policy-relevant, medium-term horizon, annual HICP inflation is expected to be in line with price stability. This assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. Risks to price stability over the medium term are broadly balanced. Unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation, while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed. It is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest evidence confirms a moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area. Monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing. In analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since mid-September has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly. Recent money and credit data indicate that this has already had a substantial impact on the behaviour of market participants. Both the broad aggregate M3 and, in particular, the components of M3 that are most closely related to the ongoing financial tensions – such as holdings of money market funds – have shown high month-to-month volatility of late. Overall, however, looking to the extent possible through this volatility, the rate of broad money growth continues to moderate in line with the trend established over the past 18 months, with the intensification of financial tensions since September leading to significant substitution among the components of M3, rather than, at least so far, sharp changes in the trend of M3 itself. Turning to the evolution of bank loans, the tightening of financing conditions resulting from the intensification of the financial tensions has contributed to a slowdown in the flow of monetary financial institution (MFI) loans to the non-financial private sector in recent months. More data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement about the severity and scope of credit constraints and their possible implications for economic activity. To sum up, we decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by a further 50 basis points, bringing the total reduction since 8 October 2008 to 225 basis points. Today’s decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish, owing in particular to the further weakening in the economic outlook. The Governing Council recalls its operational decision, taken on 18 December 2008, to widen again the corridor formed by the rates on the Eurosystem’s standing facilities as of 21 January 2009. Looking forward, we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. After today’s decision we consider risks to price stability over the medium-term to be broadly balanced. This takes into account the latest economic data releases and survey information, which add clear further evidence to the assessment that the euro area is experiencing a significant slowdown, largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil. Both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms this view. Monetary expansion is moderating further, supporting the assessment that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing. All in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. This supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the European Council’s reconfirmation of its full commitment to sustainable public finances. In this respect, the current economic situation calls for particular prudence with regard to the adoption of extensive fiscal stimulus measures, taking into account the particular fiscal situation in each country. The operation of automatic stabilisers will provide a relatively large and powerful fiscal impulse to the weakening economy, in addition to already announced expansionary fiscal policy measures and the government support for the banking sector. Taken together, the additional measures decided so far put a considerable burden on public finances in a large number of euro area countries. If not reversed in due time, this will negatively affect in particular the younger and future generations. It is therefore essential to return to a credible commitment to medium-term budgetary objectives as soon as possible. The significant fiscal loosening and the implied increase in government debt should in any case not risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances, thereby detracting from the effectiveness of a fiscal stimulus. Turning to structural policies, the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook imply the need to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of the euro area economy. Product market reforms should foster competition and speed up effective restructuring. Labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions. The current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * First, it is important to note that we were unanimous in deciding today to diminish rates by 50 basis points. Why? As I have already said, we were taking into account a significant further alleviation of inflationary risks, owing in particular, but not exclusively, to the slowdown of the global and European economies. Unfortunately, this slowdown has been documented and substantiated since the last meeting of the Governing Council. We were anticipating a further significant slowdown compared with our previous Eurosystem staff projections. So our decision comprises both our observation of what has already happened based on the new information which has become available since our last decision-making meeting and the sentiment of the Governing Council that we have to anticipate further slowdown and therefore the further alleviation of the inflationary risk. With regard to the previous interest rate cuts, you remember that I said that we would look very carefully at the transmission of the previous decisions, in particular, the decrease by 75 basis points of our main policy rate at our last meeting. I have to say that we have observed that the short-term market rates have transmitted quite significantly our previous decision, particularly when you look at the three-month EURIBOR rate, which has shown a substantial diminishing. Although this occurred gradually, week by week and day by day, we were nevertheless able to observe that it was taking place. That does not mean to say, of course, that we do not still have abnormal spreads in the financial markets. However, taking into account the short-term rates that we are directly influencing, we can observe a clear diminishing in line with the decision that we took in December. As I have already said it is not the intention of the Governing Council to find itself in a liquidity trap. I will not give you and nor do you expect me to give you a figure, but it is our intention not to find ourselves in a position that would constitute a liquidity trap. In our opinion, this decrease of 50 basis points not only takes into account hard data to date, but also takes into account a continued slowdown of the economy and further alleviation of inflationary expectations. Based on this, we believe that medium-term inflation is broadly balanced and in line with our definition of price stability. Let me add that we consider that our next important meeting for monetary policy will be the Governing Council meeting in March, when we will have substantial new information at our disposal and our new projections. Given that our decision-making meeting in February is only three weeks away, we do not deem it an important meeting for policy-making. The next important meeting will be in March. Again, we believe that we have largely anticipated today what is likely to be observed. In our view it was necessary to take into account this further slowdown. That said, you know our motto: “we are never pre-committed!” Second, since events are moving very quickly in terms of assessing what kind of new regulatory framework will be necessary for the banking system, with the G20 meeting in London in April and so forth, what is the Governing Council’s stand regarding the need for a more global approach to regulation, possibly including a college of supervisors or something more, as well as the possibility of a European banking supervisor, perhaps even based right next door to the ECB? Our definition of price stability is below, but close to 2%. But I add immediately in the medium term, in the policy relevant horizon. In the past, we have observed humps in headline inflation that were particularly spectacular. Of course, headline inflation depends enormously on oil and commodity prices. On the basis of the present future market indications, there will be an exceptionally low level of headline inflation this year, particularly at mid-year. I do not want to give a figure at this stage, but I think that it will be very low and that it will pick up afterwards, because this is the arithmetic influence of base effects, of the previous picking-up and slowing-down of oil and commodity prices. Therefore, let’s not focus on this short-term volatility: the needle in our compass is medium-term inflation, in line with our definition of price stability. We believe that today’s decision is the right decision to ensure that we deliver inflation in the medium term in line with our definition of price stability, which is not simply 2%, but “below, but close to 2%”, meaning that “close to 2%” is part of our definition of price stability. In terms of anchoring inflation expectations, which is very important from both perspectives, it is important to avoid expectations of very high inflation – which we have done as responsibly as possible – and it is also important that inflation be anchored close to 2% – as it has been since the start of the euro – in order to avoid the reverse counterproductive effects. In answer to your second question, we are actively participating, through all kinds of channels, in the present discussion at the global level on the many lessons to be drawn from what we are experiencing now. Market economies need to be much more resilient and the current situation calls for bold decisions in many domains. We will continue to be as active as possible in the various international groupings, both informal and formal. As regards a global approach to banking regulation, we are certainly in favour of as close as possible cooperation between banking surveillance authorities at the global level. This is a process that is ongoing and the concept of a college of supervisors would play a crucial part in this close cooperation. As regards the European framework, I will only say at this stage that the Governing Council has not taken a definitive position on this and that it is something that it will continue to discuss. I can mention that Article 105(6) of the Treaty itself explicitly mentions the possibility for executive branches to decide to confer upon the ECB additional responsibilities in the domain of banking surveillance – not insurance surveillance, but banking surveillance. This is something that is being examined by the European Parliament, as you will have gathered from its last plenary session in Brussels. I know that the de Larosière Commission might also examine the issue. I will not say anything else at this stage. These are suggestions and the Governing Council has no position as yet. No. The Governing Council has observed that there was a further alleviation of the inflationary risk. And secondly, I would like to ask about your reaction to the move by the Fed and the Bank of Japan. The Fed cut the rate to almost zero in December and the BoJ also cut the rate to 0.1. Do you see any possibility – the slightest possibility – that the ECB might need to follow suit in the future? I placed great emphasis in December, on behalf of the Governing Council, on the fact that we had decided to decrease rates by 175 basis points in a very short time and you will have noted today that I said that in the space of three months we had decreased rates by 225 basis points. I said last time that we would look very carefully at the transmission of this decision in the real economy. I have explained that today’s decision was made taking into account developments since our last decision-making meeting and also anticipated what we expect to be the confirmation of a very significant alleviation of inflationary risks associated with a very significant slowing down of the economy. So, these are our reasons; we are anticipating what we expect to be confirmed, namely a significant further slowing down of the economy. I have already said that the next important meeting is in March and not in February. As regards the decisions that are taken by the Fed and the BoJ, they are of course their own decisions and their own responsibility. As far as we are concerned, taking into account our own economic and financial environment, we are very keen to avoid ending up in a situation that, for us, would not be appropriate, namely a liquidity trap. Well, when we are ready, we will say so. The De Larosière Commission is under quite tight time constraints; that is absolutely right. And it is not our intention to waste time. We will discuss the matter as expeditiously and professionally as possible. Again we are not speaking of something which is abstract and up in the air. There is an article in the Treaty – Article 105.6 – that says explicitly that, following agreement by the various executive branches, we could be given further responsibility. Secondly, to give you another chance, you did not answer the question about whether there was any discussion or whether there were any voices that proposed a smaller or no change in the interest rates, or even a larger cut than the 50 basis points. Perhaps you could tell us. And thirdly, you obviously noticed the downgrading of Greek debt yesterday. Is the eurozone at risk from a default from one of its governments? On the handling of the money market, you know that our main aim is to revive the money market, to help it to function as well as possible. It was what has inspired practically all of our decisions – including bold decisions – since the very beginning of the financial turmoil. When I look at the policy rate on the one hand and the three-month money market on the other hand, which is important for a large number of borrowers, I have already said that we were quite impressed by the fact that the transmission of our own decisions has taken place quite visibly. We will continue to monitor very short-term rates closely. I will not elaborate more on that. You remember that we recently decided to re-widen our corridor. The main aim of this re-widening of the corridor is to push the banks as much as possible into returning to their own intrabank transactions. This is something that we will follow very carefully by monitoring the volume of intrabank transactions. On the second question, I said that we were unanimous in taking that decision. We considered that a reduction in rates was, in any event, necessary taking into account the alleviation of inflationary pressure. The question was rather whether we should do it now or a little later. We decided, unanimously, to do it now, as I have said, with the idea that we will have a new rendezvous in March. That said, as you know, and as we show at each of our meetings, we are never pre-committed. On your last point, I would totally exclude any kind of hypothesis such as the one you suggest. We see market spreads. I am not too surprised to see that there are tensions in this particular segment of the market because we have tensions in all markets. This is part of the overall financial turbulence that we have to cope with. I would only add that what we observe gives us an additional good reason to say: let’s use all the room for manoeuvre that is offered in the Stability and Growth Pact – but only the room for manoeuvre that is in the Pact. And so the fact that the Governing Council of the ECB always calls on Member States to stick to the revised Pact is fully backed not only by the legal consideration that the Pact is the uniting framework on which the executive branches were unanimous, but also by financial consideration and by economic consideration and, particularly, the Ricardian effect that I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council in this Introductory Statement, namely the fact that confidence in the sustainability – the long-term sustainability – of the fiscal position is very important for the economy – for the confidence of economic agents, whether households or corporate. First of all, if I take the increase of our balance sheet, if all is taken into account, including the collateral which is the counterpart of the dollar liquidity supply that we are engaging in, I would say that our balance sheet has doubled in comparison with July 2007, that is, just before the turmoil. So it is something which is very substantial, as you have said yourself, and it is something which is associated with the fact that, since the beginning of the turbulence, we have had a very high level of openness as regards collateral eligibility. This was a major difference from some other central banks. It is also closely associated with the liquidity-providing that we do on an unlimited basis at fixed rates now for all maturities. It is certainly, in our view, necessary to permanently reflect on the exit strategy – and I trust that all central banks in the world are reflecting on exit strategies – but it is not our present vision that it is time to embark on an exit strategy, I would not say that at all. The time will come when we will observe that we are back to a much more normal situation. But this is not yet what we are observing today. So we will continue to be as pragmatic, effective and efficient as possible in this domain. I stress the pragmatism, because what we have done on several occasions was very bold, very pragmatic and entirely designed to fit the problems and difficulties that the euro area had. For the future, I would say that we will continue to act in exactly the same spirit. Secondly, overnight deposits at the ECB’s window are high and had been rising in recent days, and ECB policy-makers before the holiday break mentioned that a euro zone clearing house for interbank lending was an idea worth considering – is it still? And finally, you just mentioned the easing in three-month EURIBOR rates as evidence of a functioning monetary policy transmission mechanism; all else being equal, would that make the Governing Council more or less likely to consider lowering the rate? We are, after today’s decision, at 2%. We did not say that it is the limit and that we will not move anymore. We did not say that. We said – and it seems to me that it is a very important observation – that we are anticipating bad news from the real economy and a further alleviation of inflationary risks. If you look at the past, 2% is the lowest level of interest rates we have ever decided since the setting-up of the euro. It is something like the lowest level ever decided or even lower than the lowest level ever decided by the founding fathers’ institutions, that is, the central banks of Europe that created the euro and the ECB. So it is, in historical terms, a very low level. But again, I don’t say that it is the lowest point that is in the view of the Governing Council the appropriate one. I said that we will have a new meeting in March, and we will see in March what we will do. We have a needle in our compass which is very important because, as I have said on many occasions, it is the only one: less than 2%, close to 2% in the medium term. We will certainly look when we meet in March to see whether the needle in the compass continues to be in the appropriate position. We will take into account all elements, the inflationary risks, the expectations. I have to say that, so far, I am happy that we have a definition of price stability which is precise, which is an arithmetic definition, because it helps to anchor inflationary expectations, avoiding both that they go up and that they go down. When I compare our inflationary expectations with those observed in a number of other economies, I see that we are helped by our solid, clear definition of price stability. I would not make any close link between what we have observed in the three-month money market EURIBOR and the decision we took. It is true that we said that we would look very carefully at that, and the fact is that the three-month money market has correctly transferred the decrease in rates that we decided on in our last decision-making meeting. But the reasons why we decreased rates today are entirely those I have already mentioned. At this stage we have no particular sentiment, we are open to anything, but at this stage we have absolutely no decision as regards an orientation. We will see exactly what the best solution would be. Until now our orientation has been - with all that we are doing with our abundant supply of liquidity and with all the efforts that are made by governments to help banks, all actions which are very important to help the financial sphere - that we should normally see the spontaneous progressive revival of the money market. But we are pragmatic. And can you just be absolutely clear for us: you mentioned that some people today in the meeting discussed maybe waiting a bit before cutting rates. So did some people argue to keep rates on hold? And finally a fairly simple question, you said that there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding it, but at the present moment how long do you think the recession in Europe will last, and can you give us a rough time frame of when you think the bottom of the cycle will be? First of all as regards the decision, we were unanimous to decide to decrease rates by 50 basis points. As regards the projections, I would say that the sentiment of the Governing Council is that we will have a level of growth which will be significantly lower than our last staff projections. The next meeting with the new staff projections will be, as I already said, in March. We did not discuss a precise figure but we expect that whatever will come from the various institutions before the March meeting will confirm what we trust, namely that global growth and European growth would be lower than has been previously projected. That was the answer to two of your questions. You had a third one? I said that there was unanimity to decrease the rates by 50 basis points today. Certainly not, that being said short-term rates do not mean only EONIA. As you might have seen, we have a view of looking at what happens in this shorter part of the very short yield curve. Everybody can see what we have been doing – it’s very open and we have a policy rate which is obvious and clear. We are presently refinancing at that fixed rate on a one-week, one-month, three-month, six-month basis. So the policy rate is crystal clear and what we are doing is that we are trying to help revive the money market spontaneously. And this calls for appropriate handling. I mean it’s a matter of doing exactly what we trust would be the best to help revive that market, but our policy rates are crystal clear. The second question is, in December you mentioned that the so-called quantitative easing, including the outright purchases of the assets from the banks, is a possibility. In today’s discussion did you discuss anything about embarking on this approach? And the third and final question relates to the tenth anniversary of the euro currency. Congratulations on this! I would like to ask what have been the achievements in the remaining subjects. As other colleagues pointed out, there is a so-called north-south gap problem. We haven’t seen the UK or the Nordics joining the common currency, so how do you summarise the achievements and the remaining subjects, for example the coming ten years? Your question is a very wide one, which would call for a long exposition. But let’s start with the first question. We do what we have to do at any time; we consider that it is our duty and our responsibility to be, if I may say so, neither behind the curve nor ahead of the curve, but to do at any given time exactly what we judge appropriate. If I look at the anchoring of inflation expectations that we obtain ourselves and compare them with what is observed in comparable economies, I think that we are doing our job pretty correctly. So we follow the approach that each time we meet we try to do exactly what is appropriate to allow us to deliver price stability in line with our definition of below 2% but close to 2% at any time in the medium term. As regards the quantitative aspect I already said that we had a balance sheet that had doubled since the start of the turbulences in August 2007. It is something which, in terms of risk-taking by this institution, is extremely significant, extremely substantial. It is our function of risk-taker in an environment where we are under a considerable new set of constraints in the economy and in the finance associated with the financial turbulences which started in 2007 and increased considerably in mid-September last year. I always said that we are very pragmatic. We proved that we were pragmatic – nobody could have expected that our balance sheet would double since July 2007 – and I exclude nothing ex ante. We look at what we could do or should do, taking everything into account. As for the tenth anniversary: we started with 11 countries in an environment which was quite sceptical as regards our capacity to run a new currency from scratch, to run a new institution from scratch, the Eurosystem, the ECB, to have an appropriate decision-making process with the combination of the Executive Board and the Governing Council. And now, ten years later I can tell you that we have a single currency which is credible; I can say that in Berlin as well as in other capitals. We promised you that you would have a currency that would be credible and inspire confidence. And nobody is challenging that. So, this is something that I humbly present you as a success. Again we started with 11 countries and we are now 16 countries. Who would have expected that ten years after the creation of the euro we would be 16? And now we have a lot of challenges. I say that of course this might be time for a celebration and congratulations. But I also said in the plenary session of the European Parliament last Tuesday that it is no time for complacency – it’s never time for complacency - but particularly not in the present universe of constraints and threats that we have. So we will continue to be up to the challenges. And we have not only all the challenges of the Federal Reserve, or the Bank of England, or the Bank of Japan and also other sister institutions, but we have also the challenges that we have ourselves, namely that we are transforming our own economy structurally by our own making, by the very existence of the single currency, and that is not simplifying our own decision-making process, because we cannot rely on an extrapolation of past observations for the future. We have to make up our mind on what the future will really be, taking into account the important structural transformation of the European economy. And we have enlargement, which is a historical endeavour that calls for a very high level of professionalism to be sure that everything goes correctly. This is the reason why complacency is certainly not the appropriate mindset in the present circumstances. No, I see the global economy and the European economy very much in sync. So I would confirm that, in comparison with 2009, we certainly see quite a slowdown vis-à-vis our previous projections. I would also say, as I said with regard to the global economy at the press briefing following the Global Economy Meeting in Basel, that I see 2010 as the year of recovery and pick-up. I make no distinction on the profile of growth between the global economy and our own economy, which is itself, of course, a significant part of the global economy. We will have a considerable slowdown in 2009 and a pick-up in 2010. I have already said what I had to say. I said that the next important meeting would, in my opinion, be in March, even if we are not pre-committed – I insist on that because it is our own fundamental framework – but we will see what we have to do: it will depend entirely on the needle in our compass: delivering price stability in the medium term, in line with our definition: “below 2 %, but close to 2%”. I am not saying that 2% was considered ex-ante by the Governing Council as a low level which could not be displaced. If this were the case, I would tell you that we are at 2% and now we consider that we will stay at 2% and will wait for the possible future increase. This is not what I say. At the same time I told you that we will not fall into what we consider to be a possible liquidity trap, which is something that we would deem dangerous for our own economy, taking into account our own circumstances, and that we also have other means, other ways, if necessary, of embarking on “non-standard action”. It is Keynesian if you wish, but the problem is that experience has demonstrated that once you were there it was very difficult to get out. A very low interest rate. "
