08/12/2011,Draghi,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to lower the  key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, following the 25 basis point decrease on 3 November 2011. Inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. The intensified financial market tensions are continuing to dampen economic activity in the euro area and the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. In such an environment, cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should remain modest over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. Overall, it is essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. In its continued efforts to support the liquidity situation of euro area banks, and following the coordinated central bank action on 30 November 2011 to provide liquidity to the global financial system, the Governing Council today also decided to adopt further non-standard measures. These measures should ensure enhanced access of the banking sector to liquidity and facilitate the functioning of the euro area money market. They are expected to support the provision of credit to households and non-financial corporations. In this context, the Governing Council decided: First, to conduct two longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) with a maturity of 36 months and the option of early repayment after one year. The operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rate in these operations will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations over the life of the respective operation. Interest will be paid when the respective operation matures. The first operation will be allotted on 21 December 2011 and will replace the 12-month LTRO announced on 6 October 2011. Second, to increase collateral availability by reducing the rating threshold for certain asset-backed securities (ABS). In addition to the ABS that are already eligible for Eurosystem operations, ABS having a second best rating of at least “single A” in the Eurosystem harmonised credit scale at issuance, and at all times subsequently, and the underlying assets of which comprise residential mortgages and loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, will be eligible for use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. Moreover, national central banks will be allowed, as a temporary solution, to accept as collateral additional performing credit claims (namely bank loans) that satisfy specific eligibility criteria. The responsibility entailed in the acceptance of such credit claims will be borne by the national central bank authorising their use. These measures will take effect as soon as the relevant legal acts have been published. Third, to reduce the reserve ratio, which is currently 2%, to 1%. This will free up collateral and support money market activity. As a consequence of the full allotment policy applied in the ECB’s main refinancing operations and the way banks are using this option, the system of reserve requirements is not needed to the same extent as under normal circumstances to steer money market conditions. This measure will take effect as of the maintenance period starting on 18 January 2012. Fourth, to discontinue for the time being, as of the maintenance period starting on 14 December 2011, the fine-tuning operations carried out on the last day of each maintenance period. This is a technical measure to support money market activity. A detailed press release will be published at 3.30 p.m. today on the ECB’s website. As stated on previous occasions, all the non-standard monetary policy measures are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area grew by 0.2% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2011, unchanged from the previous quarter. Evidence from survey data points to weaker economic activity in the fourth quarter of this year. A number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area. They include a moderation in the pace of global demand growth and unfavourable effects on overall financing conditions and on confidence resulting from ongoing tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors. At the same time, we expect euro area economic activity to recover, albeit very gradually, in the course of next year, supported by resilient global demand, very low short-term interest rates and all the measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% in 2011, between -0.4% and 1.0% in 2012 and between 0.3% and 2.3% in 2013. Compared with the September 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, there is a narrowing of the range of the real GDP growth projection for 2011 and a significant downward revision of the range for 2012. These revisions mainly reflect the impact on domestic demand of weaker confidence and worsening financing conditions, stemming from the heightened uncertainty related to the sovereign debt crisis, as well as downward revisions of foreign demand. In the Governing Council’s assessment, substantial downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area exist in an environment of high uncertainty. Downside risks notably relate to a further intensification of the tensions in euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to the global economy, which may be weaker than expected, as well as to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 3.0% in November, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from the two previous months. Inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of last year, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. Looking ahead, they are likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. This pattern reflects the expectation that, in an environment of weaker growth in the euro area and globally, underlying cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should also remain modest. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.6% and 2.8% for 2011, between 1.5% and 2.5% for 2012 and between 0.8% and 2.2% for 2013. Compared with the September 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projection ranges for 2011 and 2012 have been revised slightly upwards. This results from the upward impact of higher oil prices in euro terms, as well as a higher contribution from indirect taxes. The upward impact of these factors is expected to more than compensate the downward adjustments to profit margins and wage growth that are related to the downward revision of activity. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. On the upside, the main risks relate to further increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 2.6% in October 2011, after 3.0% in September. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, increased to 3.0% in October, compared with 2.7% in September. As in the previous two months, the monetary data for October reflect the heightened uncertainty in financial markets. On the counterpart side, the annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, remained broadly unchanged in October, at 2.3% and 2.5% respectively. The unadjusted growth rates were lower, owing to substantial securitisation activities in October. Overall, the figures on lending do not suggest that the heightened financial market tensions have significantly affected the supply of credit in the period to October. However, given that credit supply effects can manifest themselves with lags, close scrutiny of credit developments is warranted in the period ahead. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective and looking through short-term volatility, overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. The soundness of bank balance sheets will be a key factor in reducing potential negative feedback loop effects related to tensions in financial markets, thereby facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy over time. The agreement of the European Council of 26 October to proceed with the increase in the capital position of banks to 9% of core Tier 1 by the end of June 2012 should improve the euro area banking sector’s resilience over the medium term. In this respect, it is essential that national supervisors ensure that the implementation of banks’ recapitalisation plans does not result in developments that are detrimental to the financing of economic activity in the euro area. To sum up, inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. Intensified financial market tensions are continuing to dampen economic activity in the euro area and the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. In such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should remain modest over the policy-relevant horizon. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture, with the underlying pace of monetary expansion remaining moderate. Turning to fiscal policies, all euro area governments urgently need to do their utmost to support fiscal sustainability in the euro area as a whole. A new fiscal compact, comprising a fundamental restatement of the fiscal rules together with the fiscal commitments that euro area governments have made, is the most important precondition for restoring the normal functioning of financial markets. Policy-makers need to correct excessive deficits and move to balanced budgets in the coming years by specifying and implementing the necessary adjustment measures. This will support public confidence in the soundness of policy actions and thus strengthen overall economic sentiment. To accompany fiscal consolidation, the Governing Council has repeatedly called for bold and ambitious structural reforms. Going hand in hand, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms would strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. Key reforms should be immediately carried out to help the euro area countries to improve competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. Labour market reforms should focus on removing rigidities and enhancing wage flexibility. Product market reforms should focus on fully opening up markets to increased competition. My second question is on rates. Was your decision today unanimous? And did you consider cutting more? Is there more room, given the downside risks to the economy? The answer to the first question is “no”. The answer to the second question is “no”. And the answer to the third question is “we never pre-commit”. So, it is two “noes” and one “never pre-commit”. By the way, I was kind of surprised by the implicit meaning that was given by not all of the press, but some, to that “other elements will follow”. Let me step back and talk about the compact. A compact is an agreement, fundamentally. One of my collaborators said that compact could also be read as “community pact”, but that was not meant to be my initial suggestion. A compact could be viewed as a three-pillar-concept: The first pillar is national economic policies geared to stability, growth and job creation – fiscal stability, growth and competitiveness, and therefore job creation. The second pillar is rules at EU level, or in any event rules, fiscal rules, enshrined in primary legislation. These rules would contain limits to structural deficits and to debt. These rules would be automatic and they would in a sense constrain ex ante, because they are in the primary legislation, budgets that are legislated in the secondary legislation. So, one would certainly have ex post controls; they are important, they are essential, but an ex ante constraint of an automatic nature would certainly increase the credibility of this re-design of the EU or the fiscal compact that is now in these very hours under discussion by the leaders. The third leg of this concept would be a stabilisation mechanism. I always find it somewhat puzzling that this is actually where most of the attention is focused when we know that the lack of credibility or the lack of confidence stems from the other two, from the lack of the other two pillars originally. My preference in respect of this stability mechanism – but this is my preference – is for the EFSF, the EFSF first, and the ESM later, to be fully equipped and operational, and made operational as soon as possible. So, sooner rather than later. I think the developments in Italy have been very encouraging. It is a budget which is certainly important and would certainly strengthen confidence. Further measures will need to follow, geared to growth and competitiveness. Of course, the essence is in the delivery: these measures have been now legislated, but the process of legislation and implementation of these measures is still under way. And secondly, it was quite clear from Berlin that they would not support the EFSF and the ESM running in parallel at any point. Your views? I do not want to enter into these matters, which are the competence of the leaders. I think I made it clear what view the ECB has of these fiscal rules. The question of what is legally the best way to implement them is really a matter for lawyers. I would stress one thing: it is very important to have a credible legal process, but it is also equally important to have something in place soon. I think these two features ought to be very much at the forefront of our minds – the credibility of the legal instrument and also the speed at which this is going to become a reality. My second question is, from a purely legal point of view, do you think there is any limitation on the ECB regarding the amount of government bonds that can be bought, as long as it can be justified on the basis of monetary policy considerations. At the present time we do not see a high probability of deflation. That is one point to keep in mind. The second point is, as I have said many times, that the purpose of the SMP is to reactivate the transmission channels of monetary policy. As I said in the statement to the European Parliament, the SMP is neither eternal nor infinite. We must keep this in mind and we do not want to circumvent Article 123 of the Treaty, which prohibits the monetary financing of governments. And my second question is, given that it appears that in the countries having the most economic trouble, inflation has not fallen very much, what makes you so confident that a slower economy – through some kind of output gap maybe – would actually lead to lower inflation? Because there does not seem to be a whole lot of evidence in the last couple of years that this is been happening. As regards your first question do not forget that the ECB is not a member of the IMF. More generally, as I just said, the mechanism by which money is being channelled to the European countries should not obscure the fact that we have a Treaty which says there should be no monetary financing of governments. The issue of whether the IMF could be used as a channel is legally very complex. But the need to respect the spirit of the Treaty should always be present in our minds. On the second point, what makes us sure that the inflation profile will gradually decline below 2% by the end of next year? Well, you gave part of the answer. The other part is that at the present time inflation is higher because of indirect taxes, energy prices and commodity prices. And, according to our projections, it should decline by the end of next year. It was a lively discussion – and one should not abuse the word “lively”, because we are central bank governors after all! Opinions were divided, not in terms of the substance but in terms of the timing. It was a majority decision. Secondly, when you read the headlines of the past few weeks, there is more and more talk of a break up. There are contingency plans for companies and contingency plans for governments. I, for one, am scared when I hear the euro being “talked to bits”. Do you not fear that something can become a self-fulfilling prophecy simply because more and more people talk about it? The paper currency is something which is built on confidence ultimately, and confidence is a very fragile beast. The answer to your second question is that, in the end, what matters are facts rather than a negative psychology that is self-fulfilling. And the facts are that if the leaders make substantial progress on the establishment of this new EU contract, we will see confidence returning and what looks like a spiral of self-fulfilling negative sentiment will stop. I do not think it is useful to speculate about break ups or such things. Because, in spite of everything that seems quite far-fetched at this point in time. On your other question: there are certain symptoms, for example the use of the deposit facility is now at a level which is not dissimilar to what we had after Lehman. This means that, in spite of the substantial, significant liquidity that the ECB has injected so far, a lot of this liquidity is re-deposited with the ECB, so it does not circulate. Also, we are observing a deleveraging process by the banks which is now very significant. All these developments can be explained by saying that there are funding pressures and there are pressures to raise capital ratios. And, to some extent, the measures that we have presented today are meant to address the funding pressures in particular. The wider use of collateral, the lengthening of the term funding, should give confidence and should give certainty to the funding profiles of the banking system at a time when next year is going to be a year when lots of bonds mature. In the first quarter alone something in the order of €230 billion of bank bonds will mature. The idea of lengthening the term funding in our liquidity facilities is also to see whether we can keep the banking system liquid in the presence of serious strains. Let me start by saying that this fiscal consolidation is unavoidable, because the situation we are observing would otherwise be unsustainable: so we do not have much of a choice here. The second point is that it is true that fiscal consolidations are contractionary in the short term. The next question to ask is what can be done to attenuate or offset this contractionary effect. Well, one channel relates to the confidence-enhancing effect that these fiscal consolidation measures have. However, we know that in the present situation this confidence-enhancing effect depends on at least two factors: first it requires that national economic policies be geared towards fiscal stability; and, second, it is linked to the progress made on designing the new European fiscal rules, fiscal set-up or fiscal compact. We are aware of this and that is why we always say that the structural reforms are essential for enhancing competitiveness, job creation and growth. There is one reason why it is so important to do this: because having a fiscal contraction induces in the short term a contractionary effect on growth, but if you enhance competitiveness at the same time, you can actually count on the external demand, on your net exports. So we have cases of countries which are undergoing a very significant fiscal consolidation, but in fact manage to keep their growth rate at levels that countries without competitiveness are not able to maintain. As I said before, we have a Treaty and the Treaty states what our primary mandate is, namely to maintain price stability. Also, the Treaty prohibits monetary financing. I am old enough to remember that, when this Treaty was written in the early 1990s, some of the countries around that table were actually doing what you suggest doing now, namely some of the central banks of these countries were financing the government expenditure of their governments through money creation, and the consequences were there for all of us to see. That is why, in a sense, this Treaty embodies the best tradition of the Deutsche Bundesbank, whereby monetary financing has always been prohibited. The answer to the second question is no, we did not discuss that. With regard to the first question, the point here is that it is legally complex, but upholding the spirit of the Treaty means that one cannot channel money in a way that circumvents the Treaty provisions. So, for example, if national central banks wanted to lend to the IMF, and then the IMF lent to Indonesia, China, that would be fine. But if the IMF were to use this money exclusively to buy bonds in the euro area, we do not think that this would be compatible with the Treaty. When I referred to the “other elements”, what I meant to say was that the other parts of the fiscal compact will fall into place much more easily once the fiscal rules are enacted and are in place. I am trying to get to Brussels, but as there are no flights available, I think I will participate in the dinner there tonight and in the summit tomorrow. As regards your second point I think the ECB has a very important role to play as the guardian of stability. The other process is eminently political: During these very hours, the fiscal agreement is being redesigned in such a way as to rebuild confidence in the euro area. We have our own ideas, our own views, and we have collaborated in this process. However, the ultimate decisions are really in the hands of the leaders, and this is how it should be because, in the end, they will bear the political responsibility for these decisions. No, we never discussed anything like that The decisions to undertake this exercise were taken at a time when the overall conditions were very different from what they are today. I think that the European Banking Authority (EBA) is aware of this and that the announcement will contain elements which will respond to your questions in a reassuring way. However, I would say that you will have to wait for the EBA’s announcement first. I do not want to comment on things that have not yet been published. No, in a sense that is the same question. As I was saying, the conditions in which this exercise is now being undertaken are very different. We want to make absolutely sure that this process does not aggravate the credit tightening that is taking place at the moment. It is important that banks raise their capital ratio, but they should do so in a way that will not induce a reduction in lending. This is certainly not an easy task at this point in time and we are aware of that. In a sense, the additional measures announced today are meant to channel financing to the real economy to help the banking industry and the financial services industry to keep lending and avoid credit tightening at a time when they are experiencing serious funding pressures. The broader use of collateral is meant to attract banks that, at present, do not have access to the refinancing facilities, namely small and medium-sized banks. And they are often the banks that finance the small and medium-sized enterprises. Just as a reminder, small and medium-sized enterprises account for about 60% of euro area employment, which is why the Governing Council views these measures as very important. It was a fact that was interpreted in many different ways. One may have some amounts that are not sterilised immediately. It happened six times in 80 operations. Does that mean that this amount stays unsterilised? No. In fact, the amount that was unsterilised at the time; was sterilised in the following days. So, we ought to be reassured about this. Sterilisation of the SMP is one of the preconditions for having this programme, as you all remember. But there may be technical aspects that sometimes do not ensure the complete sterilisation immediately. And secondly, you have mentioned Article 123 in the Treaty. Would you consider active buying at around the time certain instruments are issued to be something that would be state financing, and would you regard that as being against ECB law? On the first issue, we are aware of the technical complexities that would arise with the SMP having an infinite size, but we will think about this. As for the other question, one can construct many different cases. But, as I said before, the key thing is that we should not try to circumvent the spirit of the Treaty. No matter what the legal trick is, I think what matters for the people and what matters for the confidence and credibility of the institution is the spirit of this provision of the Treaty. On the first question, I would answer that we never pre-commit. On the second one, the rate cuts are meant to address a situation where you have weaker global growth, different conditions – worse conditions overall – and heightened uncertainty. So, overall, a domestic economy which is weakening. I would not use the word “toxic” for euro area bonds. I think the present stress conditions are mostly due to what I said before, i.e. the lack of the first two pillars of this compact. One – the national economic policies – is gradually falling into place, as we have seen in the last two weeks in various countries. But we certainly have to see more improvement on that front. And the second pillar, which is the EU re-design of the compact, is what is happening now. Let’s see. The ECB always suggests that cutting expenditure is better than increasing taxes. If we relate this to the Italian measures which have been taken, would you agree that there is a necessity for more expenditure cuts and less tax? How many economies are commenting on this? On the first question, if you read the press statement, you will see that the measures that have been decided are broad and complex. There are a variety of measures, of which the interest rate cut is only one. So, like the measures that were approved, the discussion was broad and complex. And it would be unthinkable to have unanimity on nine or ten different measures. On the second point, I have said before that what we have to do to attenuate, mitigate or even offset growth contraction comes from fiscal contraction. And there is a confidence effect that I have elaborated on before, as well as structural reforms, and obviously the composition of the fiscal contraction is also important. And a second question regarding the summit: the markets have great expectations that France and Germany will deliver something big. What do you think would happen were they not to deliver something that big? Well, commodity prices, energy prices and indirect taxes are all factors that we view as declining later on or as one-off factors. That is why we have this profile that says that inflation should decrease by the end of next year. As regards my expectations, I am very optimistic because I want to see something in place – it is essential that this summit delivers progress. Of course, it is easy for me to say, but I do not think we should refrain from hoping for great progress towards common fiscal rules. And rules that – as I was saying before – control, ex ante, secondary legislation and budgetary legislation. Rules of the kind I explained before. So, I really wish our leaders all the best, and the ECB is here. This does not mean that the ECB will respond, by the way! And secondly, as far as the future of the euro is concerned, would you not say that it was prudent to create some sort of contingency plan for a potential break-up of the euro area? I will respond to the second question first. It is thoroughly imprudent to create contingency plans where we see no likelihood of such events happening. On the first question, we do not discuss the Treaty. We comply with laws; we do not discuss laws. We do not push; we comply with legislation; we do not discuss legislation. Incidentally, I have been told that I should say something about the ECB’s acting. There is one decision that the Governing Council has taken that was not covered in my introductory statement. The Governing Council of the ECB has decided that it is prepared to act as an agent for the EFSF. The Governing Council has given approval for the ECB to act as an agent for the EFSF in its market operations. This follows a request by the EFSF. So, the ECB will prepare technically in order to be able to intervene in bond markets for and on behalf of the EFSF. The technical preparations will be launched without delay and should be completed within a few weeks. This, again, is a statement delivered in order to dispel the impression that the EFSF will never see the light of day. Obviously, this does not involve our balance sheet, as we will act as an agent. It is clear that the expectation is that lower interest rates will be passed on in the form of lower credit costs. For some credit operations, this will happen automatically. For example, in many countries you have mortgages that are indexed to the ECB’s policy rate. So, for these mortgages the pass-through is immediate. But there are certainly other sides to this issue. I think that each central bank has its institutional set-up, within which it operates. The ECB operates within the limits of the Treaty, and I said a moment ago what our primary mandate is, and especially what the Treaty says the ECB cannot do. I think any central bank is constrained by its institutional set-up. In the United States, as you know, the primary mandate of the Federal Reserve is completely different from ours. And the same is true of the Bank of England. No, we did not discuss that. We discussed only what has been announced. Some were in favour, and some were not in favour. "
03/11/2011,Draghi,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our press conference. Today is the first time that I have had the privilege and pleasure of chairing the meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. I am delighted to proceed now with our well-established practice of real-time communication and to report on the outcome of our meeting, together with the Vice-President. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. While inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% for some months to come, inflation rates are expected to decline further in the course of 2012 to below 2%. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. After today’s decision, inflation should remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Owing to their unfavourable effects on financing conditions and confidence, the ongoing tensions in financial markets are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year and beyond. The economic outlook continues to be subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. Some of these risks have been materialising, which makes a significant downward revision to forecasts and projections for average real GDP growth in 2012 very likely. In such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate; today’s decision takes this into account. Overall, it remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to ensure that euro area banks are not constrained on the liquidity side. All the non-standard monetary policy measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP growth in the euro area, which slowed in the second quarter of 2011 to 0.2% quarter on quarter, is expected to be very moderate in the second half of this year. There are signs that previously identified downside risks have been materialising, as reflected in unfavourable evidence from survey data. Looking forward, a number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area, including a moderation in the pace of global demand and unfavourable effects on overall financing conditions and on confidence resulting from ongoing tensions in a number of euro area sovereign debt markets. At the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to benefit from continued positive economic growth in the emerging market economies, as well as from the low short-term interest rates and the various measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area are confirmed in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. Downside risks notably relate to a further intensification of the tensions in some segments of the financial markets in the euro area and at the global level, as well as to the potential for these pressures to further spill over into the euro area real economy. They also relate to the impact of the still high energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 3.0% in October according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from September. Inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of last year, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. Looking ahead, they are likely to stay above 2% for some months to come, before falling below 2% in the course of 2012. Inflation rates are expected to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. This pattern reflects the expectation that, in an environment of weaker euro area and global growth, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced, taking also into account today’s decision. On the upside, the main risks relate to the possibility of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. In the current environment, however, inflationary pressure should abate. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. In fact, if sustained, sluggish economic growth has the potential to reduce medium-term inflationary pressure in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 3.1% in September 2011, up from 2.7% in August. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, was 2.7% in September, unchanged from August. As in August, inflows into M3 also reflect the heightened tensions in some financial markets. In particular, inflows into money market fund shares/units, as well as into repurchase agreements conducted through central counterparties, appear to have significantly affected monetary developments in September. The annual growth rate of M1 increased to 2.0% in September, from 1.7% in August. On the counterpart side, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations and to households in September, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, remained broadly unchanged compared with August, at 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. These figures do not signal that the heightened financial market tensions have affected the supply of credit up to September. However, as such effects can manifest themselves with lags, close scrutiny of credit developments is warranted in the period ahead. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective and looking through short-term volatility, underlying broad money and loan growth have stabilised over recent months. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion thus remains moderate. The overall size of monetary financial institutions’ balance sheets remained broadly unchanged over the past few months. The soundness of bank balance sheets will be a key factor in reducing potential negative feedback loop effects related to tensions in financial markets, thereby facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy over time. We therefore welcome the agreement of the European Council to proceed with the increase in the capital position of banks to 9% of core Tier 1 by the end of June 2012. We also fully support the call to national supervisors to ensure that banks' recapitalisation plans do not lead to excessive deleveraging. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. While inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% for some months to come, inflation rates are expected to decline further in the course of 2012 to below 2%. A cross-check with the information from our monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. After today’s decision, inflation should remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Owing to their unfavourable effects on financing conditions and confidence, the ongoing tensions in financial markets are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year and beyond. The economic outlook continues to be subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. Some of these risks have been materialising, which makes a significant downward revision to forecasts and projections for average real GDP growth in 2012 very likely. In such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate; today’s decision takes this into account. Overall, it remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Turning to fiscal policies, all euro area governments need to show their inflexible determination to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature as a key element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council takes note of the fiscal commitments expressed in the Euro Summit statement of 26 October 2011 and urges all governments to implement fully and as quickly as possible the measures necessary to achieve fiscal consolidation and sustainable pension systems, as well as to improve governance. The governments of countries under joint EU-IMF adjustment programmes and those of countries that are particularly vulnerable should stand ready to take any additional measures that become necessary. It is crucial that fiscal consolidation and structural reforms go hand in hand to strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. The Governing Council therefore calls upon all euro area governments to accelerate, urgently, the implementation of substantial and comprehensive structural reforms. This will help the euro area countries to strengthen competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. In this respect, labour market reforms are essential and should focus on measures to remove rigidities and to enhance wage flexibility, so that wages and working conditions can be tailored to the specific needs of firms. More generally, in these demanding times, moderation is of the essence in terms of both profit margins and wages. These measures should be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competition in product markets, particularly in services – including the liberalisation of closed professions – and, where appropriate, the privatisation of services currently provided by the public sector. At the same time, the Governing Council stresses that it is absolutely imperative that euro area national authorities rapidly adopt and implement the measures announced and recommended in the Euro Summit statement of 26 October 2011. We are now at your disposal for questions. Lots of questions, in one short question. But, yes, the decision was unanimous. Second, why did we do it? I think I did say why in the statement, but the points are basically the following: first of all, we observed a weakening of various components of aggregate demand, mainly consumption and foreign demand. We observed a worsening, both in hard data and survey data – worsening Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs), especially in manufacturing, in new orders growth, etc. We have also had two or three Consensus forecasts – we have the Eurobarometer and Consensus Economics showing that the likelihood of the weakening of the economic situation has gone up. We have concluded that the present situation would have a dampening effect on wages, prices and costs, so that our decision today is expected to maintain price stability in the medium term. The Securities Markets Programme (SMP) always has had, and was meant to have – as it has been stated since the very beginning – three characteristics. First of all, it is temporary. Second, it is limited in its amount and, third, it is justified on the basis of restoring the functioning of monetary policy transmission channels. So we should keep this in mind because this in a sense answers all the questions that one might have. The relationship with conditionality should be viewed from this perspective. We want our monetary policy to function. And I think that is where the main justification for the SMP lies. It is very hard to respond on a situation which is itself evolving swiftly. We are monitoring the situation closely and we are absolutely confident that if the measures that have been set out in the programme are implemented, together with the deliberations of the European Council, together with the strengthening of the banking system, together with the decision that the European Council has taken about the EFSF, that all this will quieten many concerns. But, first, we should go back to the first point I made, namely the implementation of the right economic policies. Other than that, it is very hard to comment on political developments in Greece now. There is no contrast. What we are observing now is slow growth heading towards a mild recession by the end of the year. The effects on inflation are different. Essentially, we have here a base effect, a purely statistical effect, whereby inflation will go down substantially in the course of 2012, to at, or below, 2%. So it will be consistent with our medium-term definition of price stability. In this sense, we are confident that our decision today is absolutely consistent with maintaining price stability. On top of this the weakening of the business cycle will in itself have dampening effects on wages, prices and costs, which will in turn have a dampening effect on inflation. I should also add that long-term inflation expectations are solidly anchored at 2% or even slightly less than that. These are really decisions that are not in the realm of the ECB’s competence: we know that there are discussions between the IMF and the Chinese government, but we are not part of them. No, we have not really been focusing on this and similar situations in our discussions today and yesterday. However, it is clear that – as I have said many times – the responsibility for maintaining financial stability and orderly financial conditions lies first and foremost with national economic policies. It is really pointless to think that sovereign bond rates could be stably brought down for a protracted period of time by external interventions. The main pillar of this is the national economic policy response, which is made up of two components: first, put your public finance in order and, second, undertake structural reforms. In doing so, competitiveness is enhanced, thereby fostering growth and job creation. In response to the first question, I think the real answer is that it is not in the Treaty and I have nothing to add to that: it is not in the Treaty. With regard to the second question, actually I have a question for you: what makes you think that the ECB becoming the lender of last resort for governments is what is needed to keep the euro area together? No, I do not think that this is really within the remit of the ECB. The remit of the ECB is maintaining price stability over the medium term. I mean the answer to this question – as you know by now, after eight years with Jean-Claude Trichet – is that we never pre-commit. On the first question, I have answered it already: it is not in the Treaty. We are all bound by the Treaty, and so we cannot really conceive of situations which are not envisaged in the Treaty. As regards my message tonight and tomorrow in Cannes, it does not really have to do with my hat as ECB President, because I have been invited there as Chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). And it is going to be my last day as Chairman of the FSB, as you know, because I will resign tomorrow. My message will be entirely and 100% based on financial stability considerations and the work the FSB is proposing to the G20 leaders for the coming year. And also, on the bond purchases, former President Trichet used to say that once the EFSF is operational, the ECB would not be buying bonds anymore. Will you make that same commitment? As I said before, we looked at the behaviour of several variables – the real economy, where we observe the weakening of various aggregate demand components; we looked at survey data, showing a worsening of the indicators that I mentioned before; we looked at other forecasts by other organisations, and they also showed a weakening of this – and then we looked at our monetary analysis. We cross-checked the two and we concluded that there was basically a weakening of the business cycle and also the likelihood that we may have to revise downwards our projections that will be presented next month. And we also concluded that there was no threat to price stability were we to lower by 25 basis points our key interest rates. No, we do not foresee deflation. On the SMP, as I said before, I think we have to judge the SMP by its stated functioning, its stated intentions, and its stated reasons. Namely, we said it is temporary, it is limited and it is justified by monetary policy considerations. And so, we will assess the SMP functioning from these angles. And for Vice-President Constâncio: you have seen in your time here at the ECB President Trichet in the chair where President Draghi is sitting now and you have seen President Draghi today. What is the difference in style and substance in the two leaderships? If I can comment, the second question is much better than the first! But, on the first point, I would not call my answer “legalistic”. There is very little that we have other than the Treaties. In a sense, the remit of this institution is enshrined in the Treaty. So, I do not think “legalistic” would be the right word. We have to have full respect for the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, and an issue like the break-up of the euro area is not a marginal one. So that is when the power of our Treaties comes into question. I do not know whether “legalistic” kind of belittles this concept – it is probably not the right word – but what it is meant to say is that we are using the Treaty as our reference point for decisions in areas as important as this one and, in that sense, it is the right word to use. Constâncio: On substance, it is the same. Do not forget that President Draghi has been a member of the Governing Council for many years, so he is totally embedded in the approach of the Governing Council over the years and you see also the continuity of analysis in the initial statement and in his answers. Let me remind you that, last month, President Trichet said that the possibility of a rate cut was discussed in the meeting, so the decisions today are not something that are out of line with the continuity of analysis and, as the President explained, the indicators since then have only aggravated and justified today’s decisions. So, I would say no differences on substance. On style, there is the same approach of taking the opinions and inputs of everyone. That is also to say, that there are, as always, personal differences. But I will perhaps protect myself by saying that it is too soon to tell! Just one meeting, just one observation! I would just like to add one thing. I think your question also has a deeper angle than just pure personalities, and the answer to your question is really that continuity, credibility and consistency are of the essence in the way we carry out our jobs. I have answered this question before. Let me just take a step back. For a long time spreads between sovereign bonds in the euro area were very narrow. In point of fact, they did not reflect the different realities of different countries. Countries were different because the state of their public finances was different; because their initial conditions were different: there were countries with low debt and countries with high debt; because their growth prospects were different; and because their competitiveness was different. And then we had the financial crisis at the end of 2007 and in 2008 and 2009. That increased risk aversion among all investors worldwide and made their analysis more perceptive of the different risks in different countries. And that is how the explosion of sovereign spreads started. As we had what the economists call “undershooting” for a long period of time, we may now have “overshooting”. But the way to react to this is not to count on external help that could alleviate the temporary market pressures, instead the real answer is actually to count on the countries’ capacity to reform themselves with the right economic policies – and I listed them before, in response to a previous question. You are told what the limit is every week. You receive a communication. Of course we do not do that. But there is continuous communication every week on the amounts that have been purchased. There is a strange “schizoid” attitude because some people say that our balance sheet is at risk, while others say we should expand our balance sheet to help everybody. In point of fact our balance sheet is not at risk and many things have been decided at the last European Council which made the Greek debt and the Greek counterparties compliant with our requirements. Our requirements for collateral are 1) that counterparties should be sound, and 2) that collateral should be adequate. There have been measures to recapitalise the banks, there have been measures of credit enhancement, and there have been measures giving guarantees for term funding. And there have been other measures that are reassuring as far as the ECB balance sheet is concerned. That is a different statement. That is why it is so hard to comment on a political situation, because it is evolving so fast. Until two hours ago there was a prospect of having a referendum in Greece. That had thrown markets into disarray, as you have seen in the last two days. Then people focused on what kind of questions were going to be asked in this referendum. And the answer that Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy were giving is that you should not ask detailed questions: are you in favour of higher taxes, are you in favour of this and that, etc. But one should ask the general question of whether a country is responsible and wants to stay in the euro area and wants to comply with the responsibilities that come with staying in the euro area. I think that was the meaning of the point made by the two Heads of State. And my second question is: can today’s decision about the interest rates help the ECB also to buy less Italian bonds or Buoni del Tesoro Poliennali or Spanish bonds? The answer to the second question is no. They are two separate issues, they have nothing in common. In answer to the first question, at the Cannes summit I will present the work of the FSB and the proposals of the FSB for the work to be done in the course of next year. There are proposals that concern the global CFI (GCFI) rules, there are proposals that concern the legislative and regulatory implementation of the over the counter (OTC) derivatives rules, where substantial standardisation is in progress, and there are proposals that concern the shadow banking system. We have substantially strengthened regulation for the regulated sector, but now we plan to increase the regulatory perimeter to include institutions that are at present in the so-called shadow or unregulated sector but actually carry out the same activities as banks. So they should be subject to the same rules as banks. These are the main proposals. Then there will be proposals about how to enhance or change the governance of the FSB. That is going to be the main thrust of my presentation tomorrow. Right now, the Chinese economy, even though it is mildly slowing, is probably one of the few sources of growth in the global economy. So I do expect China to make a very important contribution at the current G20 summit. Secondly, you were saying that you do not see any risk of deflation imminently. Is it fair to say, then, that expectations of a further interest rate cut would be fair? I have already answered the second question in saying that we never pre-commit. On the first question, one has to keep in mind that the Greek situation is exceptional and unique. In spite of the recent turmoil, the sovereign signatures remain a pillar of financial stability in the euro area and in the rest of the world. We are confident that the Irish government can comply with the measures announced, and the Irish government itself said that it would do whatever it takes. So, one has no reason to doubt the commitment of the government. Secondly, did Mr Trichet give you any advice for today’s meeting and, if so, have you followed it? No, Mr Trichet did not give me any specific advice for today’s meeting, but he gave me the comfort of his example, of his being a role model. I had the privilege to work with him for many years. On the first question, I have great admiration for the tradition of the Bundesbank. I was in the Treasury in Italy in the 1990s and we had many opportunities to work with Hans Tietmeyer and Helmut Schlesinger, so I developed a very great admiration for this institution throughout these years. As for the future, let me do my work and we will have periodic checks as to whether I am in sync with this tradition or deviating from it. The answer is that we are not forced by anybody. We are independent and make our own judgement. "
06/10/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, dear President Trichet, dear Vice-President Constancio, welcome to the regional office of Bundesbank in Berlin where the ECB Governing Council held its 319th meeting earlier today. It has become a tradition that twice a year the Governing Council meets outside Frankfurt with one of the Eurosystem national central banks acting as host. This time it was the Deutsche Bundesbank’s turn, and I must say it has been an honour to welcome the Governing Council here in the German capital. Before I give the floor to President Trichet I would like to use this opportunity to offer my sincere thanks to him. As you will be aware, today he chaired his penultimate Governing Council meeting and will be giving his final post-meeting press conference in a little while. This monthly press briefing has been like a piano that you have played as masterfully as any professional pianist would. Over the past 8 years you have commanded this stage – usually in Frankfurt – to gently steer market expectations using a careful and deliberate choice of words to give clear messages to the markets. I am certain that the corps of journalists will miss the typically French elegance with which you have chaired past press conferences. Although I became a member of the Governing Council only recently I feel lucky and grateful to have had first-hand experience of your diplomatic but consistently focussed style of chairmanship. As I already mentioned, you have been President of the ECB for 8 years, the last 4 years of which have proved very demanding. It is no overstatement when I say, that, Jean-Claude has fought passionately and with tireless and unconditional conviction to overcome the European debt crisis. What is often forgotten these days, are the achievements of the Eurosystem in the past decade. You would be right to point out that “we have delivered price stability for 330 million people”. This is in large part thanks to your own personal efforts and I would like to use this opportunity to thank you on behalf of the Bundesbank and the other national central banks for the excellent job you have done over the past 8 years. During your time living and working in Germany you have often stressed how fond you are of this country and its language. I therefore hope that we will have the continued pleasure of seeing you in Germany again many times in the future. But now, Mr. President, the floor is yours. * * * Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Berlin. Let me take the opportunity to warmly thank President Weidmann for his invitation and kind hospitality. I would also like to express our special gratitude to the staff of the Deutsche Bundesbank for the excellent organisation of our meeting. Let me now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation has remained elevated and incoming information has confirmed our view that inflation is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead but to decline thereafter. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. Ongoing tensions in financial markets and unfavourable effects on financing conditions are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year. The economic outlook remains subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. At the same time, short-term interest rates remain low. It remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. The Governing Council has decided to conduct two longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), one with a maturity of approximately 12 months in October and the other with a maturity of approximately 13 months in December. The operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rate in both operations will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations (MROs) over the life of the respective LTRO, and interest will be paid when each operation matures. These operations will be conducted in addition to the regular and special-term refinancing operations, which remain unaffected. The Governing Council has also decided to continue conducting its MROs as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period of 2012 on 10 July 2012. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period (i.e. around the end of the second quarter) of 2012. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. In addition, the Governing Council has decided to conduct the three-month LTROs to be allotted on 25 January, 29 February, 28 March, 25 April, 30 May and 27 June 2012 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided to launch a new covered bond purchase programme (CBPP2). The programme will have the following modalities: The purchases will be for an intended amount of EUR 40 billion. The purchases will have the capacity to be conducted in the primary and secondary markets and will be carried out by means of direct purchases. The purchases will start in November 2011 and are expected to be fully implemented by the end of October 2012. Further details on the modalities of CBPP2 will be announced after the Governing Council meeting of 3 November 2011. The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to ensure that euro area banks are not constrained on the liquidity side. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP growth in the euro area, after slowing in the second quarter of 2011 to 0.2% quarter on quarter, is now expected to be very moderate in the second half of this year. In particular, a number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area, including a moderation in the pace of global demand, falling consumer and business confidence, and unfavourable effects on financing conditions resulting from ongoing tensions in a number of euro area sovereign debt markets. At the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to benefit from continued positive growth in the emerging market economies as well as from the low short-term interest rates and the various measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. Downside risks notably relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets in the euro area and at the global level, as well as to the potential for these pressures to further spill over into the euro area real economy. They also relate to the still high energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 3.0% in September 2011, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.5% in August. Inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of last year, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months but to decline thereafter. This pattern reflects the expectation of relatively stable wage growth developments in the context of moderate economic growth. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. On the upside, the main risks relate to the possibility of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was 2.8% in August 2011, up from 2.1% in July. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, was 2.8% in August, after 2.6% in July. A number of factors, possibly related to the intensification of tensions in some financial markets, could have had an upward effect on the components of M3. In particular, sizeable inflows into overnight deposits and money market fund shares/units, as well as a substantial inflow into repurchase agreements, appear to have driven monetary developments in August. The inflow into repurchase agreements mainly reflected secured lending in the interbank market, which was increasingly settled via central counterparties that are allocated to the money-holding sector. Overall, M3 growth was driven in particular by the increase in the annual growth rate of M1 from 1.0% in July to 1.7% in August and the increase in the annual growth rate of marketable instruments. On the counterpart side, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations and to households in August, both adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, remained unchanged from July, at 2.2% and 2.7% respectively. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, trends in broad money and loan growth have broadly stabilised over recent months. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion thus remains moderate. The situation of the banking sector calls for particular attention, taking into account the interplay between sovereign risk issues and banks’ funding needs. As we have done on previous occasions, the Governing Council urges banks to do all that is necessary to reinforce their balance sheets, to retain earnings, to ensure moderation in remuneration, and to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases. Where necessary, they should take full advantage of government support measures, which should be made totally operational, including the possibility in future for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to lend to governments in order to recapitalise banks. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation has remained elevated and incoming information has confirmed our view that inflation is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead but to decline thereafter. A cross-check with the information from our monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. Ongoing tensions in financial markets and unfavourable effects on financing conditions are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year. The economic outlook remains subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. At the same time, short-term interest rates remain low. It remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. Turning to fiscal policies, with financial market uncertainty remaining high, all governments need to take decisive and frontloaded action to bolster public confidence in the sustainability of government finances. All euro area governments need to show their inflexible determination to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature as a key element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. Countries under joint EU-IMF adjustment programmes as well as those particularly vulnerable to financial market conditions need to unambiguously implement all announced measures for fiscal consolidation and the strengthening of domestic fiscal frameworks, and they need to stand ready to take any additional measures that may become necessary owing to the evolution of their situation. Fiscal consolidation and structural reforms must go hand in hand to strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. The Governing Council therefore urges all euro area governments to decisively and swiftly implement substantial and comprehensive structural reforms. This will help these countries to strengthen competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. In this respect, labour market reforms are key, with a focus on the removal of rigidities and the implementation of measures which enhance wage flexibility. In particular, we should see the elimination of automatic wage indexation clauses and a strengthening of firm-level agreements. More generally, in these demanding times, moderation is of the essence in terms of both profit margins and wages. These measures should be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competition in product markets, particularly in services – including the liberalisation of closed professions – and, where appropriate, the privatisation of services currently provided by the public sector, thereby facilitating productivity growth and supporting competitiveness. At the same time, the Governing Council urges all euro area governments to fully implement all aspects of the decisions they took on 21 July 2011. Let me close with some personal remarks. This is my last press conference following a meeting of the Governing Council. I remember my first press conference, eight years ago, as if it were yesterday. I want to tell you that it has been a great pleasure to have this regular dialogue with the press, with all of you. We have, together, each of us with our different responsibilities, analysed the European and global situation throughout these years. We were never in calm waters. But for more than four years now, we have been experiencing turbulent waters, storms, unexpected hurricanes. In demanding times, regular, real-time and transparent communication is more important than ever. The channels of national, European and global communication which you are responsible for are crucial for the appropriate functioning of markets, for the correct understanding of economists and economic agents, and for the information of the people of Europe, our fellow citizens, to whom, as an independent institution, we are accountable. Eight years ago the concept of a press conference immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council was still considered a bold innovation. Today it is part of the global state of the art. And the Vice-President and I also have to thank you for that. We are now at your disposal for questions. And a second question is: Is the Governing Council unanimous and determined in rejecting the idea of leveraging the EFSF or the European bailout fund, ESM, by making it an ECB counterparty? Thank you very much As I said, the Governing Council found short term interest rates to be low. The large number of decisions taken today are monetary policy decisions in the domain of non-standard measures to help restore a better transmission of monetary policy in circumstances in which we have markets that are not functioning correctly or segments of market that have been disrupted. As regards the decisions taken, we had a consensus. For your second question: the Governing Council does not consider it to be appropriate for the ECB to leverage the EFSF. We believe that the governments have all necessary capacity to leverage the EFSF themselves. And the second thing is: how urgent do you think we need a recapitalisation of the banks, in tandem with getting the ESM on track? On your first question: as you could see, we have two categories of monetary policy instruments at our disposal. We have what we call the ‘standard measures’ and we have ‘non-standard measures’. Standard measures are always designed to deliver price stability via interest rates and to make sure that we are credible in delivering price stability. At the moment, we considered that it was appropriate to leave interest rates where they are, taking into account also that interest rates are low and that we feel that, in so doing, we are fully credible in the delivery of price stability. Let me only mention that we are credible when you look at the past. We have delivered price stability, as Jens has just said, for 332 million of our fellow citizens, a price stability that is in line with our definition and is better than it was over the last fifty years before the euro. And for the future, we are equally credible with respect to delivering price stability over the next ten years. The break-even inflation rate five years forward/forward is a good measure of our credibility and stands, at a level around 1.8%, so that it is fully in line with our definition. And that is extremely important. It permits related expectations in Europe to be solidly anchored, which is good for sustainable growth and job creation. As regards the non-standard measures; we were particularly keen to take the appropriate ones. We decided on two longer term (12- and 13-month) refinancing operations with fixed rates and at full allotment. We decided to prolong the concept of full allotment at fixed rates for the one-week, one-month and three-month refinancing operations, and not only for the current quarter and the first quarter of next year, but also for the second quarter of next year. Furthermore, we decided to embark on covered bond purchases. This gives you an idea of the magnitude of the decisions we have taken for monetary policy purposes in order to help restore a better transmission mechanism for our monetary policy. As concerns recapitalization, we have been very clear on the necessity of reinforcing the balance sheets of the banks by various means. This includes putting aside earnings, being moderate in the field of remuneration, turning to the private sector for a reinforcement of the balance sheets and recapitalisation, as well as, where necessary, going to the backstop of the governments, including the EFSF possibility which has been offered after the meeting of the Heads of State or Government on 21 July. Second, given this worsening economic outlook, then I would like you to clarify whether or not the decisions on the covered bonds, liquidity provision and interest rates were all unanimous? Third, I have a question for Mr Weidmann: There has been some discussion about unburdening the EFSF with the bond buys; would that alleviate your concerns about the Securities Markets Programme? With regard to the first question; as always we had a long discussion on the pros and cons of all the decisions that we could take. We discussed the pros and cons of decreasing rates, as well as the pros and cons of maintaining rates. After this thorough, complete, comprehensive and long discussion, we decided by consensus to maintain rates. In addition, with regard to the non-standard measures, we also had a long discussion on the pros and cons of each particularity of these various non-standard measures. You can see that these are very important measures to help restore a better transmission of our monetary policy, because for us the main concern was to ensure that our own decision on the standard measure would be correctly transmitted to the full body of the euro area, to its 332 million citizens. After having weighed up the pros and cons we decided by consensus to take the measures that were taken. As for the third question, perhaps I could give the floor to you, Jens. Weidmann: I can be pretty brief on this, as the Bundesbank position in general is known – the sooner the EFSF manages to address the root causes of the problem, the better it is! And, as you have seen, the Governing Council decided to again urge governments to apply all of the decisions taken on 21 July. Right at the very beginning of the set up of the ECB we decided that, given the very nature of this institution, which issues currency for 17 countries, it was extremely important to concentrate on the one pertinent entity, namely the Governing Council of the ECB, which decides for the 17 countries. After due consideration we decided that it was much better and necessary for us in our particular situation – which is not that of the United States, the United Kingdom, or Japan, which all issue a currency for one country – to be extremely transparent. This involved providing, in real time, the Introductory Statement, which communicates the sentiment of the Governing Council to the media and to our fellow citizens. Immediately after the Governing Council meeting, we also stand ready to respond to questions from the press. These were new concepts, but they have now spread world over – thanks also to the journalists at the press conference: and we are proud that this concept appears to be state of the art. In response to your particular question, we believe that the Introductory Statement gives you the pertinent information, namely the basis of the decision of the Governing Council. We do not think that providing additional information on the individual positions would be in line with the fact that we are the central bank for 17 sovereign countries and for 332 million people, and therefore each of us conveys the position of the Governing Council as a single entity. First of all, we have already said that our working assumption is that what was signed by those 17 Heads of State or Government is implemented. If it were not the case, we could not work. Second, the SMP is ongoing, and we do expect that the EFSF will be up and running as soon as possible, with the capacity to intervene on the secondary market, which is one of the very important decisions of 21 July. I would add that it is extremely important that governments implement what they decided and demonstrate that they are indeed doing what is necessary to preserve financial stability. We cannot replace governments. We have lived up to our responsibilities in full in difficult times. We stand ready to live up to our responsibilities in full today. Don’t think that the decisions that we took today are not extremely important – including the longer term refinancing operations, one of which has a maturity of more than 13 months, so that it covers the end of 2012. All of these are very important decisions. Question - French: Pour fêter votre départ, une petite question en français M. Trichet. Vous n’avez pas le sentiment de laisser la zone euro au bord du gouffre puisque la question qui se pose, et que les citoyens se posent, et que les marchés se posent manifestement, est de savoir si l’euro existera encore dans 10 ans? Puis je profite aussi de la présence de M. Weidmann, parce que ce n’est pas tous les jours qu’un Français peut poser une question au président de la Bundesbank. Vous avez dit récemment que vous étiez opposé, tout comme votre prédécesseur, au programme de rachat d’obligations sur le marché secondaire parce que la crise n’était pas assez grave. Je voudrais juste savoir ce que vous entendez par une crise grave, si la crise actuelle pour vous n’est pas assez grave. À quel moment vous perdez le sommeil à la Bundesbank? Trichet -  French: Depuis le début de la période de turbulences, la Banque centrale européenne est intervenue de manière inédite. Le 9 août 2007, nous avons pris pour la première fois la décision de donner de la liquidité à taux fixe et sans limites, et cette décision a marqué d’ailleurs le début de la crise, le début de la période de turbulences. Nous n’avons jamais sous-estimé la gravité de ce que nous étions en train de vivre. Nous avons dit, et j’ai répété au nom du Conseil des gouverneurs, après la banqueroute de Lehman Brothers, que nous étions dans la crise la plus grave depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale, qui aurait pu être la crise la plus grave depuis la Première Guerre mondiale. Donc, les événements que nous vivons sont difficiles, exigeants et ils appellent de la part de toutes les autorités des réponses qui soient à la mesure des défis. C’est ce que nous essayons de faire et c’est ce que nous pensons que les autorités doivent faire, qu’il s’agisse des exécutifs, des Parlements, des autres institutions européennes. Les temps sont difficiles. Nous devons tous être à la mesure des défis qui nous sont lancés. Question – English translation: In honour of your departure, a quick question in French. Mr Trichet, do you not feel that you are leaving the euro area on the edge of the abyss, since the question that people are asking themselves, and that the markets are clearly asking themselves, is whether the euro area will still exist in ten years’ time? And I’d also like to take advantage of the presence of Mr Weidmann, as it’s not every day that a Frenchman can ask the President of the Bundesbank a question. You said recently that, like your predecessor, you were opposed to the programme of bond purchases on the secondary market, as the crisis was not sufficiently severe. I would just like to know what you consider to be a “severe crisis”, if the current crisis is not, for you, sufficiently severe. At what moment do you begin to lose sleep at the Bundesbank? Trichet –  English translation : Ever since this period of turbulence began, the European Central Bank has always intervened immediately. On 9 August 2007 we took the decision, for the first time, to provide unlimited amounts of liquidity at a fixed rate, and this marked the beginning of the crisis, the beginning of the period of turbulence. We never underestimated the gravity of the situation we have faced. We said – and I have said this repeatedly on behalf of the members of the Governing Council – that we faced the worst crisis since World War II, and that it could have been the worst since World War I. The events that we are dealing with are difficult and challenging, and they require that all authorities respond in a manner which is consistent with the scale of the challenge. That is what we are trying to do, and this is what we are asking all other authorities to do, be it the executive branches, parliaments or other European institutions. These are difficult times. We all have to be up to the challenge. Weidmann: I am very grateful that you don’t expect me to reply in French, because my French is getting a bit rusty. I have to say, his French is fantastic! Weidmann: I don’t want to put it to the test today. I will just try to answer in very abstract terms, because this is not an issue that we discussed today, and I think we should focus on the decisions that were discussed by the Governing Council today. I mean, a judgement on the use of a specific instrument is based first of all on an analysis of the situation. This is what you are referring to. But second, it is also based on the efficiency of the specific instrument. And I think I will leave it at that, without elaborating further. Secondly, bank recapitalisation. I am sure the ECB has done its own sums. We have had published figures from the IMF. We have had published figures from the EBA based on stress tests or capital needs. What is the ECB’s rough assessment of the amounts of extra capital required by eurozone banks? And thirdly, seeing as this is your last press conference, I would just maybe ask you – you were one of the founders of the euro, you helped write the Maastricht Treaty, you have lived through the “storms”, as you said, of the last four years – on this day, as you leave, do you feel a little bit of disappointment perhaps about the degree of solidarity and the sense of unity amongst European leaders today? First of all, as you very rightly mentioned, we qualify the way we take decisions by observing that there was unanimity, consensus or majority vote. As you know, according to the Treaty and as an executive institution, the European Central Bank takes its monetary policy decisions by simple majority. I have to say, however, that most often we decide with either unanimity or by consensus. But everything is possible. In the present case, I would say that all of us reflected on the pros and cons of decreasing or maintaining rates and we considered, taken everything into account, that it was better to maintain rates as they are. We did exactly the same analysis of the pros and cons of the non-standard measures. We are a central bank which issues a currency for 17 countries and we had to consider that there is a serious problem of the transmission of our monetary policy decision because financial stability is not ensured at the level of the euro area as a whole and because we have a number of countries which have their own ‘risk-free’ benchmark rates at levels that are quite different from country to country. So, taken everything into account, and having weighed up very thoroughly the pros and cons, we took our decision by consensus. But I draw your attention to the extreme importance of the non-standard measures that we took today. As regards the capital of the banking sector, we have not devised an amount of money which would be necessary. I do not think that having such a figure is of importance. What counts is that each particular commercial bank, each particular financial institution, is up and running with the appropriate credibility vis-à-vis its own environment. That calls for decisions that are not alike everywhere and global figures do not really represent what is appropriate. I can give you an example (amongst others). When you compute the potential losses or potential profits that might be registered by the various banks, depending on the various securities they have, you arrive at figures that might be very different. Interest rates have been up for some securities and down for others. And when you compute the full addition for the euro area as a whole, you get figures that might be very different, depending on whether you do or do not take into account the cases where the credible securities have seen their value increase. What we are saying is very clear: do all that is necessary. Of course, we do not have the executive responsibility: it has to be done through the European Banking Authority (EBA) at the level of the euro area as a whole, by the various national supervisors and, when necessary, you have the backstops. I have confidence in the EBA to implement what is necessary. You know that we had an ESRB meeting recently, followed by a press communiqué which was also very clear on this point. But again, the strong call to the banks and to all the responsible entities is very clear. On your question about the present situation, let me first say that we should not confuse the euro as a currency with the issue of the difficulty of preserving financial stability in the euro area as a whole. The euro as a currency has delivered price stability, as I said and as Jens said, better than was the case during the last 50 years before the euro. That is a fundamental feature of the euro which is backing its credibility. Second, the euro is credible according to the markets and according to the information we extract from the markets for the next ten years. It is credible for keeping its value. You can see what other countries and other central banks have been doing, mentioning en passant the Swiss Central Bank. So, one should avoid this confusion between the euro as a currency and the issue of financial stability in the euro area. We are very proud to have issued the euro as a currency almost 13 years ago. The real difficulty, namely preserving financial stability in the euro area as a whole, is due to a very simple reason: governance has been insufficient. Governance was insufficient and, at certain moments, governance has been put into question by the major countries of Europe. We had to fight to maintain the Stability and Growth Pact. We had to fight to obtain the reinforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact to introduce the surveillance of competitive indicators and imbalances inside the euro area. You know that our position is constant. I was before the European Parliament only a few days ago. I could refer again to what I said in my first hearing in Parliament eight years ago, which was to warn against any weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact and to warn against any loose policies on the fiscal side. That was eight years ago and four years before the start of the financial turbulences! And secondly, I was wondering if, upon leaving, there is anything that you regret yourself or the ECB doing or not doing during your term. Or do you take the same line as Edith Piaf, who famously sings “Je ne regrette rien”? Now that you implicitly mention Jürgen, let me say that Jürgen Stark has been devoted to Europe and the European construction for 18 years. I have immense esteem and respect for him. He has taken his decision for personal reasons. He has always been incredibly dedicated to Europe, loyal to the institution and to Europe. Again, I have immense esteem and respect for Jürgen and, I also have to say, a great friendship with him. As regards our decisions, all our decisions are difficult to take, particularly when times are very demanding. All the members of the Governing Council – we are 23 of us at the table – are fully aware of the responsibility. I am confident that, when we look back at what has been done, we will see that we were trying to do our best in a very difficult environment and in an environment where governance was not at the level of what was required. Ever since the problems on 9 August 2007, we, at the level of the Governing Council, have been lucid in our judgement. We said, “This is very grave”, when many were saying “No, it’s not grave, it’s not a big deal”, etc. We have the responsibility of delivering price stability and being credible in that delivery! And t we also have the responsibility of passing the appropriate messages to all other partners – governments, parliaments, public opinion – and we try to do that. It’s not easy. And, from time to time, we are passing messages that are difficult. But it is our duty. This is also because, in Europe, not many have an opportunity to see the big picture: to have the picture of Europe as a whole and also the picture of Europe’s position in the world. We have a responsibility and an angle of vision which permit us to have the big picture. And it’s our duty to relay what we see to those responsible in other domains. As you heard, we have decided to embark on a programme of covered bonds – these covered bonds are issued by banks and backed by collateral, not by the sovereign. As regards the SMP, it is an ongoing programme, and we publish the figures every week. The covered bond programme that we have decided on today is of the same nature as our first covered bond purchase programme (which ended in June 2010). We will announce the exact technical details later on, but this is not to be confused with the SMP. As regards the comparison between the central banks, I used to make the comparison with the US Federal Reserve. If you take the balance sheet of the ECB and the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve – I am talking about the ECB plus all the central banks of the Eurosystem so that we have the consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem – you will see that, since the start of the crisis, our balance sheet has increased by 77% and the balance sheet of the Fed has increased by 226%. This figure, of course, has to be permanently updated. But it gives an idea of what we and what other central banks have been doing in this respect. We will recruit you as Master of Communications! I have already responded in terms of volume and, frankly speaking, I think that all the observations about the risks taken do not seem appropriate. We are very careful in what we are doing and always try to have a good way of handling very difficult situations. I mentioned the size of the balance sheet and its increase. It goes without saying that we apply risk management as attentively and cautiously as possible. Second, there is an international organisation advising banks, advising governments to oblige banks to recapitalise. Would you support this? Third, what do you have to say to those suggesting that the ECB is going beyond its mandate? Would you maybe answer that we are living in a state of emergency? First, when the EFSF was decided on, we did indeed call on governments to leverage the EFSF as much as possible in order to ensure financial stability. Second, I said very clearly that banks should reinforce their capital base, and we rely on the EBA and the decisions taken at the level of Europe as a whole to ensure that they do that in the best fashion possible. With regard to your last question, I have already said that it is our duty to convey messages. We are not, cannot be and do not want to be a substitute for other institutions, be they European or national, or governments or parliaments. We only convey messages. These may or may not be listened to, but it is our strong duty to pass on what we see and what we think, given our responsibility and the angle from which we can view the situation. It is certainly not to be qualified as going beyond our mandate. I also just wanted to return to a question that my colleague asked before: do you have any regrets about the last eight years, either from the ECB’s standpoint or from the governments’? As regards your first question, we are experiencing a global crisis. From the very beginning, we could see that it was going to be a major global crisis with a lot of structural changes. I myself and all my colleagues have been asked: “Is it over?”, “Are we now in calm waters?”, “Do you think that we are well on the road to returning to normality?” Of course I was very careful to avoid responding to such questions. Instead, I would say: “It is an ongoing process. We have to be up to the new challenges that are largely unpredictable, let’s continue to be permanently alert, “credible alertness” is of the essence.” It is clear that we are experiencing a major structural change at the level of the global economy and finance, which is an ongoing process that requires considerable adjustment in the advanced economies. And not surprisingly, for the first time since World War II, the crisis is very much concentrated in the advanced economies – the United States, Japan, Europe – and we all have to try to adjust in the best fashion possible. It is not a short-term phenomenon. Second, do you feel that the ECB’s role in the Irish crisis has been well understood by the people of Ireland, and what would you say to people who think that the ECB has maybe been too harsh on Ireland, particularly in relation to the repayment of senior bank bonds? On the first question, it is a work in progress. We are calling for all decisions to be implemented fully, expeditiously and comprehensively, both by the government of Greece and by Europe as a whole. And it is a work in progress. The troika is on-site in Greece: we will see its report. On Ireland, I have already said on similar occasions that the ECB and the Eurosystem had been very forthcoming vis-à-vis Ireland, as all figures are demonstrating, extraordinarily forthcoming. That being said, I also have to say that Ireland is doing a very good job, and that the credibility of Ireland is visibly improving, month after month. Second, when the ECB was set up, it was said that there was “a lot of Bundesbank” in the ECB in terms of the monetary analysis, its independence, the idea of not financing governments. If we compare the situation at your first press conference eight years ago with today how much of the Bundesbank would you say was in the ECB in 2003 and how much is left today? As regards your first question, we have not discussed limits. Second, the euro area is made up of 17 countries and 332 million people. In France, I was considered the ‘clone’ of my friend Hans Tietmeyer and I was, I have to say, very proud when after five years of the Banque de France’s independence, we had an average yearly inflation which was a little bit below the Bundesbank’s at that time. But it was also in a period which was difficult for the Bundesbank, because it was after reunification, so I do not take too much pride in that! We are fully respecting what the people of Europe have asked of us, and the people of Europe have asked us to deliver price stability. It is our primary mandate. And we have to deliver price stability. Have we delivered price stability? Yes! We have delivered price stability for the 332 million fellow citizens. Have we delivered price stability in Germany? Yes! 1.55% over the first 13 years as a yearly average (the 13 years are not yet fully complete). Are we credible in delivering price stability over the next ten years? Yes! So, we have all really been as faithful to our mandate as we can be. These are not words, these are deeds! And on top of that, we have had to cope with the worst crisis since World War II. And that is also something which calls upon us to do what we have judged appropriate to do and also to convey messages that are not easy to convey and, from time to time, may seem a bit harsh to the destinatories. My second question is related to the letter that you sent, together with your colleague from the Bank of Italy, to the Italian authorities: do you feel that the things and the message that you sent them have been fulfilled so far? Lastly, I wanted to ask you if you have any advice that you can share with us, besides the ample advice that you will give your successor in private when he is installed next month? On the first question, we have been very clear since the very beginning. We said that we expect the governments to be responsible for restoring financial stability, both individually through their own decisions – and it is of course always the first responsibility of the country itself – and then through the collegial decisions taken by the various governments. When financial stability is preserved by Governments, we do not have the problem of helping restore a better transmission of monetary policy. So our working assumption is very clear. The governments take the responsibility of restoring financial stability and we do not have to help restore a better transmission mechanism. That is very clear and was very clear when we saw the decision of 21 July. As regards the letter; we are not negotiating with anybody. We see things that are important, we make a judgement, we send messages – on the level of the Eurosystem as a whole – and we look at what was decided. Some decisions were taken in principle, then a challenged, then finally implemented. This is work in progress because there are many other measures. You have seen that we insist very much on structural measures that increase the growth potential of the euro area as a whole and of each particular national economy. This really is of the essence. And as regards Mario, I would say that he knows better than anybody how we work. He is one of us. He took all the decisions with all of us. I do not think he needs any particular counsel. He knows very well how the Governing Council functions and is totally dedicated to our primary mandate, as we all are. "
08/09/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead before declining next year. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate, while monetary liquidity remains ample. As expected, the pace of economic growth in the euro area decelerated in the second quarter, following strong growth in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow moderately, subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. At the same time, short-term interest rates are low. While our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, some financing conditions have tightened. It remains essential for monetary policy to focus on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments. The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to ensure that euro area banks are not constrained on the liquidity side. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP growth decelerated to 0.2% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2011, after 0.8% in the first quarter. As expected, temporary factors which had boosted growth in the early part of the year ceased, and adverse effects resulted from the Japanese earthquake and the lagged impact of past oil price increases. Looking ahead, a number of developments seem to be dampening the underlying momentum in the euro area, including a moderation in the pace of global growth, related declines in equity prices and in business confidence, and unfavourable effects resulting from ongoing tensions in a number of euro area sovereign debt markets. As a consequence, real GDP growth is expected to increase very moderately in the second half of this year. At the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to benefit from ongoing growth in the global economy as well as from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the various measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.4% and 1.8% in 2011 and between 0.4% and 2.2% in 2012. Compared with the June 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for real GDP growth in 2011 and 2012 have been revised downwards. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to the economic outlook for the euro area are on the downside, in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. Downside risks mainly relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets in the euro area and at the global level, as well as to the potential for these pressures to spill over into the euro area real economy. They also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in August 2011, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from July. We have now seen inflation rates at relatively high levels since the end of last year, with higher energy and other commodity prices as the main drivers. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Thereafter, on the basis of the path implied by futures markets for oil prices, inflation rates should fall below 2% in 2012. This pattern reflects the expectation of relatively stable wage growth developments in the context of moderate economic growth. The September 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area embody these considerations and foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.5% and 2.7% for 2011 and between 1.2% and 2.2% for 2012. In comparison with the June 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the range for HICP inflation in 2011 remains unchanged, while the range for 2012 is slightly narrower. It is necessary to recall that the staff projections are conditional on a number of purely technical assumptions. The Governing Council views the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as being broadly balanced. On the upside, the main risks relate to the possibility of higher than assumed increases in oil and non-oil commodity prices as well as increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was 2.0% in July 2011, after 1.9% in June. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector was 2.4% in July, after 2.5% in June. Looking beyond the monthly data and the effects of special factors, trends in broad money and loan growth have broadly stabilised over recent months. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 decreased to 0.9% in July, whereas growth in other short-term deposits remained unchanged at 3.7%. These developments continue to partly reflect the gradual increase in the remuneration of short-term time and savings deposits over recent months. On the counterpart side, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations continued to edge up slightly, from 1.5% in June to 1.6% in July, whereas the annual growth of loans to households seems to have levelled off at around 3%. The overall size of MFI balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months. Where it is necessary to provide adequate scope to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation, in line with the findings of the recent stress tests. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead before declining next year. A cross- check with the information from our monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate, while monetary liquidity remains ample. As expected, the pace of economic growth in the euro area decelerated in the second quarter, following strong growth in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow moderately, subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. At the same time, short-term interest rates are low. While our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, some financing conditions have tightened. It remains essential for monetary policy to focus on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments. Turning to fiscal policies, a number of governments have announced additional measures to ensure the achievement of their consolidation targets and to strengthen the legal basis for national fiscal rules. To ensure credibility, it is now crucial that the announced measures be frontloaded and implemented in full. Governments need to stand ready to implement further consolidation measures, notably on the expenditure side, if risks regarding the attainment of the current fiscal targets materialise. Countries that enjoy better than expected economic and fiscal developments should make full use of this room for manoeuvre for faster deficit and debt reduction. All euro area governments need to demonstrate their inflexible determination to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature, which is a decisive element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. Fiscal consolidation and structural reforms must go hand in hand to strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. The Governing Council therefore urges all euro area governments to decisively and swiftly implement substantial and comprehensive structural reforms. This will help these countries to strengthen competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. In this respect, labour market reforms are key, with a focus on the removal of rigidities and the implementation of measures which enhance wage flexibility. In particular, we should see the elimination of automatic wage indexation clauses and a strengthening of firm-level agreements so that wages and working conditions can be tailored to firms’ specific needs. These measures should be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competition in product markets, particularly in services – including the liberalisation of closed professions – and, where appropriate, the privatisation of services currently provided by the public sector, thereby facilitating productivity growth and supporting competitiveness. We are now at your disposal for questions. And my second question is: did you also discuss measures that may increase liquidity to the market at this time? And is there enough liquidity to the banking sector? First, we were unanimous in taking today’s decision as regards the interest rates. Second, as regards the balance of risks for both growth and inflation: if I compare the situation today with what we said a month ago, I would say that a month ago we considered the risks to growth to be balanced, which is not the case today. This is based on the new analyses, presented by the ECB staff projections and the judgement of the Governing Council – which does not necessarily endorse the staff projections but makes its own judgement. The significant change is that today we consider that there is a downside risk to growth. As regards inflation, last month the sentiment was that there was an upside risk to inflation, while today the judgement is that the risks to inflation are balanced. These are the two major changes in the overall assessment of the Governing Council regarding the present situation. This is based on a baseline scenario that has been revised downwards as regards growth. As far as inflation is concerned, there is a narrowing of the ranges but no significant changes as regards the projections for inflation. However, the balance of risks has, in our judgement, changed. As regards the liquidity issue, which is a very important point, we have already decided that the full allotment fixed rate mode of liquidity supply for the one-week, one-month and three-month operations will apply in the fourth quarter. We stand ready to provide liquidity as we have done in the past, taking into account the needs of the banking sector. This supply of liquidity ensures that there is no liquidity issue for the banking sector of the euro area as a whole – in euro, by definition. When I compare the order of magnitude of the theoretical overall potential eligible collateral, which is in the order of €13 trillion, and the liquidity that is provided, which is a little over €500 billion and oscillates between €530 billion and €550 billion, clearly it is possible to obtain liquidity which is a multiple of what we are supplying. So there is no euro liquidity issue in the euro area for the banking sector at all. All the decisions we have taken in the past show the extent to which we are very keen, through these non-standard measures of full allotment at a fixed rate, to provide liquidity. What I have said is what I have said. And secondly, there is some speculation in the market at the moment coming from a note from Morgan Stanley about possible central bank action at the G7. But given that the risks are particularly intensified on the downside for the European economy, is the world economy sufficiently stressed to justify this sort of action? As regards your second question I told you what our judgement of the situation was and to what extent we had significantly changed our assessment of the situation regarding the recent developments that have been observed. As regards the Italian government we sent messages to the Italian government. I myself sent messages, together with the Governor of the Banca d’Italia, Mario Draghi. Then there was a period of some complex discussions. The last decisions of the government and the vote in the parliament, which is an ongoing procedure, confirm – which was very important for the ECB Governing Council – the first commitment of the Italian government. So we have confirmation that what was said is being implemented, in terms of overall results. And that is of extreme importance. I myself had occasions to say, including publicly in a recent dialogue with the President of the Italian Republic, before the final confirmation was made, how decisive it was that all the commitments that had been made be implemented. As I said in the introductory statement, it is essential for all governments without exception to implement what they have committed to, to be ahead of the curve and to be very determined in order to restore credibility. My second question is regarding the EFSF: how confident are you that you can stop buying government bonds once the EFSF has a capacity to intervene in the secondary market, and are the funds available big enough or are you already considering a second reform to the fund? And perhaps a third question: did the Swiss National Bank ask you for cooperation to meet its new minimum exchange target, and would you consider doing so in future? For the first question: we consider as I said, our monetary policy stance to be accommodative. We also consider that there has been a tightening of financing conditions, which is obvious in some parts of the euro area. Only in some parts of the euro area, but this is a phenomenon that we have observed and we are attentive to. Our non-standard measures – and I elaborated on the fixed rate full allotment mode which is a non-standard measure of primary importance – are there precisely to help restore a better transmission of our monetary policy stance. I would like to emphasise this, it is something which is very important. For the future, as you know, we are never pre-committed. We always do what is necessary to preserve price stability and solidly anchor inflation expectations, taking into account all elements, all parameters that are at stake. It is what we did in the past, and it is what we will continue to do. This anchoring is essential because all nominal medium and long-term rates incorporate inflation expectations, so this very solid anchoring continues to be a major asset of the euro area. The market knows that. That‘s why we have never seen either a materialisation of the risk of inflation or a threat of deflation in the eyes of the market. So that is something which is important to underline. As regards the governments and the executive branches, we expect, we are asking for, we make the working assumption – which is the only reasonable working assumption – that all the decisions taken on 21 July will be fully comprehensively and rapidly implemented. This is also what we call upon the governments to do. This includes getting the EFSF up and running and be able to intervene on the secondary market, as we have asked for. This is absolutely fundamental for us. On the Swiss issue, we have exchanged views and information with the Swiss National Bank. I have been in touch with the President of the Swiss National Bank. We discussed a number of points, but of course they took their decision under their responsibility, as we have said publicly. The central bank of Switzerland takes full and independent responsibility for its decision. But let me say that there has been a very close relationship, as always, with the Swiss National Bank. As you know, we never communicate anything but the figure for the amount of intervention on the secondary market for the purchase of securities. And I will not say anything more. But you know that on 12 August 2011 we purchased €22 billion worth of securities, followed by €14.3 billion on 19 August, €5.3 billion on 26 August, and last Monday a further €13.3 billion. This is the information that we have provided. This programme is part of our monetary policy decision and is a non-standard measure on top of the major non-standard measures I have already mentioned, the aim of which is to help restore a better transmission of the monetary policy stance. I would also like to ask about the issue of euro area expulsion, which was taken up by the Dutch Prime Minister today in the Financial Times. The German finance minister also called on Greece to do more to remain in the euro area. Do you see that sort of talk as justified and helpful? And just very quickly to come back to the Swiss case, was the Swiss intervention justified? What we have as far as new projections are concerned are the ECB staff projections. They are not the Governing Council’s projections. We take them as a very important element in the overall assessment of the situation. As always, based on the staff projections, we qualify the balance of risks. But we do not produce Governing Council projections on top of the staff projections. That is different on the other side of the Atlantic, where the forecast is signed by the Federal Open Market Committee itself. The new baseline of the staff projections has, as you said, been reduced substantially. As regards the ranges for this year and for next year, we are of the view that risks are not balanced and that we have to take into account downside risks. On top of that there is an enormous level of uncertainty; this is the main message in this domain. There is uncertainty at the global level; this is evident in the major global economies outside Europe. There is clearly also uncertainty by way of consequence, as well as for other reasons, in the euro area. Regarding your second question, our message for all governments - not since yesterday, nor the day before yesterday, but since the euro was set up - has been that they should fully respect the Stability and Growth Pact, not only individually but they should also exercise surveillance of what the other countries are doing. We were ‘preaching in the desert’ for a certain period of time and we have even had difficult discussions at some points. It was very difficult to get through the message in the major countries in Europe at a time when benign neglect was the general attitude – benign neglect by governments, by markets and by all partners. Now we are continuing and we are asking all governments to fully implement what is necessary, to fully respect all the rules and to be ahead of the curve. This is particularly valid for those who are in difficulty and for Greece in particular. But not only for Greece - it is valid for all. As regards your second question I will not comment on what will be done. I make the working assumption that the Greek government – which has received a very strong message from the IMF, from the Commission in liaison with us, and from all the governments of Europe – will do what is necessary, namely to fully, convincingly and immediately respect the commitment that has been made. This is our very firm position, and it is not a new one. As regards Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank – after due contact and after due and appropriate discussion – has taken a decision in full responsibility. This is a decision that we respect. My other question is about what you’ve just said about the Swiss National Bank. Last month, when you were asked about Japan’s intervention, you said that these interventions have to be made on the basis of multilateral consensus and a multilateral decision. Does that view hold for the Swiss decision? On the first question, I would say, again, that central banks the world over can and have to – and this is the case for all of us – ensure the solid anchoring of price stability. As you know, all inflation targeters have price stability as the goal for the central bank, because we all consider that this is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation. Not a sufficient condition, but a necessary condition. And we have to accept that we are not in a position to replace economic agents, governments, or any of the other elements of economic policy. We have a very important role, and it is particularly important in times of uncertainty and of absence of confidence, because we have to act as a pillar of stability and confidence. And this is, as you know, what the ECB’s Governing Council and the Eurosystem are permanently trying to do, what they are committed to doing. We are in a situation which is certainly very demanding. At the global level, in advanced economies in particular, but not only, we are observing very significant changes. The crisis was not a single event and localised in time. It is a phenomenon which is very far-reaching and calls for us to be alert and act as soundly as possible in these circumstances. You know that we have always said that we have a concept of permanent alertness. We are never pre-committed and we stand ready to do whatever is necessary in terms of standard measures, in terms of interest rates. Again, this is our doctrine; it’s our policy to stand ready to do whatever is necessary. And it’s also true as regards our non-standard measures. As you know, we were also the first central bank in the world to introduce these when we acted on 9 August 2007. As regards the currency situation, I do not consider that you can compare the yen, one of the major currencies of the advanced economy, to the Swiss franc. Switzerland is a relatively small economy at the heart of Europe – a brilliant economy in terms of quality, but in terms of size it’s a relatively small economy – which is surrounded by the economies of the euro area. So, I would say that we are looking at two different cases. There are no indiscreet questions, only indiscreet answers. And secondly, in your statement you’ve added this line: “A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted.” Would I be right in concluding that we are in a kind of “wait and see” mode, at least until the next scheduled monetary policy meeting in a month’s time, and that it would therefore perhaps be premature to think you might act before then? As regards the first question, as I have already said, we were unanimous in considering that interest rates should not be changed. As you might imagine, we reflected very thoroughly on the situation, on the multi-dimensional nature of the situation as regards the real economy, and as I have already said, the Governing Council changed its judgement and assessment on the qualification of the balance of risks. We also looked very carefully at the balance of risks for inflation, and again we changed our position, taking everything into account. We always consider the full complexity of the situation. As you know, we in the Governing Council mutually enlighten one another, listening very carefully to each other. We trust profoundly – I trust profoundly – in collegial wisdom. You take a decision at the end when you have heard all the assessments and judgements from all perspectives. As regards very careful monitoring of the situation, of all developments and so forth, I would say that this is, frankly speaking, our permanent approach. We constantly do that. As you know, we never embark on any unconditional promises or commitments. We stand ready to do whatever is necessary. You should not interpret that as having any kind of new concept behind it. This is the way we look at things, and if you want to see what we will do in the future in terms of the concept underlying our own decisions, you should look at the past and then you will understand. Again, we never said that we would pre-commit to being at this level for such and such a period of time or anything like that. We look at the situation, and we take our decisions accordingly. And we are alert. We are in a situation which is, of course, exceptionally demanding. Second, in terms of the overall international economic outlook now being a lot worse than when the programmes for Ireland and for other countries were actually devised, is there any argument in favour of having a less ambitious target in terms of the debt-to-GDP target in order to give the countries more of a chance to recover? With regard to the first question, there is absolutely no change to anything. As regards the second question, when I look at Ireland, I see a country that is gaining credibility regularly and the following needs to be observed: it is a country which is following its path and that has demonstrated a capacity to implement what has been decided; it is increasing its creditworthiness very visibly. We can only encourage Ireland along this path. I have nothing else to say, because improving confidence is in itself an element of growth activation that is extremely important. And so continuing in this direction is good for confidence within the country, for confidence in terms of the external perception of the country and good for growth and job creation. Given the situation of the SNB and the Swiss economy, taking into account all the elements, we understand the decision that has been taken by the central bank of Switzerland. I have nothing further to say: it was done under their responsibility and after appropriate discussion. Frankly speaking, I do not understand why this topic keeps on coming up. Our reasoning in this regard was very simple: do everything possible to improve your creditworthiness, meaning of the authorities and of the banking sector. The reasoning is as simple as that: I have nothing else to add at this stage and I have no information regarding any message which may be addressed to us. I will say the following: first, we were called to deliver price stability! We were called on by all the democracies of Europe to deliver price stability and, in particular, of course by the 17 democracies that asked us to issue the currency in their 17 countries. We have delivered price stability over the first 12-13 years of the euro! Impeccably! I would like very much to hear some congratulations for this institution, which has delivered price stability in Germany over almost 13 years at approximately 1.55% - as the yearly average of inflation - we will recalculate the figure to the second decimal. This figure is better than any ever obtained in this country over a period of 13 years in the past 50 years. So, my first remark is this: we have a mandate and we deliver on our mandate! And we deliver in a way that is not only numerically convincing, but which is better than anything achieved in the past. A second remark I would like to make is that, in the worst crisis since the Second World War, we have maintained confidence in the currency and confidence in our capacity to deliver price stability. This did not happen by chance. It happened because we decided frequently to do things that we were not recommended to do by the various governments. Our independence is inflexible. We were asked to decrease rates in 2004 by the Heads of State or Government of France and Germany, when we were at 2% and the United States was at 1%. We said no and we did not decrease rates. At the end of 2005, we increased rates when ten governments out of twelve were telling us not to do so. We also received the good advice not to do so of the IMF and of the OECD. So, it is not by chance that we have delivered price stability. If we embarked on the Securities Markets Programme for monetary policy reasons and to help restore a better transmission of our interest rate decision, it was because the governments in question, despite everything that we had said to them, did not behave properly and did not monitor things as they should have done. May I remind you that, in 2004 and 2005, some important governments in Europe were asking for a weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact? Do you remember that? And do you remember which governments were asking to weaken the Stability and Growth Pact? The three big governments of Europe, namely France, Germany and Italy! So, let me remind you that we are in the worst crisis since the Second World War. We are doing our job and it is not an easy one! The way in which our democracies are organised such that we have a living debate is excellent. I do not, of course, take part in any kind of public or political debate. We issue the currency for all of our fellow citizens, of all sensitivities, and we deliver price stability. Also, I should mention that it is the most vulnerable, the weakest and the poorest of our fellow citizens who most require us to be absolutely sure to deliver price stability. The situation is difficult, but we have taken all of our decisions in full independence and we try to live up to our responsibilities, even when these are very heavy responsibilities. We expect all other authorities to live up to their responsibilities as well. We are aware that this is not easy for any particular authority in the present circumstances. We have full respect for the difficulty involved in taking the decisions, whether these decisions are taken by governments or by parliaments, as well as full respect for the challenges posed by these times and for the fact that our fellow citizens are the masters – at the end of the day, as a fiercely independent institution, we depend on the sentiment of 332 million fellow citizens, as does any independent entity in democracies. Thank you for your excellent question, which was very stimulating! Today is the last time that there is a press conference in this room with your presence, because the next one will be in Berlin, before you leave the presidency of the ECB. A very simple question: what are your feelings today? As regards your last questions, it is not the last time. As you mentioned, I will report to the press on the position and assessment of the Governing Council in Berlin next month. So I will not speak twice, you know, like these singers or actors who say in several successive occasions “it’s my last time”. So I am saving myself for the real last time. On your first question, I would say that we discuss this particular question on the width of the band at each of our meetings. And, as you see, we have decided not to change the width of the band. We consider that it is best to leave it as it is, with plus and minus 0.75%. As regards the functioning of the market, the tensions are visible particularly in the fact that we have requests for liquidity which are above what is observed in normal times, and even sufficiently above for a lot of liquidity to go back to our deposit facility. It is clear that this exerts downward pressure on EONIA. We have observed this in the past. This is an equilibrium which is not particularly wished for by us, but it is understandable when you have this strong demand for liquidity. And again, we are providing liquidity on a full allotment fixed rate basis. Put very simply, we are not negotiating with any government. We have sent messages to tell them that the goal of restoring credibility and increasing creditworthiness, which is essential, was in our view calling for a number of orientations. It is not a negotiation, it is a message. After having had, as I said, some hesitation, complexity and so forth, what we have seen at the end of the day was something which was in line with the first commitments, even if there are some changes. We noted that and we also noted that the government had decided to go for a confidence vote. We ask all governments to fully implement what they had decided, to be ahead of the curve. It goes without saying that the goal has to be attained and if there are new decisions to take, in our view and in the view of all external observers, they would have to be taken. We also insist very much – and this is true for all governments – on the necessity to embark on structural reforms, which are the right way to elevate the ‘speed limit’ of growth in Europe. This is the key for all economies in the long run: the ability of Europeans to permit their own economic forces to be unleashed. It is absolutely essential that a number of structural impediments do not continue to exert pressure on growth in Europe. Second, you said in your introductory statement that all efforts must be undertaken to reduce deficits and debt within the euro area. However, there are numerous international institutions and economists who are fearful of a recession being around the corner and who are asking countries like Germany, whom they consider to have some room for manoeuvre, to stimulate consumption and growth with stimulus money. What is your response to those recommendations? In the euro area in particular and in Europe in general, commercial banks play a decisive role in financing the economy. In the euro area, the financing through banks amounts to perhaps 75%, with the markets making a much more modest contribution of perhaps 25%. In the United States the contribution of the markets is perhaps 75% and that of banks 25%. Therefore, since the very beginning of the crisis, we have had a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment, which is not a concept that you find in the United States or any other economy. As I have already said, it is a very important non-standard measure that we trust is very well adapted to our case. I can therefore understand that, seen from outside, from market places that have no experience of it, there might be fears, but they are unjustified. This does not mean, however, that we do not continue to call on all our financial institutions to be very attentive, in particular to retain earnings and take all possibilities to strengthen their balance sheet position. This idea that the banking sector would be short of euro liquidity is not what we are seeing and certainly is not what we are engineering, if I may. On the general remark that fiscal soundness in difficult circumstances might be counterproductive, I would say that it has to be analysed very carefully according to each particular situation. When you are in a situation where you are losing confidence because you have not behaved properly in the past, it is elementary that you have to correct that. Moreover, the correction itself, even if in certain models it produces something negative in terms of growth, would nevertheless ultimately be excellent for growth because it would improve confidence. What do you do when you want to grow, but you do not have the confidence of households, entrepreneurs or investors in the sustainability of your overall strategy? There is no contradiction between sound policies and growth and job creation. In those countries with some room for manoeuvre thanks to the resilience they have displayed in the present difficult times, it needs to be examined carefully. In my opinion, not just the euro area, but all advanced economies may have real problems if they are not reasoning in the medium to long term. Another question that is probably related to this: do you share the view that the euro area banking system is undercapitalised and that capital raising would therefore be the right measure to strengthen the confidence of investors who are funding the banks? First, I really don’t observe such a kind of stigma when I look at the access to our refinancing facility. That might have been the case in the past, but I don’t see it today. My second observation is, as I said in the introductory remarks – there is a paragraph on banks – that we consider it to be absolutely essential that banks are as solid as possible. I would underline the difference between the problem of liquidity, - which is a false problem in my opinion and I can prove it - and the fact that, all things being equal, it is better if banks have very solid balance sheets and are well capitalised. But again, this is not new for us and we have said that month after month. We have just had the stress tests, and we are sticking to the results. We will not echo any message other than our constant one, which is very strong and which the banks are well aware of. I will not dramatise the situation, as has been done by some. I do not think there is any interest in dramatising the situation on the basis of analyses that are not necessarily correct, methodologically speaking. Again, we always have to be very cautious, prudent and to look at everything. My sentiment at this stage is that the programme in your country is ongoing and that the authorities have the necessary level of determination. We encourage them, as we encourage all executive branches, to be ahead of the curve and to follow the strategic line which has been approved by the international and European authorities, in liaison with us. For Greece, it is absolutely obvious that, from a medium-term perspective, it is in the major interest of Greece, of the Greek people, and of growth and job creation to make immediately the necessary adjustment. And it is very clear that it would be an enormous mistake for the people of Greece not to make the adjustment that has only recently been committed to with the approval of the international and European authorities. And the second question: how confident are you that the “troika” will return to Greece and positively conclude its review, and can you give us an expected time frame for this? I have no response to the second question. It’s the responsibility of the IMF and the European Commission. We are in liaison with the Commission. On the first point, there is a commitment of the governments, not only to do everything to reinforce their creditworthiness individually under the surveillance of the others, there is also, as I said, a commitment to have the EFSF up and running and be able to intervene on the secondary market. These are the conditions for financial stability to be reasonably ensured in the euro area. Then, at that moment we ourselves do not have to intervene and to help restore a better transmission of our monetary policy stance. We do so only because of the present situation. Of course, the first very heavy responsibility is for those who put themselves in this situation, but there is also a responsibility for the absence of correct, ex ante surveillance. However, those responsible have to correct this and are publicly committed to doing so, which we have taken note of. It is following this public commitment that, for monetary policy reasons, we took our decision. These are bonds that are signed by the government of Spain. And I would say that anything that goes in the direction of restoring credibility is good. What has been observed seems to indicate that investors are viewing it as a serious orientation. But the encouragement I can give is to say: be ahead of the curve and implement everything as rapidly as possible. As you know, we aim for a solid anchoring of inflation expectations, which we consider a necessary condition for paving the way for growth and job creation. When we look at all available indicators of inflation expectations we see that we have indeed preserved a solid anchoring of inflation expectations. Therefore, all things being equal, we have preserved the overall financing environment, which is better than if we had an increase in inflation expectations during this extraordinarily demanding period. That is something fundamental. The current period is, at the global level, extraordinarily demanding. But, yes, we think that what we did was appropriate, again bearing in mind this idea that, if we lose the overall anchoring of inflation expectations, we are losing one of our best assets. As I said, since the beginning of the crisis, we haven’t seen any threat or materialisation of the risk of deflation. We do what is necessary to solidly anchor expectations and to deliver price stability in line with our definition. And our definition is very clear: less than 2%, but close to 2%. My second question concerns Italy. The message that you and Mr Draghi sent to the Italian government (the famous message at the beginning of August!), which was described in Italy as a “confidential letter”, has been viewed by some people, including opposition leaders, but also former EU Commissioner, Mario Monti, as putting the government into receivership. Is it true that, in this letter, you listed a series of measures that the government should take, as if you were dictating to the Italian government what it should do? On your first question, we will of course examine very closely the decision taken by the Constitutional Court. I have not yet received a fully fledged analysis of it, so I cannot comment yet on this point. More generally, though, we have always considered it, important that once a decision is taken – and it can be a very solemn decision, taken by either a government or by a parliament, depending on the various institutional frameworks in place in each of our democracies – then, there are a number of decisions to be executed, some of them very rapidly and on the basis of some kind of executive procedure, and in an effective and efficient manner. Again we have to look very carefully at the Constitutional Court’s decision. As regards Italy, as I said, these are messages: we are not dictating or imposing anything. We considered it our duty – exactly as it was our duty to tell all governments to respect the Stability and Growth Pact – to tell governments, individually and collectively, that they will be better off if they have better governance. We are on record as having launched a large number of messages. We would prefer not to launch those messages and it is not what the Treaty is calling on us to do. The Treaty calls on us to deliver price stability. So, again, we did not dictate anything. We analysed the situation and reflected on what would be important to help restore credit worthiness. In that domain we are not engaging, and never have engaged, in “negotiations”. "
04/08/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged, following the 25 basis point increase on 7 July 2011. The information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. While the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. As expected, recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months, following the strong growth rate in the first quarter. Continued moderate expansion is expected in the period ahead. However, uncertainty is particularly high. For monetary policy, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. At the same time, short-term interest rates remain low and financing conditions are favourable. Thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Given the renewed tensions in some financial markets in the euro area, the Governing Council today also decided to conduct a liquidity-providing supplementary longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO) with a maturity of approximately six months. The operation will be conducted as a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment. The rate in this operation will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations (MROs) over the life of the supplementary LTRO. The operation will be announced on 9 August 2011, with allotment on 10 August 2011 and settlement on 11 August 2011, and will mature on 1 March 2012. The Governing Council also decided to continue conducting its MROs as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last maintenance period of 2011 on 17 January 2012. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the last quarter of 2011. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided to conduct the three-month LTROs to be allotted on 26 October, 30 November and 21 December 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the first quarter of 2011 euro area real GDP posted a strong quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8%. Data and survey releases for the second quarter point towards ongoing real GDP growth, albeit, as expected, at a slower pace. This moderation also reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was in part due to special factors. The underlying positive momentum of economic growth in the euro area remains in place and continued moderate expansion is expected in the period ahead. Euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. In addition, the present level of consumer and business confidence in the euro area supports private sector domestic demand. However, growth dynamics are currently weakened by a number of factors contributing to uncertainty, and activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various regions and sectors. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook for the euro area remain broadly balanced in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. On the one hand, consumer and business confidence, together with improvements in labour market conditions, could continue to provide support to domestic economic activity. On the other hand, downside risks may have intensified. They relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the euro area financial markets as well as to global developments, and the potential for these pressures to spill over into the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in July 2011, following 2.7% in June. The relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and other commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and other commodity prices, is also still discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It remains of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices. Furthermore, there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, upside risks may stem from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 2.1% in June 2011, from 2.5% in May. Looking through the recent monthly volatility, M3 growth has broadly stabilised over recent months, after edging up until the first quarter of 2011. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector declined to 2.5% in June, from 2.7% in May. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample, and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 remained unchanged at 1.2%, whereas growth in other short-term deposits declined to 3.7%. The growth differentials continue to reflect in part the gradual increase in the remuneration of short-term time and savings deposits over recent months. At the same time, the still relatively steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. However, this impact is likely to be waning. On the counterpart side, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations continued to edge up, from 0.9% in May to 1.5% in June, whereas the annual growth of loans to households hovered over recent months around rates of slightly above 3%. The overall size of MFI balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months. Where it is necessary to provide adequate scope to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. In this respect, we welcome the EU-wide stress-testing exercise, which was prepared by the European Banking Authority and national supervisors, in close cooperation with the ECB. We also welcome the commitment made by national authorities with regard to the provision of support facilities for banks where private sector means are insufficient. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged, following the 25 basis point increase on 7 July 2011. The information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. A cross-check with the signals coming from the monetary analysis indicates that while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. As expected, recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months, following the strong growth rate in the first quarter. Continued moderate expansion is expected in the period ahead. However, uncertainty is particularly high. For monetary policy, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. At the same time, short-term interest rates remain low and financing conditions favourable. Thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Turning to fiscal policies, the Governing Council stresses the need for strict and timely implementation of the IMF/EU adjustment programmes in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. In addition, it underlines the importance of the renewed commitment of all Heads of State or Government of the euro area to adhere strictly to the agreed fiscal targets. For several countries, this requires announcing and implementing additional and more frontloaded fiscal adjustment measures. Those that enjoy better than expected economic and fiscal developments should make full use of this room for manoeuvre for faster deficit and debt reduction. The common aim should be to put public debt ratios and public finances on a sustainable path as soon as possible. As emphasised by the Heads of State or Government of the euro area, the inflexible determination of all euro area countries to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature is a decisive element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council also welcomes the renewed commitment of all Member States to improve competitiveness and address macroeconomic imbalances. Indeed, substantial and comprehensive structural reforms need to be implemented in the countries of the euro area in order to increase the flexibility of their economies and their longer-term growth potential. The removal of labour market rigidities and the implementation of measures which enhance wage flexibility, notably the elimination of automatic wage indexation clauses, are of key importance. We are now at your disposal for questions. And secondly, have you got any plans to re-enter into the bond purchasing programme? So far, you have said that it is dormant, it is not dead. But we have not seen the ECB back in the market recently and, if not, why not? First of all, on the non-standard measures that I have mentioned, you will have a separate press release, as usual at 3:30 p.m., at the end of this press conference, which will give you the details of the measures we have announced, namely the prolongation for the fourth quarter of what we had decided for previous quarters, with the same concept, and a special longer-term, refinancing operation with a maturity of a little bit more than six months, as I have already indicated. We trust that this is appropriate in the present circumstances to make sure that we are up to ensuring a more normal functioning of markets. And we believe and have come to the assessment that, given the renewed tensions that we are observing in some financial markets, it was the right and appropriate response. There is nothing new there. All this, as you know, has been done in the past. So, the new decision of today is that we are prolonging measures for one quarter, for one additional quarter, and we have one six-month operation. On the SMP, I myself have never said that it was dormant. I have always said that we are totally transparent on what we have been doing and – as you yourself have said – when appropriate, on the next Monday we would say what we had done in the previous days. So, I will leave it at that. It is an ongoing programme and you know and see that we are transparent. I have what I said at the press conference I gave in Brussels on 21 July, namely that there have been a number of non-standard measures, including the SMP. And all the non-standard measures – without any exception, as you know – are totally independent of our standard measures. The separation principle is absolutely key in the eyes of the Governing Council: standard measures designed to deliver price stability in the medium term, in line with our definition, and non-standard measures – when necessary and always commensurate with the degree of abnormal functioning of markets, or segments of markets – in order to help restore a more appropriate monetary policy transmission. The second is: given the current rise in yields on Spanish and Italian bonds since the EU Summit on 21 July, do you think that the right instruments are in place to stop contagion in the eurozone? And my third question relates to your remarks on the economic outlook: you emphasised particularly high uncertainty, so does slowing in global growth and also in euro area inflation lessen the need for further interest rate hikes? On interest rate policy, you know that we are never pre-committed, and that we always decide on the basis of, what we judge to be appropriate for delivering price stability in the medium term, in line with our definition. On the real economy, I had said for quite some time that the first quarter was really exceptionally buoyant and that we were expecting a progressive slowing-down. In my understanding, we will observe this slowing down in the second quarter, once we have the figures for the second quarter. And we will see what happens in the third quarter. It is true that we are going through a period of a high level of uncertainty, not only in the euro area, but at the global level. And, again, what I would say at the present moment is that, before making a further judgement, we should wait for the next meeting at which we will have the next projections and will see exactly where we stand, taking into account the new information that has come in. For the second quarter, all the information I have confirms ongoing growth, less buoyant than the first quarter. That being said, it will be a quarter with, I would say, significant growth. But, as I have said, there is uncertainty at the European and euro area level, and there is also uncertainty at the level of the world economy. As regards the SMP, again, the SMP is fully transparent, so that you will see what we do, and we publish what we have done. I have never said that the SMP had been cancelled. I have never said that and, again, you will see what we do. We discuss the SMP at every monetary policy meeting. We always discuss the SMP in these meetings. Again, you will see what we have done; it is as simple as that. As regards the right instruments, what is absolutely key for the ECB’s Governing Council is that we are responsible, as I always say, for delivering price stability to now 332 million fellow citizens. We have done that in the past, and it is our own fundamental primary mandate. The democracies of Europe have given us that mandate – we are sticking to that mandate. The governments have their own responsibilities which are very numerous. They are responsible for their individual policies in all areas of policy that do not belong to the monetary policy domain. These policies include structural reforms, fiscal policies, the control of costs in general in the economy, decisions on their own public sector and so forth. And they also, collectively, have the immense responsibility of overseeing, and exerting appropriate controls over, the policies of each and every country – you know our message in this respect. I have to say that we have looked very carefully at what was decided at the last meeting of the Heads of State or Government. We have considered a number of decisions that were taken there, and we trust that what has been signed off by 17 Heads of State or Government will be honoured fully, rapidly and effectively. This is the working assumption of the ECB’s Governing Council in terms of guaranteeing stability, the financial stability, which is a responsibility of governments of the euro area. A number of decisions have been taken that are very important. I had mentioned those decisions in real time in Brussels immediately after the meeting. Of particular importance are the commitments undertaken, and I have mentioned that in the introductory statement: delivering on their fiscal policy, the improvement of governance and of the surveillance of various countries, the re-affirmation that they will all honour their signatures and the flexibility that they have decided upon regarding the EFSF and the ESM, given the various areas where they have decided to create additional capacity, including interventions on the secondary market through the EFSF which should, in our view, become operational as soon as possible. Secondly, can you explain how you see the ECB working in future with the European Financial Stability Facility? Actions on the secondary market will be based on an analysis by the ECB. Can you explain to us how that’s going to work in practice? Are you going to be giving directions to the EFSF and is it going to be taking over some of the roles you’ve been playing recently? And my third question, I just wonder if you could tell us how you understand what’s been happening in the financial markets in the last day or two. We saw a massive increase in the use of your deposit facility and today we have this response with the LTRO sixth-month and so on. Have you been seeing real serious funding problems from euro zone banks in the last 24, 48 hours? As regards the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government, as I said, we expect all these decisions to be executed, implemented fully, in all their dimensions and in a very effective and rapid fashion. That’s the working assumption of the Governing Council, which trusts the signature of the 17 heads. Voluntary private sector involvement in Greece is part of this decision, so when I say everything has to be implemented this part of the decision is included. As regards the EFSF, it is a decision which I have accepted on behalf of the Governing Council that when the EFSF intervenes in a secondary market, it would be on the basis of an ECB analysis recognising the existence of exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability. So that’s clear. We have accepted that. It is something which we consider acceptable for us. Of course, what we expect is that the EFSF, which will have the capacity to intervene in the secondary markets, will be effective and efficient in its interventions. That would permit us not to have to intervene to help restore more appropriate monetary policy transmission. As regard the financial markets, I would say that we have observed not only in the last half days, but over the last days this kind of liquidity issue, which combines a high level of liquidity with the absence of smooth market functioning. This is the mark of periods of tensions. It is the reason why we have taken the decisions that I just mentioned. My second question is, the ECB is still warning about upside risks to inflation in its increased interest rates in the last few months. Other central banks, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank have taken easing steps in the last few days. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are expected to keep rates very low for a very long time. Is the ECB out of sync with other major central banks when it comes to its assessment of risks to the economy and inflation? On the first question, again, we are fully transparent. You will see what happens. I would not be surprised if, before the end of this press conference, you would see something in the market. Don’t exclude that. But no other comment. As regards monetary policy, we are taking our standard measures exactly as I always say: we do what we judge necessary to be sure that we deliver price stability. We consider it extremely important to continue anchoring inflation expectations correctly. We consider it is very important for confidence, for stability in the euro area, confidence in the largest sense of the term, confidence of households, confidence of entrepreneurs and the economic agents and of course for the long-term financial environment and medium and long-term market interest rates. It’s very important in all respects in our opinion and, again, we do what we judge appropriate. Other central banks are placed in different environments, in different circumstances. I can see clearly that our Swiss colleagues, for instance, are not in our situation. And I never comment on policies that are pursued by other central banks. But one can see that not all central banks are in the same situation from this inflationary perspective and risk standpoint. Again, as far as we are concerned, you know, we have only one needle in our compass, it’s very clear and it is disconnected from the non-standard measures. I commented in advance it seems to me. They will not be confirmed necessarily next Monday because there is the settlement date. You have mentioned the relationship between the EFSF and the ECB, with the ECB giving recommendations on bond buying. Could you give us some more details on that, whether these purchases will have the same objective as the SMP’s purchases, and will they have the same guidelines? And a final question if I may, the recent issue in the US, with its debt problems – has it possibly tarnished the image of the dollar as a global reserve currency, do you think? First of all, on the SMP, it is a Eurosystem programme, so the purchases are on the balance sheets of the various members of the Eurosystem. We play a modest part at the ECB in this overall operation, but it takes place across the members of the Eurosystem team. There is nothing new there; this is the way it functions. As regards the EFSF, it has been decided by the Heads of State and Government that it could intervene in the secondary markets on the basis of our ECB analysis, recognising the existence of exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability. That would be our contribution and I think it is extremely important. It is something that we had explicitly asked the various governments of Europe to do as part of the reinforcement of their own weaponry for the sake of the financial stability in the euro area as a whole. As regards the US dollar, I have no other comment than the usual comment, according to which - to take the words of the US authorities - a dollar which is credible and strong vis-à-vis the other major floating currencies is good for the US and for the rest of the world. I do not depart from that remark. Secondly, were the decisions of the Heads of State and Government last month the “quantum leap” you often ask for in the economic governance of the euro zone? Thirdly, we are now seeing all central banks giving more liquidity in the market; do you think that a new flood of liquidity in the world will solve all the problems or what more has to be done? As regards your first question I would say that the decision we took on monetary policy was unanimous. As regards the “quantum leap”, you know that we had asked for a very important improvement in the surveillance not only of the fiscal policies but also of all the other economic policies, including the competitiveness indicators and the imbalances. We will have those two pillars for surveillance now, and what I understand from what was said by the Heads (at least those who were there) is that they will rapidly finalise their negotiations with the European Parliament in the “trialogue”. The “trialogue” is necessary to agree upon the secondary legislation, because you need several “keys” for that and in particular that of the Parliament. We have publicly said that we thought the governments were not going sufficiently far in the reinforcement of surveillance as regards the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact. I understand it is now their intention to go further in that direction. Of course, it has to be implemented in this “trialogue”. That is something that the Governing Council would consider positively. That being said, it is clear that we have the letter of the governance that we have today, we have the spirit of the governance that we have today, and we have governance tomorrow and perhaps the day after tomorrow. It is a process. We consider that strong, rigorous surveillance is essential particularly in a single currency area. It is absolutely of the essence. That has always been our line. We were very alarmed by the attitude of some governments at a certain moment, particularly in 2004 and 2005. Now we have the benefit of seeing what has happened since then. With the benefit of hindsight, everybody sees that it is absolutely necessary. To answer your third questions we will not contribute to the flow of liquidity. As regards the SMP, as you know, we are always withdrawing the liquidity which is injected, so that we do not embark through that means in any quantitative easing. That is a concept that we have been applying since the very beginning and, again, I do not want to comment on the policies that are pursued by other central banks. In any case, I would certainly share the view that when you do anything, you have to look at the short-term, the medium-term and the long-term. If for a short-term benefit you are putting into question the medium- and long-term goals, you are not doing a good thing. And this is so visible in the fiscal area that I do not have to insist, but it is true in all areas. This is the reason why we are strictly separating standard measures and non-standard measures, and perhaps why we appear as taking different measures from others. But it is, for us, fundamental. First of all, it goes without saying that the governments have to do their job. This is absolutely fundamental. So, again, we have the commitments made by the governments. We are following what they are doing. A number of them are subject to fully fledged IMF and European Union programmes, but we consider all the governance that exists to be absolutely fundamental and would like to reiterate this. It all depends on the governments being ahead of the curve, full stop. Second, the SMP: don’t expect me to say anything more than what I have said before. Since the very beginning of the SMP, I have never said anything, except that, if we intervene, we intervene. You will see what we will have done, and we will publish this information. I will not say any more on that. Let me just say that, as with all the other non-standard measures on the covered bond programme and what we have done before and are doing today as regards the refinancing on the basis of full allotment and at a fixed rate, everything is driven by the consideration of the fact that we are the central bank for 17 countries and that we have to observe monetary policy transmission in this very vast area, which is the size of the United States of America. All we are doing in this domain is helping to restore better monetary policy transmission, obviously in exceptionally difficult circumstances. Again, by far the first in a sequence of actions and the key for everything is for governments to be ahead of the curve in both their fiscal policies and their structural reforms. Structural reforms are absolutely of the essence. I know that, here and there, they are difficult. They might be politically difficult in our democracies. But they are paying off, and I have already given the example of those countries in the euro area that have been remarkably bold in terms of structural reforms, cost control and fiscal policies, and that are rewarded in such a brilliant fashion that they are, in our opinion, a role model for others. I do not want to go into too much detail because I spoke about that a year ago, as you may recall. There is nothing new. When the markets themselves do not reflect our monetary policy, then the monetary policy transmission mechanism does not function optimally. Secondly, I was wondering, given the rising global uncertainty and market turmoil, has there been any talk or is there any scope for some sort of coordinated global action to address either of those issues? We always have a very close relationship with our sister institutions everywhere in the world, in the industrialised world as well as in the emerging world. And that is an ongoing process. I think that the degree of mutual confidence is extremely important in this domain. As regards the overall situation in the countries that have to put their fiscal house in order, taking into account the confidence channel it is absolutely clear that it is certainly not in pursuing further fiscal deterioration that any growth will be gained. It will only deteriorate further the confidence of economic agents. That is absolutely obvious. It was perhaps more difficult to explain at a time when you did not see the confidence channel functioning. But when you see precisely how it operates, there is a clear demonstration that it is very important to embark on putting your house in order and implementing wise policies. As the point was made in the Governing Council’s Introductory Statement, having the appropriate structural reforms is also absolutely critical. Structural reforms enable more people to find work and permit more potential growth, and this is decisive. We have a very strong twofold message: the need for fiscal policies that are ahead of the curve – namely the need for adjustment – and the need for structural reforms. We believe that all countries must always be ahead of the curve. And this is of course true for Italy as well as for all other countries. Particularly in the case of Italy, structural reforms appear to be very important, in addition to the absolutely necessary frontloading of the structural measures. But when the rate of growth is viewed over a sufficient period of time it is clear that the medium to long-term rate of growth does not correspond to the growth potential of a country where the human resources are so good and where the entrepreneurial spirit is so obvious in small and medium-sized enterprises and the fact that the Italian economy is hampered by structural impediments is absolutely obvious. Again, this is true for Italy and it is also true for many other countries. It is urgent for absolutely all countries and for Italy of course. Second, the recent agreement on debt by the government of the United States presents an innovation in terms of governance by appointing a special committee which will decide on fiscal policy – that’s taking fiscal policy away from constituency pressure. Do you think this is a welcome step by the United States in terms of helping global governance? On the first point, I have no information on that and I consider it would be a very extraordinary, bad decision. But I have absolutely no information and it seems to me absurd to be frank. As regards the United States, of course I am happy that a solution has been found, and I had no doubt that a solution would be found. But all this underlines the fact that all advanced economies have their own problems, apart from a very few that had problems at the beginning of the nineties – I am thinking particularly of Canada and Sweden. Those that had experienced problems had drawn lessons from that experience and had protected themselves from the difficulties. But Japan, the United States and other large industrialized economies have very big problems. We were all practising benign neglect in the past and the advanced economies have to correct their own trajectories. It is not the problem of the euro area in particular – the paradox being that the euro area as a whole is better off in terms of public finance and the yearly deficit than the United States, Japan and other large advanced economies. The problem is that some countries in Europe did not behave properly, even though Europe as a whole is in a better situation than others. And that is the reason why we are so insistent on governance. I have said that I have no further comments to add. Second, a lot of German politicians worry that the EFSF could give credits to countries without any clear conditions that the countries have to fulfil. Could you give us your view of in which circumstances the EFSF could give credits to other countries? Is it similar to the flexible credit line of the IMF? I can do nothing but read again the decisions of the Heads of State or Government. And there are two key criteria for the Heads of State or Government. One is our own analysis, recognising the existence of exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability. And the second is on the basis of a decision by mutual agreement of the EFSF member countries. Of course, they themselves decide on the basis of their own key criteria. We have key criteria and they have key criteria. And it goes without saying that they will make up their minds on what is appropriate and what is not. On your first question, let me be very precise: we were unanimous in our decision on the standard monetary policy measure. We were unanimous on the overall full allotment with a fixed rate and all the decisions that will be published in just a few minutes. We were not unanimous but had an overwhelming majority in our decision on the operation regarding the bond purchase. Usually, on this particular element, the Governing Council has an overwhelming majority. So there is nothing new. The Governing Council is the decision-maker. In all governing councils in charge of monetary policy that I know of, I know that from time to time they have a decision by a majority. And we ourselves, according to our own rules, take our decisions by majority voting, as is the case in all other monetary policy councils or open market committees that I know of. And in our case, we have the Governing Council and we consider that it is the Governing Council which is pertinent. And then, secondly, do you have any concerns that the latest market turmoil around Italy will have any negative impact on the programmes already in place in Ireland and other countries that have programmes? I would say that if we have an adviser, it is in order to have the appropriate advice. There is no additional interpretation. We consider that it is the right way to proceed when there is important monitoring to be done, which is the case in Ireland. That being said, I would say that all the information we have on the implementation of the adjustment programme in Ireland suggests that it is going in the right direction. That’s what I can say on the basis of what we observe at present regarding the implementation of the adjustment programme. I will only say that we have a very clear position in the Governing Council of the ECB. We consider that such interventions have to be made on the basis of a multilateral consensus and a multilateral decision. That is our position. It’s a clear-cut position that we have always had. To my knowledge what has been done is not part of a multilateral decision. I have no particular information on any letter. I have not seen the letter so I can only comment once I have seen it. At this stage, what I am asking on behalf of the Governing Council is that all the decisions that have been taken and published in Brussels are implemented fully and rapidly. This is of the essence. We are never pre-committed. It is a part of our own rules as you know, and forms part of our own doctrine and concept. That being said, the working assumption is that the decision that has been taken is implemented fully and rapidly, and it goes without saying that if it is implemented fully and rapidly, it would eliminate the reason why we, from time to time, intervene on the bond market through the non-standard measures that I already explained. That is our working assumption. It is clear that the entire world is intertwined and that there are interdependencies that form part of the overall global financial markets and the global economy. So what happens in the United States has an influence on the rest of the world. That is absolutely obvious and was seen by all observers, no doubt about that. "
07/07/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after raising rates by 25 basis points in April 2011 from historically low levels. The further adjustment of the current accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. The underlying pace of monetary expansion is continuing to gradually recover, while monetary liquidity remains ample with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. Thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity and job creation. As expected, recent economic data indicate some deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the second quarter of 2011. While the underlying momentum of economic growth in the euro area continues to be positive, uncertainty remains elevated. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the first quarter of 2011 euro area real GDP posted a strong quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8%, following the 0.3% increase in the last quarter of 2010. Recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued expansion of economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of this year, albeit at a slower pace. This moderation reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was in part due to special factors. The positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains in place. Euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the present level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should contribute to economic growth. However, activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, favourable business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected and higher foreign demand could also contribute more strongly to growth than expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.7% in June 2011 according to Eurostat’s flash estimate – the same rate as in May. The relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also still discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It remains of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices. Furthermore, there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, upside risks may stem from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 2.4% in May 2011, from 2.0% in April. Looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth owing to special factors, M3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector continued to strengthen slightly, rising to 2.7% in May after 2.6% in April. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion has continued its gradual recovery. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 moderated further in May, whereas growth in other short-term deposits increased. These developments reflect in part the gradual increase in the remuneration of short-term time and savings deposits over recent months. At the same time, the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. However, recent information suggests that this impact may be waning. On the counterpart side, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations and to households remained unchanged from April at 0.9% and 3.4% respectively, confirming the pattern of developments in previous months. The overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after raising rates by 25 basis points in April 2011 from historically low levels. The further adjustment of the current accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is continuing to gradually recover, while monetary liquidity remains ample with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. Thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity and job creation. As expected, recent economic data indicate some deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the second quarter of 2011. While the underlying momentum of economic growth in the euro area continues to be positive, uncertainty remains elevated. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Turning to fiscal policies, the current environment is very demanding and requires decisive action. Euro area countries must, as a minimum, comply with their fiscal consolidation commitments for 2011 and beyond, as foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures. Adequate and more frontloaded adjustment should ensure that structural fiscal consolidation targets are met, in line with the ECOFIN Council recommendations, and any better than expected economic and fiscal developments should be exploited to achieve faster deficit reduction. The announcement of fully specified consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond is essential to convince the general public and financial market participants that the corrective policies will be sustained and that public debt developments will be put on a sustainable path. At the same time, it remains essential that substantial and comprehensive structural reforms are urgently implemented in the euro area to strengthen competitiveness, flexibility and longer-term growth potential. This is particularly relevant for countries with high fiscal and external deficits or with past losses in competitiveness. We welcome the introduction of the European Semester, including the recent submission of countries’ National Reform Programmes that incorporate commitments made under the Euro Plus Pact. We also support the European Council conclusions calling for more ambitious and well-defined reforms that should be frontloaded in order to foster competitiveness. In addition, the removal of labour market rigidities would strongly support the adjustment process. Measures which enhance wage flexibility, such as the elimination of automatic wage indexation, would help to accomplish the necessary adjustment. We are now at your disposal for questions. And my second question is: when you suspended collateral requirements for Ireland and Greece earlier, you said that you would rely on your own judgement in deciding on the quality of collateral. Now you are saying that you cannot accept ones that have defaulted, that have been rated defaulted by rating agencies. So my question is: what has happened to your own judgement? First, I would say that, as you know, we have not published the projected central inflation rate of the range, but the full range. So, I will not deny that the centre of the range is very close to the figure you have given. But again, we publish ranges and these ranges allow us to capture existing uncertainty much better, taking into account all the parameters that have an influence on the consumer price index. All that being said the staff projections were incorporating increases in interest rates. So, you should not deduce from the fact that our projections were below but close to 2% in the medium term, at least in this horizon, that we do not need to increase rates simply because such increases, as anticipated by the markets, were incorporated in this projection. I would confirm that we have taken an important decision today. I have explained why we took it. We always do what the Governing Council judges to be necessary to deliver price stability and to solidly anchor inflation expectations. The latter is of fundamental importance precisely for the delivery of price stability and also for providing the European economy with a sound anchor in terms of both price stability and confidence. We have no pre-commitments, and you will see what we will do when the time comes. I have no further comment on future decisions. They will be taken, as always, as were the two last decisions, at the moment that is appropriate, in our view, to deliver price stability over the medium term. There is nothing to add to what I have said. Market expectations are changing with our own decisions. Market expectations were not incorporating any interest rate increase for this year until we said, in March, that we were likely to increase rates one month later, namely in April. And then you could all see market expectations sharply changing, as this is normal on the basis of the information given by the Governing Council of the ECB. On your second question, let me only tell you that today the Governing Council has decided the following on which you will be getting a press release at 3.30 p.m. immediately after the press conference. We have decided to suspend the application of the minimum credit rating threshold in the collateral eligibility requirements for the purpose of Eurosystem credit operations in the case of marketable debt instruments guaranteed by the Portuguese government. This suspension will be maintained until further notice. And we took that decision, taking into account the fact that the Portuguese Government has approved an economic and functional adjustment programme which has been negotiated with the European Commission, in liaison with us and the International Monetary Fund. The Governing Council has assessed the programme and considers it appropriate. Now let me turn to the last point you mentioned, implicitly or explicitly. Indeed, the position of the Governing Council is that we say “No” to a selective default or a credit event. I have no further comment on this, apart from that we say “no” to selective default. The position of the Governing Council has not changed at all, and as far as I am aware, the position of Eurogroup has not changed either. A selective default is associated with this issue of private sector involvement, which was not taken into account when we waived the threshold requirement for Portugal today. Our position is clear: in the case of Portugal, we are waiving the threshold requirement and in the case of Greece, in relation to which the debate on the nature of private sector involvement is ongoing, we say “no” to selective default. It is the full responsibility of the governments and the members of the Eurogroup to discuss with private creditors. It is our responsibility to deliver price stability for the 331 million citizens of the euro area, which we did, are doing, and will continue to do, with great determination. In the present circumstances, we call upon all authorities to fulfil their responsibilities, each of them in their own sphere of responsibility. And secondly, given the nature of bank lending, it seems that interest rate changes tend to filter through more quickly in the periphery. Are you doing more damage to the periphery with these rate increases? On the first question, I would say that we have clearly indicated our position on private sector involvement. We have said publicly since the concept was first floated that we ask governments to stick to the international doctrine, to the IMF doctrine, to the doctrine applied recently in Asia, for instance, where we had the last crisis only a few years ago. We are constantly transmitting this message to governments. And again, we do not want to – and cannot – take on the responsibilities of the various authorities concerned. So, we are giving our own advice to governments as clearly as possible on the subject of private sector involvement, namely: “Don’t depart from the global doctrine. If you depart from the global doctrine, you are weakening what you are aiming for – namely maintaining financial stability in Europe as a whole and in the euro area as a whole.” As regards our decision today, as I said the last time we took such a decision, we consider that maintaining stability for an entire continent, for 331 million fellow citizens, maintaining price stability and maintaining confidence is essential for the prosperity of our continent – particularly, for the 17 economies that are part of the euro area. Everyone is benefiting from the confidence and stability preserved by our own actions in line with our Treaty mandate, in line with what the people of Europe are asking of us. And the fact that we have, at the same time, difficulties in some countries such that there are significant risk premia can not in any respective make us forget that the solid foundations underlying the functioning of the euro area are precisely the stability and the confidence that we are preserving. Again, if there were any increase in inflation expectations over the medium term that increase in inflation expectations would be transmitted to all market interest rates – all market interest rates in all countries. And secondly, with Moody’s recently downgrading Portugal, do you think that contagion from Greece to other countries is now stronger? First, I would say that rigorous and strict respect for the commitments and decisions that have been negotiated, discussed and approved by the government concerned and by the international community, by the European Union, is absolutely of the essence. That being said, being ahead of the curve is always a positive, in all circumstances. You have heard me here repeating and repeating, month after month, that all countries would benefit greatly from being ahead of the curve. I have to say that, in the case of the Portuguese government, I thought that it was very good indeed that some decisions taken by the government were on top of what had been put in the programme. For instance, the privatisation goes beyond what was in the published programme. And that is something which I consider to be very positive. We also have the government’s decision – which was not in the programme – on the taxation of Christmas bonuses. I also noted – this was not a decision which went beyond what had already been decided – that 80% of the Portuguese parliament approved the adjustment programme, which is something I believe to be very important. As regards your second question, I have no particular comment to make on any recent decisions. And then, separately, on the topic of the Irish programme, our government is now saying they hope to be able to carry out next year’s budget without cutting social welfare and without increasing income tax, do you think that this is going to be possible to do? First of all it is extremely important that the programme is applied, and I shall not elaborate any more on that. Our interest rate increase is once again designed to permit us to continue to deliver price stability for Ireland and for our other fellow citizens, a total of 331 million people, and that is what we have in mind when we take such a decision. And Ireland, like all the other countries, is benefiting from the fact that we are credible in delivering price stability and we have a solid anchoring of inflation expectations. All countries, without exception, enjoy the positive, which is a solid anchoring of inflation expectations. As regards your second point, on the implementation of the programme, I have to say that the results that I see are going in the right direction. For instance, the current account of Ireland was positive last year – the latest figures we have. And that demonstrates that the adjustment is proceeding in line with what was foreseen. Secondly, could you tell us how you imagine the global doctrine as regards dealing with countries facing solvency and liquidity issues, because in the past we have had countries that have defaulted? I am not quite sure what you are saying when you say “uphold the global doctrine”. Perhaps it would be possible if you could spell out exactly what that means. And the final question is: a lot of people, particularly in Germany worry now – it is apparently now the biggest worry of Germans – about the stability of the eurozone rather than unemployment, which is what it was before. Can you give the people of the eurozone an assurance that whatever happens in Greece, even if, against your wishes, there is a selective default, the ECB will do whatever is necessary to preserve the stability of the financial system in the eurozone, even if that means for instance allowing emergency liquidity assistance in the case of Greek banks, or such measures as accepting their collateral even if the bonds have defaulted? On your first question the response is, we were unanimous. On your last question, when a country is determined to practise cost monitoring in the best fashion possible in order to regain competitiveness (and don’t forget that at the start of the euro Germany had a current account deficit and a low level of competitiveness considerably hampered by reunification), when a country is very attentive to its costs, when nominal costs and prices evolve in a sound and orderly manner over time, you obtain the ensuring benefits, and the benefits are growth, as well as diminishing unemployment and increased employment. Germany is a country which has less unemployment today than immediately before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. From time to time people ask whether sound management, low unit labour costs, adjustment and where necessary austerity are paying off? Yes, they are paying off! You can see that with your own eyes. Of course, it has required great attentiveness in the past. And attentiveness – specifically, the surveillance of other governments – is what should have been exerted in relation to other countries. And I would also say that when you run sound policies and improve competitiveness you not only have growth and jobs, but you also have resilience, which is demonstrated by the fact that the German success has taken place during the worst crisis since the Second World War, perhaps could have been the worst since the First World War. Germany is not alone in this situation, but Germany is a very good case in point. I would draw the provisional conclusion that the significant reinforcement of governance that we have been calling for – for the EU 27 and more particularly for the 17 euro area countries – is extremely important. And otherwise I would say each authority has its own responsibility: we are ourselves responsible for the euro area as a whole and for the price stability of the euro area as a whole, which is one of the preconditions for stability and confidence. We expect the other authorities, without any exception, to be up to their own responsibilities, in the case of the fiscal problems of the countries concerned. Secondly, the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) has been dormant for 14 or 15 weeks. Can we expect that this is going to continue to be the case or may there be changes? And lastly, are you happy with the central role the rating agencies have in today’s financial system? First of all, I have to go back to Mr Atkins because I did not respond to part of his question, if you permit. As regards the so-called “global doctrine”, the presumption of the international community is that if you have a particular country problem, you do what is necessary to have a very, very strong and credible conditionality which is part of the global doctrine with the adjustment programme negotiated by the IMF. Then you are financing the adjustment with a view to going back to normal creditworthiness and normal market financing as soon as possible thanks to the rigorous implementation of the adjustment programme. For instance, in the case of the last Asian countries crisis, all Asian countries that had problems, and engaged in adjustment programmes with the help of the IMF and the help of their neighbour countries, different kinds of help, came back to appropriate creditworthiness, except for Indonesia. So you have a possible exception to the rule at the global level. That is something which we had under our eyes in recent episodes that I am mentioning. What is not in the global doctrine, not at all in the global doctrine, is the idea that, as soon as, on top of the IMF loan, there is a loan supplied by a neighbouring country, you ask for restructuring, haircuts, you name it. That is not the international doctrine. Again, you cannot eliminate a failure, eliminate a drama, but you cannot presume that it is a normal situation to have this kind of private sector involvement. It’s clear, it’s what has been said repeatedly, and it’s what has been decided by the Eurogroup. I have here the Eurogroup decision which was taken, if I’m not mistaken, at the end of November, and which explicitly refers to the international doctrine. But it has to be repeated, so you gave me a good occasion to repeat it. Now I’m coming back to your own question. Could you remind me of the first one? Again, we say “no”. We don’t take the decision. Decisions are taken by governments in that particular case and by those who are negotiating and discussing. So again, we are saying “no”, but we are not the decision-makers and we do not want to take the place of the decision-makers. Every institution, every authority has to take up its responsibility. The default or selective default could be a consequence of some of the actions and then we would say: “No, it is not what we would consider appropriate in the circumstances”. Credit event or selective default or default, we say “no”, full stop. And the last question was, if you think that the importance of the rating agencies in today’s financial system is the right thing. On the SMP, I would only say that we are totally transparent. Week after week, you see what we are doing, or not doing. And you have been a good observer of what was done in the last weeks. I have no other comments. We continue to be totally transparent. I would also say that we are continuing to withdraw the liquidity that had been supplied by the SMP and that also is transparent and done every week and published every week. On the rating agencies, I think we have to reflect on it at a global level as is being done, by the way, by all authorities concerned on both sides of the Atlantic and elsewhere in the world. We reflect on that at a global level through the Financial Stability Board. It is clear that there is an element of pro-cyclicality which is embedded in the functioning of the credit rating agencies that is not optimal. That’s clear. It is also clear that a small group, a small oligopolistic structure, is not what is probably desirable at the level of global finance. And taking into account the fact that there are big advantages in having a large set of private authorities, private institutions and private participants in global finance that could challenge their views and not exert an overwhelming influence, but all that being said, I would say, it’s work in progress and it would be a little bit naïve to think that we have a clear cut solution and the solution is easy to apply. It’s complex. And finally, were a country to default and impose losses on other countries and the ECB, could it be considered a severe violation of the Treaty? On your last question, as you say, we are saying to those who have a number of decisions in their hands and who are responsible: “avoid such events”. We are saying “no” to default. As regards the position that has been taken, the position of the Governing Council today is, in a way, a response, an immediate response. And I have no comment to make on your question of an attack on the euro. I would say that these decisions, which are not that easy to take, are of course good and are a step in the right direction. We did not discuss this in the Governing Council, so that is my personal view. As I said, we are sending the message to all countries, without exception, that being ahead of the curve is good, not only in the present circumstances, but at all times, and it is rewarded by more growth and more job creation. By being ahead of the curve, I also particularly mean engaging in the structural reforms that remain the problem that Europe has. The main problem that Europe has as a whole, taking a bird’s eye view is not that we are in a worse situation than other comparable advanced economies from a public finance or current account point of view. The main problem that Europe has is too much rigidity in the functioning of its economies; insufficient flexibility. So, all structural reforms are welcome, and being ahead of the curve in structural reforms is very important because it would give much more flexibility to the European economy and therefore elevate its growth potential. Secondly, Mr Bini Smaghi was quoted by Les Echos last week saying that the ECB was working on a new funding plan for Irish, Portuguese and Greek banks. Is there anything you could tell us about that? I have to say I am being asked a lot of questions on Ireland, Portugal and, implicitly or explicitly, Greece. Can I remind you that we are responsible for the monetary policy and price stability of 330 million persons, similar to the population of the United States of America? The Governing Council is called on to take decisions with the euro area as a whole in mind. We are all experts for the euro area as a whole, according to the Treaty. And again, those issues that you are constantly addressing, which I can understand in some respects, should be addressed to governments. They, the governments, are responsible. And again, as far as we are concerned, we try to live up to our responsibilities. On your second question, I do not comment on what is said by colleagues. Otherwise, I would have to comment on 22 declarations. We are following the interaction with the banks in the three countries that have programmes very cautiously and very attentively because they are all part of the overall programme that had been negotiated. The second, related question is about the interest rate corridor. Why did you decide not to rewiden it now when you lifted interest rates? And I would like to ask about your confidence in the general economy: you sounded relatively confident that this soft patch that we are currently seeing in the economy will pass. What are your reasons for that thinking? And if I may very quickly come back to the plans for dependent banks, is your solution still being developed, or is it done and are you just waiting for the right moment to implement it? On the first question, I said we have taken the decision to increase rates by 25 basis points. In April I said that we did not decide that we would have a series of interest rate increases. This is fully in line with our own doctrine. You know that our doctrine is that we are never pre-committed, never! And we take the decision according to our judgement on the basis of facts, figures and the assessment of the Governing Council when we meet. This is true even when we say that we are in a mode of “strong vigilance”, which has significance in terms of the probability of what might happen. But, nevertheless, I always say at the same time that we are not pre-committed. So, you will see ex post what will happen. It is undeniable that we have increased rates two times since we increased rates today. As regards the corridor, we left the corridor as it was because we thought it was appropriate to leave it as it is to date, taking into account all elements. On the third point, I have, on behalf of the Governing Council, emphasised the level of uncertainty quite a lot in the last month. When we were observing very good results which were the case for the first quarter of this year, at the same time, we were saying that the second quarter would slow down quite significantly. It was clear. Today I mention again, on behalf of the Governing Council, this elevated uncertainty which is a mark of the times, and, as you remember, we were very cautious and prudent during the whole period since the start of the recovery. Uncertainty surrounds the prospects not only for European growth but also for global growth. That being said, in some respects we see the indicators as being less flattering now than they were before. We don’t conclude that we have to review our baseline projections. Our profile was exactly the profile that we are observing now, namely a very good first quarter and then a slowing-down. So what counts is that we are reasoning in the medium term for our baseline scenario. We said that, in terms of risks on the upside or on the downside; we do not see a bias; we see the risks as being balanced as regards growth for the euro area, within the context of general uncertainty. Could you repeat your last question? We already said that they are to a large extent in the countries that are under review and it is a work in progress. And my second question refers to your answer when you said that we should ask governments all our questions about Ireland, Portugal and Greece. Many commentators would argue that the ECB became a big player in this field by buying government bonds and by suspending the collateral framework. Would you say that it is a problem for your credibility if you accept more and more paper and collateral with ratings lower than investment grade? In answer to your first question, no, it is not because we fear anything. It is because we consider that the programme, which has been signed and is being upheld by the Portuguese government, is not only approved by the international community and by the European Union, but is being implemented, I would say, to some extent “ahead of the curve” as regards privatisation and taxation. All this explains the decision of the Governing Council. As regards our non-standard measures, without exception, they were taken to help our monetary policy transmission mechanism return to a more normal functioning. With regard to those who fear for our credibility, I would draw their attention to the fact that, of the big central banks of the advanced economies in the world, we are the only one that is taking a number of decisions that are not generally considered anodyne and not generally considered without any element of credibility for the central banks taking such decisions. So, I have to say that we are credible in this respect – very credible! And a central bank that, over the last 12 years has delivered average yearly inflation less than 2%, which betters the achievements of every other big central bank in Europe over the last 50 years, does not need to receive a lecture on credibility! Currently, we are calling for a “quantum leap” in governance, namely in terms of the surveillance of fiscal policies, as well as surveillance of competitive indicators and macro policies to the extent that they influence competitiveness and imbalances. We have not just said that on the occasion of the crisis, and by the way we are experiencing the worst crisis since the Second World War, we also said it before the crisis. From the very beginning of the euro, the importance of the Stability and Growth Pact has been constantly reiterated, by Wim Duisenberg and all the Members of the Governing Council, and by myself and all the current Members of the Governing Council. I have to say, however, that this has not necessarily been the sentiment of all countries, including big countries, and they were wrong. The current discussion between governments and the European Parliament on improving governance is a difficult one. We are encouraging a solution that goes as far as possible in reinforcing governance, without, because it is the rule of the game at the moment, necessitating a change to the Treaty. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, we might contemplate going further. But today is today, and today we certainly have to significantly improve our surveillance of economic policies, fiscal policies, macro policies and competitive indicators. All this is the primary responsibility of governments, not of the central bank. It is up to the various authorities concerned to live up to their responsibilities. If you have absolutely necessary corrections today, it is because decisions were taken in the past, including nominal developments were observed, there were conducive to a big loss of competitiveness and, of course, to the accumulation of deficits. All this has to be corrected in any case. It will be corrected; it will all be corrected. And this is dependent on the wisdom, determination and courage of all those who have responsibilities in this area – on it being corrected in the best fashion possible. It depends on the wisdom of those who have important decisions to take. We will, of course, follow the results of the stress tests extremely carefully. The EBA is responsible for these tests, but we have also been involved, providing some assumptions. I understand that they should be published in the second half of next week. We have called for this to be done in the best, most professional fashion possible. It is extremely important. We are waiting for the publication of these stress tests and we expect that observers and markets will trust them. We have confidence in the EBA. We have put forward a number of very clear suggestions regarding the reinforcement of governance. We have sent clear messages on governance. On eurobonds I have to say that the Governing Council did not change its thinking and is of the opinion that things should change in this domain. I have never expressed any opinion on that. It is a matter falling in the responsibility of those who are in charge. I have already said what our message for those who are in charge was, and that message was: no credit event, no selective default, no default. That is the message of the Governing Council. And the second question is: if the Greek banks take money not only from the ECB, but also from their own central bank by using emergency liquidity assistance, if the Greek bonds are downgraded to selected default and ECB cannot take them as collateral, should the Greek central bank also follow the decision and stop accepting the bonds? I am sorry because my response is very simple: our message is “no credit event, no selective default – no default!” It is as simple as that! No comment! We are not using this working assumption. We are not the actors – the governments and the authorities are the actors. We have said very clearly what our message was. I am sorry, but our time has elapsed. Next time, could we agree that we all concentrate on the first part, on our monetary policy which is much more, I would say, important than some of you suspect. And then, of course, we can address other issues. Thank you very much indeed. "
09/06/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our meeting on 5 May 2011 confirms continued upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. The underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering. Monetary liquidity remains ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. Furthermore, the most recent data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. Overall, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity. On balance, risks to the outlook for price stability are on the upside. Accordingly, strong vigilance is warranted. On the basis of our assessment, we will act in a firm and timely manner. We will do all that is needed to prevent recent price developments giving rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. We remain strongly determined to secure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and job creation in the euro area. The Governing Council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the ninth maintenance period of 2011 on 11 October 2011. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the third quarter of 2011. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted on 27 July, 31 August and 28 September 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. As stated on previous occasions, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the first quarter of 2011, the euro area recorded strong real GDP growth of 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, following the 0.3% increase of the fourth quarter of 2010. Recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued expansion of economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of this year, albeit at a slower pace. This easing reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was partly due to special factors, which will cease to play a role in the second quarter. Hence, it is appropriate to look through such short-term volatility and to emphasise the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area. Looking ahead, euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the favourable level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should contribute increasingly to economic growth, benefiting from the still accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. This assessment is also reflected in the June 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.5% and 2.3 % in 2011 and between 0.6 % and 2.8% in 2012. Compared with the March 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the range for 2011 has been revised upwards, while the range for 2012 remains broadly unchanged. The June 2011 Eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with recent forecasts by international organisations. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, favourable business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected and higher foreign demand could also contribute more strongly to growth than expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.7% in May according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.8% in April. The relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It remains of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The June 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.5% and 2.7% for 2011 and between 1.1% and 2.3% for 2012. In comparison with the March 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the range for HICP inflation in 2011 has been revised upwards, largely reflecting higher energy prices. The projection range for 2012 has narrowed somewhat. It is appropriate to recall that the staff projections are conditional on a number of purely technical assumptions, including oil prices, interest rates and exchange rates. In particular, it is assumed that oil prices will decline somewhat and that short-term interest rates will rise, in accordance with market expectations. Overall the projections embody the view that the recent high rates of inflation do not lead to broader-based inflationary pressure in the euro area. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices. Furthermore, there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, upside risks may come from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was 2.0% in April 2011, after 2.3% in March. Looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth, M3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector strengthened slightly to 2.6% in April, after 2.5% in March. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 decreased in April, while that of other short-term deposits increased. The development partly reflects the gradual increase in the remuneration of these deposits over recent months. At the same time, the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. However, available information suggests that this impact may be waning. On the counterpart side, there has been a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which rose to 1.0% in April, after 0.8% in March. The growth of loans to households was 3.4% in April, unchanged from the previous month. The latest data confirm a continued gradual strengthening in the annual growth of lending to the non-financial private sector. The overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over the past few months, notwithstanding some volatility. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our meeting on 5 May 2011 confirms continued upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering. Monetary liquidity remains ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. Furthermore, the most recent data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. Overall, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity. On balance, risks to the outlook for price stability are on the upside. Accordingly, strong vigilance is warranted. On the basis of our assessment, we will act in a firm and timely manner. We will do all that is needed to prevent recent price developments giving rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. We remain strongly determined to secure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and job creation in the euro area. Turning to fiscal policies, all parties involved in the preparation of the 2012 national budgets must ensure that they are fully in line with the requirement to support confidence in fiscal policies. A comparison between the latest economic forecasts by the European Commission and the fiscal plans embodied in the stability programmes points to the need for many countries to underpin their budget targets with concrete consolidation measures in order to correct their excessive deficits by the commonly agreed deadlines. The implementation of credible fiscal adjustment strategies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures. At the same time, the implementation of ambitious and far-reaching structural reforms is urgently required in the euro area to strengthen substantially its competitiveness, flexibility and longer-term growth potential. In particular, countries which have high fiscal and external deficits or which are suffering from a loss of competitiveness should rapidly carry out comprehensive economic reforms. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should be vigorously pursued to facilitate productivity growth. Regarding the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. We are now at your disposal for questions. And secondly, there seems to have been a bit of a verbal stand-off between the ECB and the German finance ministry over collateral, or possibly accepting collateral, or not accepting collateral. I do not necessarily want to go down that road. But how concerned are you at the ECB about the collateral you have and that, maybe, it is not quite worth as much as it was? On your first question, let me only restate that when we solidly anchor inflation expectations in the euro area as a whole, we are at the same time anchoring stability and confidence. We are permitting the market interest rates in the euro area as a whole to incorporate a lower level of inflation expectations than if we had inflation expectations going up. It is thus good for the overall financial environment of the euro area as a whole, and this is good, by definition, for all countries. So, we see several channels through which we, by taking all appropriate measures to deliver price stability and solidly anchor inflation expectations, contribute to the prosperity of all countries concerned, without any exception. Improving confidence on the one hand and preserving a favourable medium and long term environment are favourable to sustainable long-term growth and job creation. I will add that it is our primary mandate to deliver price stability and that this is a very strong request from all our fellow citizens in all countries without exception. And let me conclude by mentioning the fact that we have delivered price stability in line with our definition over the first 12 years of the euro, and that the reason why inflation expectations are solidly anchored is to be found in the fact that we have a solid track record and that we have demonstrated that we are inflexible with respect to the delivery of price stability. On the second question, we have a framework. We apply our framework and we are determined to apply our framework and our rules no matter, what happens here or there. We have a clear position in this respect. My second question is: was your decision unanimous and, if not, what were the arguments exchanged in the Governing Council? And the third one is: do you see the risk that the ongoing fiscal tensions in the euro region will impact your interest rate policy and/or the exit from your non-standard measures? As regards today’s decision on the interest rates, we were unanimous. By mentioning the Governing Council’s posture of strong vigilance, I would say that, as you already know, it means that we are in a mode where there might be an increase in rates at the next meeting, but we are never pre-committed. If we had decided to increase rates at the next meeting, I would have said so. You know well how we look at such matters. We are in a mode where we feel that it is important to express our need for strong vigilance. We will decide when we next meet, and we are not pre-committed. This, of course, holds true for the next meeting. And the absence of pre-commitment holds true over the medium term. We decide on interest rates, on our standard measures, when we judge that a decision is necessary to deliver price stability and to continue to solidly anchor inflation expectations. It is a decision that is taken by the Governing Council on the basis of all information at its disposal. We are not signalling any particular pace for the next decisions on our interest rates. As regards the standard and non-standard measures, as you can see, we are attached to their separation, to the principle of a separation between standard measures designed to deliver price stability over the medium term and non-standard measures that must, in our judgement, be commensurate with the abnormal functioning of some markets or market segments. You have heard me mention the fact that for the third quarter, we will continue with the full allotment at fixed rates in our main refinancing operations, in the one-month refinancing and the three-months refinancing operations. This is an illustration of this principle of separation. Again our policy decisions are governed by a separation between the two measures, the standard and the non-standard. And no matter what happens, we will deliver price stability, which – once again – is absolutely essential for prosperity and appropriate job creation in the medium term. Second, if the ECB, the private sector and the European finance ministers were to agree to such a voluntarily roll over, and then the rating agencies declared this to be a credit event, would that make any difference as to whether the ECB would accept these new bonds as collateral? Let me re-state our position, which I trust is very well known. First, we are not in favour of restructuring and haircuts. We exclude all concepts that are not purely voluntary or that have any element of compulsion. We call for the avoidance of any credit events and selective defaults or default. This is our position, which we have made clear for a long period of time: it is the position of the Governing Council and all governments know that position. We are not in dialogue with one particular government. Do not forget that we are the central bank for 17 countries: we issue the currency in 17 countries and have a dialogue within the Eurogroup, which is the grouping of the 17 countries. We are fiercely independent. Let me make two additional remarks: Whatever happens and it is not our decision, as this is the responsibility of the governments, we will apply our rules and our framework as regards both the soundness of our counterparties, I mean the banks, and the quality of the collateral that we take in our refinancing operations. This is crystal clear and has been communicated to governments. Second, as regards private sector involvement, I am from time to time surprised by the narrow view of private sector involvement that is generally taken in the present debate. We should not forget that private capital is also mobilised when embarking on privatisation. Privatisation is a good way of mobilising private capital and is something that we have encouraged considerably, particularly in the case of Greece. It is a very effective way of mobilising private capital and has a positive effect not only on the financing of the country, but also in terms of positive structural effects. It opens up the economy and permits it to function better. Also, foreign direct investment is a private investor involvement, which is very important in exactly the same way, because it contributes to the overall financing of the economy, is important in terms of the openness of the economy and the structural improvement of its functioning. Finally the private sector involvement that everybody would prefer would be to go back as soon as possible to spontaneous private sector market financing. All the adjustment programmes that have been set up, as well as EU and IMF conditionality, are designed precisely to accelerate a return to normal, spontaneous financing. It is valid for European cases and is the global doctrine when embarking on this kind of the adjustment programme. Again, I repeat what I said: no credit events, no selective default. We exclude all concepts that are not purely voluntarily or that have an element of compulsion. And, in saying so, I am not embarking on a dialogue with that particular minister. Do not forget that. First, all the members of the Executive Board have been appointed for eight years and, very clearly, this contract has been signed. What is more, it is laid down in the Treaty. So I will not comment on decisions that have to be taken by colleagues in full liberty and full independence, because that is the nature of the contract. As regards the speech I delivered in Aachen, let me say, on a personal basis, how moved, how touched I was to be awarded this extraordinary honour. I know what it represents historically, what it represents in Germany, and what it represents for Europe as a whole. Second, I will not repeat what I said. You will remember that I said “this is what we should do today”, and we obviously have very hard work to do today – particularly with the new legislation on governance, which is currently in the “trialogue” stage. You know that we have very strong views, and we expect that the European Parliament will permit Europe as a whole – because it’s an issue for all 27 Member States, not just the 17 euro area countries – to proceed with the quantum leap on governance that the Governing Council judges necessary. I said that we could perhaps then reflect on tomorrow, and that tomorrow would call for changes to the Treaty, that tomorrow would allow the centre to replace, in terms of decision-making in a number of domains, national governments that were in a difficult situation. And I also said that there is then the day after tomorrow. But I quoted Jean Monnet, saying “Nobody can say today what will be the institutional framework of Europe tomorrow because the future changes, which will be fostered by today’s changes, are unpredictable.” And I said myself that it would necessarily be a concept which would not apply role models, so it probably won’t be a federation as we know it; it won’t be something that we know. It would necessarily be something which will be profoundly original, because it would probably be a new type of confederation of sovereign states. Let me stop there. Again, we have a job to do today, and I believe that if we all live up to our responsibilities and have a solid sense of direction, we will succeed – as we have succeeded remarkably in our monetary union since the setting-up of the euro. And we will see what the people of Europe call for the “day after tomorrow”. It depends on the people. When the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated, you might remember that several countries were calling for simultaneous advances in terms of political union. This was the case for Germany in particular at that time. Now, again, we are dependent on our people – the people of Europe. They will decide what has to be done from a historical perspective. Today we have a lot of challenges and hard work to do, and we are encouraging ourselves to do that hard work. I did not say we would support it, I said we are excluding anything that would not be absolutely voluntary or that had any element of compulsion. I also said no credit event, no selective default. And secondly, if a voluntary rollover was agreed by governments and the private sector, but the rating agencies said it was a credit event and therefore downgraded the quality of the collateral, would you really be prepared to give the rating agencies the last word on judging the quality of your collateral? As I have said, the Governing Council excludes a credit event for manifold reasons, and not only taking into account the country in question. There are all kinds of reasons why we would exclude that. On that point I would say it is certainly not our intention. We have a new rendez-vous by definition, because we are deciding today for the third quarter, and then we will have to decide for the fourth quarter. So I can only say that we will examine the situation, taking absolutely all elements, including any new elements that would inform our decisions, into account. I never comment on markets on a day-to-day basis, first of all. Second, I trust in the fact that the market knows that we take the decisions that are appropriate to deliver price stability in the medium run. We are not pre-committed and I mentioned our strong vigilance. There is no medium-term path. And it seems to me that there is a good understanding at the moment, given the anchoring of inflation expectations. As you know, I do not comment on such statements. I would only mention that in the constellation of major floating currencies, it is very important that the US authorities – including, of course, Tim Geithner, the Secretary of the Treasury, and my colleague Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System – say, and they do say it with some force, that a strong dollar is in the interests of the United States – meaning strong vis-à-vis the other major floating currencies – and also in the interests of the global economy. And I trust that. And, secondly, you have said that you are not in an argument with a particular finance minister. However, the market perception and the perception of the public is that the ECB is at loggerheads with the German Finance Minister. Do you think that is detrimental to the perception of the euro area as a whole? On the first question, I will not add anything to what I have already said and it is certainly not our intention to participate in any kind of concept. We will examine the situation on the basis of the decisions that are taken by governments and, when decisions rest with us, the Governing Council will take the appropriate position in fierce and total independence and taking into account what would have been decided at that point in time. We will apply our own rules and nothing else, both as regards the counterparties and as regards the collateral. We are the central bank of seventeen countries and 331 million people and we cannot engage in a separate dialogue with seventeen governments and with fractions of the euro area. The Governing Council is in a position in which our discussions and our dialogue take place with the collège of the governments, and that is something which is extremely important. We have no quarrel with anyone. We have a formal dialogue with the collège of the seventeen countries within the Eurogroup and also with the collège of the twenty-seven EU Member States within the ECOFIN Council at the level of the ministers of finance. The position of the Governing Council is clear and I have reiterated it to you. You already knew what that position was, and I have no other comment. I am confident that, with due reflection and meditation, our remarks will be understood. Second, there do seem to be some signs that the global economy is slowing, for example, in the United States, and in Japan, which is very weak, interest rates remain very low. Is the ECB in a tightening mode at a time when the global economy is starting to slow, and are you maybe adding to the inevitable headwinds that might be coming from a slowing global economy by signalling more interest rate hikes? With regard to the first question, we are not designing anything ourselves: that is the responsibility of the governments. They are responsible for their fiscal policies – and, unfortunately, they do not have a brilliant record in this regard – and they have the responsibility of presenting their own decisions to parliaments, because it is the parliaments that take the decisions in democracies; it is their responsibility, not ours. As far as we are concerned, we have declared our position, namely that of the Governing Council. As regards the global economy, as I said earlier, we are in a period marked by a high level of uncertainty, and I think that we have to be fully aware of that. I would also say that there are risks on the upside, as well as risks on the downside, so after due meditation, in the assessment of the Governing Council, we see risks balanced in this respect, as regards the real economy. The staff of the Eurosystem is forecasting that overall growth this year will or may be (because we have to be very cautious) 0.3% higher than in the last assessment in the projections of the ECB staff. This increase of 0.3% more than previously foreseen, first, is not negligible at all and, second, is in line with the reviewing upward of practically all projections quarter after quarter. I have no experience of such a relatively long period during which projections were reviewed up quarter by quarter, because it started with the start of the recovery, in the third quarter of 2009. So again, we trust that when we contribute to solidly anchoring inflation expectations, we contribute to confidence and we contribute to a financial environment which is favourable overall for medium-term sustainable growth and job creation, and that is something which in any case is for us essential. By the way, when you compare our nominal interest rates today – I am not speaking of tomorrow, we will see what we decide tomorrow, as we are not pre-committed – to inflation today, I see a negative figure. Again, I will not enter into details. We are not designing anything; this is the responsibility of governments. Nevertheless, we do say that it would be an enormous mistake to embark on a decision that triggered a credit event. First, certain Irish ministers have in recent times been speculating on the possibility of a second bail-out for Ireland and also on the possibility of longer loan maturities on Ireland’s rescue loans. Given the elevated uncertainty that you referred to are they wise to be speculating in those terms publicly? Second, in your Introductory Statement you referenced labour market reforms. The Irish Enterprise Minister is advancing a plan for radical reform of Irish labour contracts, however he faces resistance within the Irish coalition. Should he proceed with his plan or should he cave in to the pressure? We have 17 countries in the euro area and we do not get involved in the policies of these 17 countries. Everything going in the direction of more flexibility and structural reforms enabling a more vibrant economy is good. In that respect Ireland has the benefit of an economy which seems to me more flexible than others. Of course, in the present circumstances in particular, everything that can go in this direction would certainly seem to be appropriate, without entering into details of the measures. In response to the rest of your question, it is good to be cautious and prudent regarding sensitive matters and I would not comment in particular on Ireland. But more generally it seems to me that verbal discipline is probably appropriate in the present circumstances and I am speaking of the euro area as a whole. Second, it is clear that the Greek plans are critical for the financial stability of the eurozone. Nonetheless, the Greek Parliament must pass those revisions to the Memorandum as a pre-condition for a new programme to be in fact even negotiated. Given the developments of the past week, that is in doubt. It cannot be taken for granted that it will not pass. If it fails, is there a Plan B being discussed? In the United States there is a Plan B being discussed vis-à-vis quantitative easing. In Congress, House Bill 1489 has called for a re-introduction of Glass-Steagall by the United States government. I do not comment on declarations by heads of states and governments, in particular the President of the United States, only to echo him when he says that a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States. It is clear that the issues at stake in Europe and in the euro area in particular are very important and have both an European dimension and a dimension of a global nature. What we see here is only part of the tensions that are being observed in the constituency of the advanced economy sovereign signature. We are experiencing tensions in the field of sovereign signature; it happens that we have, particularly in the euro area, some issues of that kind but they are certainly not only of a European nature but also of a global nature. We have to consider the very serious issues at stake within the perspective of the big picture. The big picture in Europe is slightly paradoxical because the euro area as a whole is balanced as regards its current account, which is not the case of all advanced or big advanced economies. Second, the euro area will probably post – at the end of the year – a public finance deficit in the order of magnitude of 4.5% of GDP or less, when Japan and the United States will probably be in-between 9.5% and 10%. So we are at a level which is half that of the public finance deficit of some other advanced economies. And we are proud to have maintained price stability over 12 years for the euro area as a whole in a fashion which is more convincing than over the last 50 years for the countries that are members of the euro area. So, all this is part of the big picture. I have no particular comment on Glass-Steagall. Second, in the case of a debt restructuring of Greece which the ECB does not want, it has been calculated that the potential loss for the Eurosystem would be up to 66 billion USD. I do not know whether this figure is correct. I would like you to clarify if the potential losses could be absorbed like Mr Bini Smaghi said, or like Mr Wellink said, because they have said things that are totally contradictory. Mr Bini Smaghi said that the Greek central bank would take the hit and Mr Wellink said: “No it would be spread out in the Eurosystem”. So can you tell us, which of the two is the right one? Third, if the French Socialist party asks you to be a candidate for the Presidency, what will your answer be? Thank you. The response to your last question is very easy. As regards this assumption that there could be a catastrophe, if I understand it well, and that losses could be registered and so forth, the position of the Governing Council is based on very serious reasons and general principles. We are not defending our own interests. That is not the problem. That is not what is at stake. What is at stake is to do the best for the various countries concerned, for Europe as a whole and also from a global perspective, at a global level. It is true that it is a global problem. I will not embark on any kind of assumption on “what happens if”, because I am working on the assumption that the right decisions will be taken, not the wrong. That is my assumption. Second, did you talk about possibly re-widening the rate corridor as part of this deal? Third, on the situation in the United States, how concerned are you about a possible “mini US default” as it has been termed and what impacts could it have? I have no particular comment on the decision we will take next time. You will see which decision we will take. I have mentioned in explaining today’s decision that we have decided to maintain the corridor as it is. But we will see. As regards the second question again, if and when we have something to say on the corridor, I promise, I will tell you immediately. On the United States, I am of course working on the assumption that they will have no default. That, for me, goes without saying. Second, are you concerned that slower growth elsewhere in the world will increase the interest rate differential between the eurozone and other currency areas thus putting upward pressure on the euro? On the first question, we make separate decisions regarding the standard and non-standard measures. On the non-standard measures, we considered that the present situation calls for maintaining the overall fixed rate full allotment procedure, as I have just explained. Our actions are commensurate with the kind of assessment we have on the markets’ situation and its impact on the monetary policy transmission mechanism. As regards our next decision, I will give you a rendez-vous for the fourth quarter. On the second question, I will only say again: we do everything we have to do, taking into account our own assessment of the situation and of the overall global economy and its impact on the real economy. Here, we consider that the risks are balanced, so we have approximately the same weight of the upward risks and of the downward risks. We will see what happens. And I have also said that there was a high level of uncertainty which is an important part of the picture. It is a decision which has to be taken by our partners, namely the executive authorities and also the Commission and the IMF. We call on all of them to live up to their responsibilities and to have a sense of direction in the circumstances. This is very important and I was expecting this question. At today’s meeting, we adopted an opinion on a recommendation from the Council of the European Union on the appointment of a new President of the ECB. In it, we said that Mario Draghi is a person of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary and banking matters as required by Article 283(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. So it is an opinion that we have adopted today and I have already signed the letters to the various authorities of Europe telling them that that is our position. When you are President of the ECB, you are President of an institution which issues currency for 331 million people in 17 countries. It is a very important responsibility placed on your shoulders because you have to deliver price stability to all of them as they all make up the euro area. All colleagues – and Mario has been a member of the Governing Council for a very long time – are devoted to delivering this. We have known since the very beginning that, whether in calm or stormy waters, we have to be an anchor of stability. And by being an anchor of stability, we are an anchor of confidence. It is a very strong characteristic of this institution, of all members of the institution, but particularly of the Executive Board members and the President. I believe that profoundly and it was also the case for Wim Duisenberg and our first team in the Executive Board, it is now and will be the case with Mario Draghi and the team. This is very inspiring and very important. First of all, I would say that it depends very much on the country itself. Let’s not forget that the countries concerned have the immense responsibility to cope with their own problems and demonstrate as clearly as possible to all partners and observers that the programme is working. I have to say that what I see from Ireland instils confidence in the capacity of the country to go in the right direction. And, it also depends on the overall environment and this is a consideration which is also of extreme importance. It is the reason why I mentioned that we must have a concept of private sector involvement much larger than the narrow concept which is presently being debated. "
05/05/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Helsinki. I would like to thank Governor Liikanen for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of the meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged following the 25-basis point increase on 7 April 2011. The information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the very accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted. We continue to see upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. While the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. Furthermore, recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, with uncertainty continuing to be elevated. All in all, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. With interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remaining low and the monetary policy stance still accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Maintaining price stability over the medium term is our guiding principle, which we apply when assessing new information, forming our judgements and deciding on any further adjustment of the accommodative stance of monetary policy. As stated on previous occasions, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will also be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area during the first quarter of 2011 and at the beginning of the second quarter. Looking ahead, euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should contribute increasingly to economic growth, benefiting from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, particularly in view of ongoing geopolitical tensions in North Africa and the Middle East, and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. Finally, there are still potential risks stemming from the economic impact on the euro area and elsewhere of the natural and nuclear disasters in Japan. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.8% in April according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.7% in March. The increase in inflation rates during the first four months of 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It is of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices, not least on account of the ongoing political tensions in North Africa and the Middle East. More generally, strong economic growth in emerging markets, supported by ample liquidity at the global level, may further fuel commodity price rises. Moreover, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 2.3% in March 2011, from 2.1% in February. Looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth caused by special factors, M3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remained broadly unchanged at 2.5% in March, after 2.6% in February. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually picking up, but it remains moderate. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 remained broadly unchanged in March, while that of other short-term deposits increased. The development partly reflects the gradual increase in the remuneration of these deposits over recent months. At the same time, the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. On the counterpart side, there has been a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which rose to 0.8% in March, after 0.6% in February. The growth of loans to households was 3.4% in March, compared with 3.0% in February. Looking through short-term volatility, the latest data confirm a continued gradual strengthening in the annual growth of lending to the non-financial private sector. The overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over the past few months, notwithstanding some volatility. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged following the 25-basis point increase on 7 April 2011. The information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the very accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted. We continue to see upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. A cross-check with the signals coming from our monetary analysis indicates that, while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. Furthermore, recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, with uncertainty continuing to be elevated. All in all, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. With interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remaining low and the monetary policy stance still accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Maintaining price stability over the medium term is our guiding principle, which we apply when assessing new information, forming our judgements and deciding on any further adjustment of the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Turning to fiscal policies, current information points to uneven developments in countries’ adherence to the agreed fiscal consolidation plans. There is a risk that, in some countries, fiscal balances may fall behind the targets agreed by the ECOFIN Council for the necessary and timely correction of excessive deficits. It is essential that all governments meet the fiscal balance targets for 2011 that they have announced. Where necessary, additional corrective measures must be implemented swiftly to ensure progress in achieving fiscal sustainability. The implementation of credible policies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures. At the same time, it is of the utmost importance that substantial and far-reaching structural reforms be implemented urgently in the euro area in order to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness and flexibility. In particular, countries which have high fiscal and external deficits or which are suffering from a loss of competitiveness should embark on comprehensive economic reforms. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be further pursued to speed up restructuring and to bring about improvements in productivity. Regarding the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. The Governing Council, in line with the ECB’s opinion of 17 February 2011 on the six legislative proposals on economic governance, urges the ECOFIN Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission to agree, in the context of their “trialogue”, on more stringent requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness. Finally, the Governing Council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was agreed by the Portuguese government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund. The programme contains the necessary elements to bring about a sustainable stabilisation of the Portuguese economy. It addresses in a decisive manner the economic and financial causes underlying current market concerns and will thereby contribute to restoring confidence and safeguarding financial stability in the euro area. The Governing Council welcomes the commitment of the Portuguese public authorities to take all the necessary measures to achieve the objectives of the programme. It considers very important the broad political support for the adjustment programme, which enhances the overall credibility of the programme. We are now at your disposal for questions. Second, what did the Survey of Professional Forecasters show in terms of inflation and growth expectations? Third, are you concerned that the EONIA overnight rate shot up after you raised rates last month, effectively tightening monetary policy or monetary conditions even further? In response to your first question, yes – we were unanimous. With regard to your second question, we will publish the Survey of Professional Forecasters later on. But let me tell you what we have borne in mind, namely that medium-term and longer-term inflation expectations are anchored in line with our definition of price stability, which means that we continue to have a solid anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium long-term. I expect that we will see that this is in line with the forecasts by all observers and international institutions for the long-term. In the short-term everybody expects the push upward in inflation, which is due to the rise in oil prices. As far as the EONIA is concerned, we are looking very carefully at what is going on. I have to say that it is not surprising that the decision we took in April was reflected in the EONIA. Let me say with prudence and caution that it is up to the market to function, and the EONIA is the result of market functioning. However, it seems to me that the volatility that we observed in the EONIA’s behaviour on certain occasions in the past has reduced quite significantly and we have taken note of this. Second, if you are so concerned about inflation pressures increasing, why were you not in a mode of strong vigilance today? Third, how would you describe the movement of the euro against the dollar in the past month, because this has also considerably tightened monetary conditions in the euro area? I will not comment – I never comment – on the market on a short-term basis. The market and all observers know that we take our decisions whenever we judge it to be appropriate in order to be able to deliver price stability in the medium run, as we have done in the first twelve years of the euro area. So I have just said everything on our position on behalf of the Governing Council at this present meeting. As you know, we are never pre-committed and we can always increase rates whenever we judge it to be appropriate. As regards the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we always incorporate the exchange rate situation in our own analysis. Fully in line with what we have always done. It is one of the parameters that we incorporate, but we have also all other considerations. Again it is one of the parameters among others. Let me only say that I took particular note when, on 26 April 2011, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, said “Our policy has been and will always be, as long, at least, as I am in this job, that a strong dollar is in our interests as a country. And we will never embrace a strategy of trying to weaken our currency to gain economic advantage at the expense of our trading partners.” Of course, the US Secretary of the Treasury was referring to the relationship between the dollar and the other major floating currencies. On 27 April 2011, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System said that the Federal Reserve System believes that a strong and stable dollar is both, in the American interest and in the interest of the global economy. Here, Ben Bernanke was also alluding to the position of the dollar vis-à-vis the other major floating currencies. I consider these statements to be important and I also share in full the analysis of these two authorities. My second question is on your non-standard measures. You have refrained from intervening in the bond markets for five weeks now and some of your colleagues have suggested that we might continue to see little activity. Are you going to actually announce a formal end to this programme at some stage in the near term or are you instead going to leave the facility open but just inactive? My third question is on the liquidity framework going forward. Did you discuss this at all at today’s meeting and are we likely to see a return to competitive bidding in at least some of your operations in the third quarter? As regards your first question, you will have to wait until our next meeting to see what we decide. As regards our credibility, let me say that the fact that we were the first big central bank in the world to increase rates does not create any problems with our credibility, particularly in view of our record of achievement in terms of meeting our definition of price stability over the first 12 years of the euro – you know the yearly average figure by heart: 1.97%. In answer to your second question, you see every week what we do with regard to the Securities Markets Programme. We are transparent in this respect, as we have always been. On your third point, we did not discuss the liquidity framework at today’s Governing Council meeting. Second, I have a question on the money markets: it seems like the process of normalisation went on for quite a while, but now it seems to have hit something of a brick wall. Do you share that assessment or do you think that the money markets are still improving? Could you repeat that question, please? Finally, I would like to ask about Portugal. What is your message to politicians here in Finland about the Portugal package? We seem to be very intent on derailing it… To answer your first question I would not say at all that we have changed in any respect our attitude towards inflation. Our present analysis was explained clearly a moment ago and I repeat: “With interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remaining low and the monetary policy stance accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability”. It is our judgement that there are upside risks to price stability. “Maintaining price stability is our guiding principle, which we apply when assessing new information, forming our judgments and deciding on any further adjustment of the accommodative stance of monetary policy.” We will always do everything that is necessary to deliver price stability. We have been clear on this for more than 12 years. We give the benchmark, we give the yardstick, and you judge on the basis of what we deliver in the medium term. We are looking at the threat of second-round effects and are monitoring all developments very closely. This is certainly not benign neglect in any respect and our message to price-setters, as well as social partners to the extent that they are themselves price-setters, is crystal clear. With regard to your question on the money markets, yes, we are seeing a progressively more appropriate functioning of the money markets, which is visible in the positioning of the EONIA. It would be good if it were confirmed that the volatility of the EONIA is now less pronounced than before. It is also clear from the liquidity situation of banks and money markets all over the euro area that there are signs of a more normal functioning. That being said, it is not yet been fully achieved. As regards Portugal, the very clear message from the Governing Council is that we expect all countries to live up to their responsibilities in the present circumstances. And also, one of the members of the ECB’s Governing Council, while ruling out the idea of restructuring Greek debt, has mentioned the possibility of extending the maturities on Greek loans. Is that actually an option in your view? First of all, I think I have been clear that our message on fiscal policies was a message to all countries concerned, and our message has always been to all countries – including Greece. But it is absolutely clear that the key issue for credibility, the key issue for creditworthiness, the key issue as regards taking full advantage of the ongoing recovery in Europe is credibility in achieving fiscal sustainability. Again, this applies to everybody – and particularly those who have the most hard work to do. As regards the question of restructuring, we consider that what is important is, again, to do the job, to adjust. There is a plan, and we call for the implementation of the plan! That’s all to say, full stop! My second question is on Portugal. I know there have been briefings going on in Lisbon today. Could you explain what the ECB’s role is going to be as regards providing liquidity to Portuguese banks? Will it be the same as in the case of Greece and Ireland in that you will continue to provide liquidity on an unlimited basis for the foreseeable future, but there will be no special vehicle, no special measures for those three countries? There seems to be confusion as to how exactly this is going to work for Portuguese banks. Perhaps you could help by clarifying that. And since there seems to be a bit of question inflation – everyone’s going for three – can I just ask what you thought of Mr Bernanke’s first press conference? Did you give him any tips beforehand? First, on the question of normalisation, I never use that word. I don’t think we have a policy of “normalisation”. We have a policy of setting interest rates, at any particular moment in time, at the level which would allow us to deliver price stability. And this is based on an analysis which incorporates all the elements that are at stake. As I have already said, this is a multidimensional analysis. So, again we take the decisions necessary for the delivery of price stability over the medium-term. As regards Portugal, we have no new concept or new window. We will apply our rules and decisions on refinancing will be taken on the basis of our framework – the framework decided by the Governing Council. So there is nothing new or special that I could mention in this respect. As regards your third question, I will not pass judgment on this press conference. You know that we have always ourselves – since the very beginning of the euro – thought it was appropriate to have press conferences, and you know that better than anybody, because you actively participate in these press conferences. It’s a way of clarifying the way the Governing Council – and, on the other side of the Atlantic, the Open Market Committee – sees things. We have always thought that this was useful. We perhaps had an additional reason to think it was useful, given that we are issuing a currency for what are now 17 different countries, and this calls for appropriate unification of communication. And you know that I have immense respect and esteem for Ben Bernanke. I didn’t say that. We all have our own economy, and our economies all have their own structures, features, shocks to cope with rigidities and flexibilities. We each have our own overall responsibilities, and we each take our own decisions taking all of that into account. At times our interest rates are above others, and at other times they are not. You have seen that since the setting-up of the euro, and it is normal. I will respond very simply: absolutely not. We are responsible for price stability in the euro area as a whole. It is on that basis that the euro is judged and assessed by all observers, economists, institutions, market participants and so forth. We will continue to deliver price stability in line with our definition. Again, I have made the point quite regularly that we currently have countries that have a very encouraging level of growth and we have others that are lagging behind. Not so long ago – say four to five years ago – it was exactly the opposite: the countries that are now adjusting were growing very fast – some of them, at least. And some of the countries that are today growing very fast were experiencing very slow growth. So again, we are an immense economy with 330 million people, so you expect some differences in behaviour. What counts is the average. And as regards the average, as I have said, we see the risks for the economy of the euro area as a whole as being broadly balanced. We see risks on the upside and risks on the downside. We also see that, since the start of the recovery, when we have corrected our projections every quarter we have tended to increase them. Particularly for the first quarter of this year, we have the sentiment that both the survey and other data were confirming that growth was there. Again, this is not the time to claim victory. Certainly not. We have to remain very prudent and cautious. But from this perspective, the recovery has, to date, been confirmed without too much doubt. Again, we will see, what are the facts, and we are never complacent. Secondly, on normalisation, there are some Board members who do use the word “normalisation”. Is there a conceptual difference, a difference of substance within the Board when this is referred to, or is this just a question of semantics? And one last thing. It was the first meeting that the Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann attended. Could I perhaps have a comment from the participating panellists on how his first meeting went? I am the porte-parole of the Governing Council and I already said what I had to say on normalisation. I don’t know exactly to whom you are alluding. My understanding is that if there is something there, it is pure semantics. Because I don’t see any difference of views in the Governing Council on what I said, namely that we are always doing at any moment what we judge necessary to deliver price stability in the medium-term. Again, we were unanimous today, as we were unanimous, as you might remember when we increased rates in our last meeting. As regards Portugal, I said a moment ago on behalf of the Governing Council exactly what we think which is: we clearly consider that the programme contains the necessary elements to bring about a sustainable stabilisation of the Portuguese economy. We also mention the fact that it is important that there is broad political support for this adjustment programme, which is the case, meaning that we have a large array of political sensitivities behind the programme. On this basis, we are confident. Of course, it calls for the present government in the time that it has and future governments to do their job, to adjust, which is – as I said already – absolutely essential. On your last question, as chairman of the Governing Council I very warmly welcome Jens Weidmann as our new member. I also had the opportunity – and you were a witness, it seems to me – to welcome him at the Bundesbank itself when there was the “passing of the baton”, between Axel and Jens. Again on behalf of the Governing Council, I very warmly welcome our new member, whom I have known personally for a significant period of time. The Governing Council took a decision a certain number of months ago, and we have no new decision which would be in the pipeline. And my second question. There is a discussion that restructuring of Greek debt could become necessary, but the ECB – some members of the Board – said that this is a bigger risk than Lehman was. Could you explain that? What is the big danger if that happened? First of all, our message on fiscal policies is directed at all countries, and we feel that it is not only the case in Greece or in Portugal, or in the countries that are under a programme. We feel that fiscal balances may fall behind the targets agreed by the ECOFIN Council, and, you know, there is monitoring of all countries according to the Stability and Growth Pact. Experience has demonstrated that this was absolutely essential. We are on record as having said, when several, very important countries wanted to “demolish” the Stability and Growth Pact in 2004 and 2005, that in a single currency area without a fully fledged political federation we need a fiscal framework, which is essential. So we call permanently on all countries, not only on those who have difficulties or major difficulties today, but on all countries to be extremely alert in this area. Again, I already responded as regards the restructuring. We consider that it is not on the cards. We apply a plan, and the plan is, as soon as possible, to get the country concerned into a situation in which it has a primary surplus in its own fiscal position. This would be absolutely key to reinforcing credibility, restoring creditworthiness and having the appropriate kind of interaction with its own financial environment. And my question for Mr Liikanen: You have been a policy-maker in the European Union at multinational level ever since Finland joined the EU in 1995, and, during its membership of the EU, Finland has gained a sort of track record as being a model student in the European cooperation. Have you received any queries from your colleagues about why the political mood in Finland has now changed to being so uncooperative in the European framework? And, finally, my question for Mr Constâncio: What is your personal message to the Finnish people? Why should Finnish taxpayers guarantee funding for Portugal? I will respond to your first question for my part. I must be very cautious because these decisions have to be taken by the appropriate bodies, including the IMF, but, as far as I understand, what is perhaps envisaged, depending on the decision of each particular institution, would be a contribution from the IMF of one third and a contribution from the Europeans of two thirds. In the contribution from the Europeans you have to take into account the fact that we have two bodies, the EFSF and the EFSM, which, as has been the case before, could each contribute one third, so the two thirds would be shared between the EFSF and the EFSM. I would only add that we, the Governing Council, are calling on all countries to live up to their responsibility in the circumstances. Liikanen: President, I share what you have said in this press conference of the Governing Council. But, as there is a wish to hear my opinion, as a former EU ambassador and Commissioner, on this situation, I will communicate myself over the next weekend on that issue also. But this is the press conference of the Governing Council, so I totally share what the President has said on this matter. Constâncio: Appearances to the contrary, here I am an institution, so I have no personal messages, and in that respect the President has expressed perfectly what the message of the institution is. Secondly, there were recently some comments by our former finance minister, Brian Lenihan, about the ECB’s role in the Irish bailout. He claimed that the ECB bounced Ireland into a bailout and that the ECB had actually betrayed Ireland. Do you have any concerns about those comments? Is that your understanding of how things went in the run up to the bailout? First of all, in the case of Ireland we have a plan which has been approved by the international community – the entire world – and by the Europeans and which is being implemented by the Government. We also had a plan for reshaping the banking sector which, as far as I know, was regarded by observers and by market participants as credible. And we share the view that it is credible. As regards your second question I have no particular comment on what has been said by any speaker. I would only say that the level of commitment of the Eurosystem to Ireland has absolutely no historical precedent. So the facts speak for themselves. We are siding with Ireland in the difficult circumstances. It is not the problem. And the second is that, on many occasions now you have spoken with reference to addicted banks and the need for them to pay urgent attention to improving capital and their efficiency. To which banks are you referring, how much longer will you give this warning and what would be the consequences of a failure to heed the warning? As you could perhaps see in March this year, market expectations were that we would not increase rates at any point during the year. The Governing Council then said “we are in a posture of strong vigilance”, and market expectations changed immediately. So what counts is what we do and we will always do what is necessary to deliver price stability in the medium term. I have no other comment on market expectations which would go against current expectations. With regard to addicted banks, we did not discuss the question of providing liquidity or the liquidity framework today, so I have nothing more to say than what I have already said, namely that it was an issue that we were meditating upon. If and when we have something to say, I will announce it to you all on behalf of the Governing Council. I already responded to all of these types of question. Nothing else to be said. We have a plan, we will apply the plan. This is not part of the plan. As you know, we are constantly in very close contact with the Bank of Japan. We have had the immense chance in the difficulties that we have had to cope with for the last three years to foster very intimate cooperation between the central banks in the world. And I do not only include cooperation with central banks in advanced economies, but also those in emerging economies. It is a very closely intertwined network. You also know that we gave a very clear signal to Japan after the earthquake as regards the exchange rate, and I think our message was well taken by market participants. If there is anything we could do to continue to reinforce our cooperation, we will certainly do it and we are in permanent contact with Masaaki Shirakawa. There is nothing particular that I have to mention on this now though. There was indeed a question on this. I said we are transparent, you see what we do. I have nothing else to say. You see what we do. Well, it was not the first time. Over the recent period, there have been very few weeks where the offers that we had were a little bit shorter than what we wanted to recuperate. My understanding is that we are in a particular episode and we are back to the question of whether the market is functioning in a better fashion. We are obviously looking at the behaviour of our banks, which are asking for somewhat less liquidity in our own refinancing operations. This is my present interpretation of why this occurred, but we are looking carefully at it. I have nothing else to say at this stage. "
07/04/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Before we report on the outcome of today’s meeting, we wish to express our sincere sympathy to the people of Japan, after the tragic events and lamentable loss of life. All our thoughts are with those who have suffered directly or indirectly from the natural and nuclear disaster. Let me now start reporting on the outcome of today’s meeting. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after maintaining them unchanged for almost two years at historically low levels. The adjustment of the current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis. While our monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. Thus, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and thereby continues to lend considerable support to economic activity and job creation. Recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity continues to be positive, with uncertainty remaining elevated. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. As stated on previous occasions, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will also be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area in early 2011. Looking ahead, euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing recovery in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to economic growth, benefiting from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, continued strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, in particular in view of ongoing geopolitical tensions, and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. Finally, there are potential risks stemming from the economic impact on the euro area and elsewhere of the recent natural and nuclear disaster in Japan. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.6% in March 2011, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.4 % in February. The increase in inflation rates in early 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices. Pressure stemming from the sharp increases in energy and food prices is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It is of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not lead to second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and thereby give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices, not least owing to ongoing political tensions in North Africa and the Middle East. More generally, strong economic growth in emerging markets, supported by ample liquidity at the global level, may further fuel commodity price rises. Moreover, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 2.0% in February 2011, from 1.5% in January. Looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth owing to special factors, M3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also increased further to 2.6% in February, from 2.4% in the previous month. Hence, the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually picking up, but remains moderate. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, annual M1 growth moderated further to 2.9% in February 2011, while the growth of other short-term deposits and marketable instruments has increased. This rebalancing within M3 reflects the impact of the recent steepening of the yield curve on the remuneration of different monetary assets. However, this steeper yield curve also implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. On the counterpart side, a further rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector in February is due in part to a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which rose to 0.6% in February, after 0.5% in January. The growth of loans to households was 3.0% in February, compared with 3.1% in January. Overall, in early 2011 the positive flow of lending to the non-financial private sector has become more broadly based across the household and non-financial corporation sectors. The latest data confirm that banks have expanded their lending to the private sector further, while at the same time the overall size of their balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, the Governing Council decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The adjustment of the current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis. A cross-check with the signals from our monetary analysis indicates that while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. Thus, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and thereby continues to lend considerable support to economic activity and job creation. Recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity continues to be positive, with uncertainty remaining elevated. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Turning to fiscal policies, it is essential that all governments achieve the consolidation targets for 2011 that they have announced. Moreover, the announcement of fully specified consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond would help to convince the general public and market participants that the corrective policies will be sustained. Strengthened confidence in the sustainability of public finances is key, as this will reduce interest rate risk premia and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. At the same time, it is crucial that substantial and far-reaching structural reforms be urgently implemented in the euro area to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness and flexibility. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be further pursued to speed up restructuring and to facilitate advances in productivity. On the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. Finally, the Governing Council is of the view that the package of six legislative proposals on economic governance, adopted by the European Council at its summit on 24-25 March 2011, goes some way to improving economic and budgetary surveillance in the euro area. However, in our view, the proposals fall short of the necessary quantum leap in the surveillance of the euro area which is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union. Therefore, the Governing Council, in line with the ECB’s opinion of 17 February 2011 on these proposals, urges the ECOFIN Council, the European Parliament and the Commission to agree, in the context of their “trialogue”, on more stringent requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness. All this would help to ensure that the new framework is effective in the long run. We are now at your disposal for questions. Also, could you please tell us whether this decision was unanimous, whether there were any calls for a 50 basis point increase or even for leaving rates unchanged? And a third question: did the ECB encourage Portugal to seek aid? As regards your second question, the decision taken today by the Governing Council was unanimous. It was a decision taken in order to enable us to deliver in the future, as we have done in the past, price stability over the medium term, in line with our definition. As regards your first question we did not decide today that it would be the first of a series of interest rate increases. We will continue to do in the future what we have done in the past, namely to take decisions that are necessary for the delivery of price stability in the medium term. With regard to Portugal, we encouraged the Portuguese authorities to do what was commanded by the situation, given the recent political developments in the country. I also have question on today’s rate hike: the headlines having been saying that this would put further strain on the peripheral countries. I do not necessarily buy that argument, but what do you say to that? I am very happy that you do not buy that argument. In answer to your first question, I would say again that, if you take the euro area as a whole, you have an economy that is integrated. It is a single market with a single currency. Its external current account is balanced and its currency has kept its value over 12 years with an average annual rate of inflation of 1.97%. Furthermore, according to all projections, the public finance deficit for this year will be approximately half that of other advanced economies, namely Japan or the United States. Nevertheless, there are a number of countries in the euro area that need to correct their situation, not just in terms of their fiscal policies, but also in terms of their economic policies. Plans are in place in some countries and, in our view the plans need to be rigorously applied. Plans will also be defined in one other country, which is something that we welcome, and these plans too will need to be applied. For all countries, we continue to recommend that they stay ahead of the curve. In answer to your second question, I will only say that we are responsible for ensuring price stability for 331 million people, and all the decisions that we have taken since the very beginning of the euro, including today’s, have been designed to deliver price stability to 331 million people. What we decide is designed to deliver what we are called upon by our primary mandate to deliver for all 17 countries and all our fellow citizens. Price stability is of extreme importance for growth and job creation in the euro area as a whole. Of course, all countries would benefit directly or indirectly from the fact that the euro area as a whole will have more growth and more job creation, in particular because, with inflation expectations being well-anchored, we will have a financial environment in which medium and long-term interest rates in the market will be lower than if inflation expectations were higher. This is pure arithmetic. I would also add that high inflation is a particular burden for the most vulnerable and the poorest of our fellow citizens. We call upon all countries, not only the countries that you have mentioned, to be ahead of the curve in terms of their public finances, in terms of maintaining their costs at a competitive level; and last but not least in terms of embarking on the appropriate structural reforms. This is very important, particularly the structural reforms. Our message is for all. Of course, some are in a particular situation which calls for hard work and the particularly active implementation of adjustment plans. My second question goes back to Glass-Steagall. I’ve been here in Frankfurt for the last month and there is increased discussion of Glass-Steagall. Also, in London, the Treasury Select Committee issued a report today calling for a separation of retail banking and investment banking in Britain – or at least ring-fencing it within the banks. Has a “twin” banking system or Glass-Steagall approach been discussed within the ECB? On your first question, we have a very clear message for the banks that has been sent very often by the Governing Council and, indeed, today I mentioned the fact that to address the challenge that they face, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to further strengthen their capital bases or, if they have difficulty in doing that, to take full advantage of the government support measures for recapitalisation. So, we have a very strong message for banks: to do what is necessary to put themselves in a situation as healthy as possible to be able, of course, to do their job, which is to finance the real economy. As regards the financing of the real economy, you have the figures. Credit to euro area residents has increased by 3.8% overall. Regarding loans, I mentioned the fact that we have had an increase, albeit very slight, in the overall amount of outstanding loans to the non-financial corporate sector, and we have confirmation that loans to households grew at the level of 3.1% last month, and they have grown 3% this month. The whole economy benefits from interest rates that solidly anchor inflation expectations and from the effect on confidence of this medium-term stability. It is good for medium and long-term market interest rates, it is good for the financial environment, and it is good for confidence – not only the confidence of economic agents or corporate businesses, but also the confidence of our fellow citizens, which is essential. And we never forget that it is to our fellow citizens that we owe a duty to maintain price stability. On the second question, as you know, Europeans have no past experience of a separation between investment banking and retail banking. The concept of many banks in Europe is that their activity is comprehensive – they have, or can have, both franchises. We are certainly following very carefully the global debate on banks in general within the various working parties that exist – not least, of course, the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board. And secondly, just on monetary policy itself, you said the Governing Council has not decided that today’s move will be the first of a series of increases. And you have said nothing so far that would make anyone think another increase in interest rates was likely in the next month or so. But given that upside risks to inflation remain and, as you say, policy remains accommodative, would markets be correct in assuming that further interest rate increases are likely later this year? I already said on the first question that, if and when we decide something on that front, you can be sure that we will make it public immediately. So let me only say that we are reflecting on it. It is an important issue which has more or less changed in nature over time, with the correlation between sovereign difficulty and banks’ difficulty. And that is the reason why we call on both the sovereign and the banks to take all appropriate measures to consolidate, preserve and, where necessary, improve significantly their own credibility, because everything depends on the confidence that market investors and savers have in the sovereign and in the banks themselves. So, again, if and when we decide, we will make it public immediately. On the Irish banks, we welcomed the decision of the government to recapitalise and we did that in liaison with the IMF and the European Commission. We all three welcomed the decision that was taken. And we took a decision on collateral. It seems to me that the market has understood that these were important decisions. I already mentioned, on your third question, that we did not decide it was the first of a series of interest rate increases. But you know from our own “doctrine” and from the past that we always do what we judge necessary to deliver price stability in the medium term. So I confirm that we will do all that is necessary to deliver price stability in line with our definition in the medium term. We did not decide that it was the first of a series of interest rate increases. And second: maybe it is a historic moment today because the ECB is acting before other major central banks. In 2004 and 2005 the ECB followed the steps of the Fed; this time you are the first to move. Are you sending a signal there for the euro area or to other central banks? As regards your first question, as I said, we were unanimous. All colleagues were there, including Axel Weber. And, again, we were unanimous. As regards your second question, neither the Fed, nor us, nor the Bank of England, nor the Bank of Japan has reason to say: “I am the first”, “I am the second”, “I am a follower”, “I am a leader,” and so forth. That is not the issue. The issue is for us to do our job, to be faithful to our mandate and to take into account circumstances that are never the same. On both sides of the Atlantic we have enormous responsibilities. We in Europe have a very important economy of more than 300 million people and we have to take decisions that are appropriate. We have never had the sentiment that we were the followers of anybody and we do not have the sentiment of being the leader. We do what we have to do. And what is very important, of course, is that we give the benchmark: you know what our definition of price stability is in the medium term and you judge us on our own results. We give the yardstick, we give the benchmark, and you can control what we do and, over the years, you see what the results are. And my second question is on the bond-buying programme. With Portugal now under the rescue umbrella, does that change anything for your bond-buying programme? And what would happen if there were signs that financial markets were turning their attention to Spain and there was a risk of contagion there? On your first question I have no particular comment. We have rules and we are respecting them. And I think that the communication that accompanied the very important decision to recapitalise the bank by the government was understood by all those who are observing what this government does and what we are doing ourselves. On the SMP programme I would only say that, you see – not month after month, but week after week – what we are doing. It is a programme that is very visible. And you will see what we do in the future. I have no other comment on the SMP. And then also on the interest rate crisis, I think people back in Ireland do appreciate that the ECB has a responsibility to all 17 countries. But equally there are a lot of people in Ireland who are already finding things very difficult and are already really struggling. Do you have anything to say to them in the context of today’s interest rate increase? On the first question, I would say that it is really a question to be discussed by the government and the fund suppliers. I have no particular comment. On the second question, I would say that it is in the interest of all members and partners of the single market with the single currency that we maintain maximum credibility for the anchoring of inflation expectations. As I already said, it is good for the euro area as a whole that we have these well-anchored inflation expectations. It is good for confidence, which benefits everybody, including of course those who are in most difficulty at present. It is extremely important because we are all intimately intertwined and because the long and medium-term interest rate markets crucially depend on the level of inflation expectations. So, all countries without exception have a major interest in us being faithful to our primary mandate, directly or indirectly. Let me express again the emotion of the Governing Council, the emotion of the Executive Board, and the emotion of the ECB. We were in close contact with the governor of the Bank of Japan, and with all our friends in Japan. I have to say that we admire the resilience of the Japanese people in such dramatic circumstances. On the global growth rate, we could see the immediate impact on the global PMI for instance. What we expect is that it has an immediate impact, which is big obviously, and then, as was observed at the time of the Kobe earthquake, we see the profile going up again, even sharply up, because you have to reconstruct and you have to invest again in very large areas. The devastation has been absolutely abominable. I saw on YouTube that there were some videos that had been seen by 17 million people or more. It is so abominable. A lot of reconstruction will take place. The expectation is that after a certain period of time, this dramatic episode will be absorbed. But we have to be realistic and when I was mentioning risks, I explicitly mentioned the associated risks for us from this dramatic natural event through the global economy. I also note en passant – as I mentioned in recent speeches or articles – that when we call for maximum soundness of fiscal policies, we have to take into account not only a financial crisis, but also natural crises. And of course in such dramatic events the ultimate protection comes from the public finances. So the credibility of public finances is absolutely decisive, not only to permit the economy to be more resilient in dramatic circumstances, but also because events of this kind do happen. On the impact on energy prices, we will see what happens exactly. We do not have of course a competence in nuclear power plants. We will see how to permit to reassure fully the Japanese people, but also all other people in the world, that such events can be controlled and prevented. I think that a number of lessons have already been drawn from what has happened. I mentioned as a risk the combination of the Japanese event, particularly its nuclear aspect, with what happens in the Middle East and in North Africa, because all this clearly combines to create risks. And then, secondly, regarding the bank stress tests that are coming up in June, I wonder if you could update us on what your level of confidence is that they will do more to restore confidence in the banking system than the last round of stress tests? I wonder how Ben Bernanke would respond if he was asked whether he did this or that because of California or because of another big state? Germany is a large economy, the largest economy in the constellation of economies that we have in the euro area. We make our decisions taking into account the 17 countries, the 331 million people and the overall GDP of the euro area. No more, no less. Germany grew extremely slowly during the first few years of the euro. Germany is now growing much more actively, which is a good thing, and I am happy that I no longer have to respond to the usual questions I faced during the first few years of my mandate about Germany being the sick man of the euro area! We had an episode of a return to competitiveness, of hard work, and now we see the result of this hard work. It is good for Germany and good for the euro area as a whole. And again, we take our decisions on the basis of the average of this very vast continental economy, which is of a similar size to the United States. As regards the stress tests, we very strongly encourage all those who have a responsibility in this exercise, including the national supervisors and the European Banking Authority. When the time comes, particularly when we have to embark on the peer review, the ESRB will also be involved, as it is required by legislation. It is important that the stress tests are carried out professionally, as is, of course, the intention of all partners. And my second question is, do you see any evidence yet of second-round effects, whether it is wages or some kind of concrete evidence of higher inflation expectations? With regard to your first question, we did not decide that it was the first of a series of interest rate increases. We always do what is necessary, taking into account the delivery of our mandate, namely price stability in the medium term. So, when we have something new to say, I will tell you. As regards the second question, we have not seen an un-anchoring of inflation expectations. It is of extreme importance that we have been able to maintain this anchoring of inflation expectations throughout the entire period that we have gone through and which has been – at least for the last three and a half years – particularly demanding. So, we are well anchored. But this depends on us and depends on the fact that everybody recognises that we will do what is necessary to deliver price stability. So we look at all the surveys and information extracted from the markets, including the five-year forward five-year break-even inflation rate, as very important indicators. As regards the second-round effects, we want to clearly signal that we are extremely alert in this respect and our message is that we will not accept and we will not tolerate second-round effects. This is because if there were to be second-round effects, this would mean that we would have a higher level of inflation in the medium term, which is not in line with our definition of price stability, as well as – all things being equal – higher medium and long-term market interest rates, and a worsening environment for confidence, growth and job creation. And it would also mean higher inflation for the poorest of our fellow citizens. So, avoiding second-round effects is essential and our message is very strong for all price setters – as I said in the introductory remarks on behalf of the Governing Council – and for all social partners. We discussed that. We assessed the pros and cons of maintaining 75 basis points, that is, 150 between the top and the bottom, or to go back to 200. We considered that it was appropriate at this stage to maintain this, but there are various dimensions for this assessment and we will see when the time comes whether we can change the width of the corridor. We should not confuse the rate of growth of the monetary aggregate and the overhang, the stock. When I referred to the fact that we had ample liquidity which could materialise in some kind of risks to price stability, I was referring not to the present increase of the outstanding monetary aggregates, but the hangover that had been accumulated before the crisis. That’s the explanation. We are used to having our own analysis and it does not necessary coincide with the analysis of some observers, some market participants, some economists and even some international institutions. I can remember decisions we took to increase interest rates which were not recommended by any international institution. Very fortunately now, with the benefit of hindsight, they would say: “Yes, you did well”, so I don’t insist on that. In any case, we are responsible ourselves and we are judged by our people on the basis of what we deliver. It goes without saying that when you have a shock like the one we are presently observing, which is a price shock coming from oil and commodities, it is very important to avoid the second-round effects: It is our clear message today that we won’t accept second-round effects. We have a plan and we apply the plan. It is clear that countries that had in the first years of the euro area a behaviour which was unsound have to engage in a correction. Whatever is done, whatever happens, whatever the overall environment is; in any case, they have to correct what had been done in the past and what was wrong. It is true for absolutely all, particularly for those who had abnormal behaviour, which is certainly the case of the country you mentioned. Again, our message is for everybody. Our message to everybody is not to regard the present level of inflation as the normal level of inflation in the medium to long-term, because we are responsible for delivering inflation of less than, but close to, 2%, as we have done in the past. And that is the right benchmark. I have no immediate analysis as to what has been done in this case. But if it is based on projections for inflation in the medium term which are not in line with our definition, I would say there are abnormal elements in this deal. And second, the Irish government wanted to have private investors participate in the losses of the banks, just before the stress tests. I think it was the Finance Minister in the Irish government who said that the ECB didn’t want it. Is this true? And if so, why? I have already given a precise response to the first question. It’s an issue that we are looking at. It has changed in nature over time because of the correlation between the creditworthiness of governments and the creditworthiness of banks. We are looking at it. If and when we have a decision, I will make it public immediately. On your second question, I don’t want to enter into details, but as far as I recall, there are subordinated bonds that are not treated in the same fashion as others. What we are permanently asking all of our partners to do is to consider the confidence of the market. Because what is important, is to go back to the market as soon as possible. When you are back in the market, you are in a normal situation. And then you don’t need any more help, you don’t need any abnormal refinancing, and you don’t need to be placed in an abnormal situation. So there are responsibilities on the part of all governments and authorities concerned. The main message is confidence, to try to do everything that improves the confidence of the savers, the investors and the market participants. And second, on the issue of Portugal, if S&P or Moody’s continue to downgrade Portuguese bonds, will the ECB continue to accept these bonds as collateral in its programme? First of all, let me take this opportunity to say that we have a very close relationship with the Chinese central bank. I personally have a very close relationship with Governor Zhou, and we meet very often. For instance, we were in Nanjing only a few days ago, and we will meet again in Basel. And of course, I don’t want to encroach in any way on the very important responsibilities of the People’s Bank of China. As I have said in the past, central banks do not take the same decisions, as they are not in the same situation. But what really characterises all central bankers is that they have a unity of purpose – and that purpose is solidly anchoring inflation expectations. So, I have no particular message for Governor Zhou in this situation. As regards your second question on Portugal, when we take a decision we will make it public. I have no other comment. And the second question is on the money market in general. How would you describe its development? Has there been a steady normalisation in the last month? And could you give us a bit of insight as to how the money markets might develop in the next few months? On the first question, you know that we don’t necessarily wait for consensus when taking our decisions. We can take decisions because we have a meeting of the Governing Council and there is a majority. If necessary, we are able to decide extremely rapidly. I mention that merely as an aside. We can decide by majority decision, we can decide by consensus and we can decide unanimously. These are the three categories. So, we decided not to take any decision on the “persistent bidders”. That is all there is to say. Again, when we have a decision, I will let you know. It was not because there was no consensus. It was because we decided not to decide. As regards the Irish collateral, if I understand your question correctly, we took a decision which was in line with what we had done before, making the announcement following discussions with the Irish government, the IMF and the European Commission. As I have said, we welcome the result of this discussion and the very important decisions taken by the Irish government. So, we made the point very clearly. On the last question on the money market as a whole, I have nothing particular to say. In terms of non-standard measures, we still have, as you know, full allotment at a fixed rate in the three windows that we have. And that has implications for the functioning of the money market. I would say that the volatility of the EONIA today is lower than the volatility observed previously. And we have also seen – as you all have – that the excess liquidity observed in the past has been reduced considerably, but we still have excess liquidity. (Translated from French) No, it is exactly the opposite. It is because we want to maintain price stability for the 17 countries of the euro area and for the 331 million citizens of these countries, and especially because we are thinking of the poorest and the weakest among them, that we have to maintain confidence in the euro area as a whole. And that is what we are doing. We are maintaining the confidence of households; we are maintaining the confidence of entrepreneurs, of companies. And that is how we allow medium and long-term interest rates to stay at the level favourable to growth and job creation, because they incorporate expectations of low future inflation. And that is why we believe that we are directly and indirectly helping all countries, but especially those that most need to be in the best possible environment. They have difficulties at the moment; that is quite clear. They have plans, which they are implementing, and it is necessary to implement these plans very strictly, therefore they have to give themselves the means to find confidence again. We do what we have to, in the interest of everybody: of all the countries, without exception, and of all citizens, without exception. As I said, interest rates are low, and when people borrow, it depends on the country: some are borrowing on a short-term basis, others on a medium-term basis or a long-term basis. And we have to consider, of course, all interest rates. And in preserving price stability we are also preserving a financial environment that, everything else being equal, is better than one in which we do not anchor inflation expectations. That is the reason why we consider that there is no contradiction, but full complementarity in doing what is essentially a fulfilment of our primary mandate: i.e. delivering price stability, and growth and job creation, and protecting the poorest of our fellow citizens. We have only one primary mandate. That primary mandate is price stability. That primary mandate commanded us, as far as standard measures were concerned, to take appropriate interest rate decisions that were designed to deliver price stability. The past testifies to what we have been doing, including past criticism of our own interest rate increases. Criticism in 2004 by very eloquent parties, telling us to decrease our interest rates which we refused to do. Criticism in December 2005 by governments and international institutions, saying that we should not increase rates. Criticism in 2008 – and you remember that. So, again, we do what we have to do even when it is difficult, even when it is not necessarily pleasing everybody. That is our job. Second, we engaged in non-standard measures because we had monetary policy transmission mechanisms that were not functioning properly, and we took a number of measures to permit them to function better. That was a result of the fact that financial stability was not preserved by national governments, private institutions, executive branches, or parliaments, in some cases; it was because we have a responsibility with regard to monetary policy, and the mandate to deliver price stability. But it is the responsibility of governments individually and collectively to avoid in the future to being again in the very abnormal situation that we had to cope with. That is the reason why we are so strong in calling for appropriate governance, in calling for the reinforcement of governance by all means possible, and in calling on governments to fulfil their responsibilities and to have a sense of direction. I already said that all governments have to be ahead of the curve; that Spain did a lot of things in the past that we approved of; and that Spain still has things to do. And there are a number of measures that are in the pipeline, particularly as regards structural reforms in the labour market. So, I am sure that these reforms are anticipated by the observers and by everybody in Spain. It is extremely important that Spain continues along the same lines: these lines were defined months ago, and have progressively been appreciated, by the observers, the savers, and the investors, as going in the right direction. "
03/03/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information which has become available since our meeting on 3 February 2011 indicates a rise in inflation, largely reflecting higher commodity prices. The economic analysis indicates that risks to the outlook for price developments are on the upside, while the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. Recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains positive; however, uncertainty remains elevated. The current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity. It is essential that the recent rise in inflation does not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Strong vigilance is warranted with a view to containing upside risks to price stability. Overall, the Governing Council remains prepared to act in a firm and timely manner to ensure that upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. The continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. The Governing Council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (MROs) and the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period of 2011 on 12 July 2011. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted on 27 April, 25 May and 29 June 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. As we have stated before, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in both the third and the fourth quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence continue to confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area at the beginning of 2011. Looking ahead, euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing recovery in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, benefiting from the very accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.3% and 2.1% in 2011 and between 0.8% and 2.8% in 2012. Compared with the December 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the lower ends of these ranges have been shifted upwards, reflecting better prospects for the global economy – and thus for euro area exports – as well as for domestic demand. The March 2011 ECB staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are broadly balanced in a context of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in commodity prices, in particular in view of renewed geopolitical tensions, and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in February 2011, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.3% in January. The increase in inflation rates in early 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices. Pressure stemming from the sharp increases in energy and food prices is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It is paramount that the rise in HICP inflation does not lead to second-round effects and thereby give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The March 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.0% and 2.6% for 2011 and between 1.0% and 2.4% for 2012. In comparison with the December 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for HICP inflation have been shifted upwards. This is mainly due to the considerable rise in energy and food prices. It should be stressed that the projections are based on commodity price futures as of mid-February 2011, and therefore do not take into account the most recent oil price increases. Moreover, it needs to be emphasised that the projections assume continued moderate domestic wage and price-setting behaviour. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy and non-energy commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity. Price and wage setters’ behaviour should not lead to broadly based second-round effects stemming from higher commodity prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 declined to 1.5% in January 2011, from 1.7% in December 2010, while the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased to 2.4% in January, from 1.9% in December. Looking beyond the movements in individual months and the effects of special factors, trends in broad money and loan growth confirm the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium to longer term should remain contained. At the same time, the low level of money and credit growth has thus far led to only a partial unwinding of the large amounts of monetary liquidity accumulated in the economy prior to the period of financial tensions. This liquidity may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures currently emerging in commodity markets as a result of strong economic growth and ample liquidity at the global level. Looking at M3 components, annual M1 growth moderated further to stand at 3.2% in January 2011, reflecting the prevailing low remuneration of overnight deposits. At the same time, the yield curve steepened somewhat further at the start of the year, implying that the attractiveness of short-term instruments included in M3 continues to decline compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. On the counterpart side, the rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector in January was due to stronger lending to both households and non-financial corporations. The growth of loans to non-financial corporations turned positive, to stand at 0.4% in January, after -0.2% in December, while the growth of loans to households strengthened further to 3.1%, from 2.9% in December. Overall, lending to the non-financial private sector has gradually strengthened over the past few quarters, as the economic recovery gathered momentum. The latest data also confirm that banks have continued to expand their lending to the euro area economy, while at the same time keeping the overall size of their balance sheets broadly unchanged. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information which has become available since our meeting on 3 February 2011 indicates a rise in inflation, largely reflecting higher commodity prices. The economic analysis indicates that risks to the outlook for price developments are on the upside, while the cross-check with the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. Recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains positive; however, uncertainty remains elevated. The current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity. It is essential that the recent rise in inflation does not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Strong vigilance is warranted with a view to containing upside risks to price stability. Overall, the Governing Council remains prepared to act in a firm and timely manner to ensure that upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. The continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, all governments need to fully implement their fiscal consolidation plans in 2011. Where necessary, additional corrective measures must be implemented swiftly to ensure progress in achieving fiscal sustainability. Beyond 2011, countries need to specify ambitious and concrete policy measures in their multi-year adjustment programmes, so as to underpin the credibility of their fiscal consolidation targets of ensuring a rapid correction of excessive deficits and returning to a close-to-balance or surplus position. Strengthening confidence in the sustainability of public finances is key, as this will reduce interest rate risk premia and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. At the same time, it is crucial that substantial and far-reaching structural reforms be implemented in the euro area to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness and flexibility. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be further pursued. On the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. The current sovereign debt crisis in the euro area has reinforced the need for an ambitious reform of the economic governance framework of the euro area. The Governing Council of the ECB is of the view that the legislative proposals which have been put forward by the European Commission go some way to improving economic and budgetary surveillance in the euro area. However, they fall short of the necessary quantum leap in the surveillance of the euro area which is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union. As outlined in the ECB’s opinion of 17 February 2011 on these proposals, more stringent requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness are required to ensure that the new framework will indeed be effective in the long run. We are now at your disposal for questions. And my second question is: Was the decision to leave the three-months tender at full allotment motivated by continued concerns about addicted banks? On your first point, the interest rate decision today was unanimous. We mentioned that we are being very vigilant and my understanding of the position of the Governing Council – fully in line with assessments made in the past - is that an increase in interest rates at the next meeting is possible. As you know, we never pre-commit ourselves. Our decision will - as always - be taken by the Governing Council and will depend on any new information and data we receive. So, it is not certain but it is possible. On your second question: as you know, we have a principle of separation between the standard measures and the non-standard measures. This principle has been reiterated many times and I have been very clear on that. We considered that the decision on non-standard measures was commensurate with our judgement on the functioning of the financial market and of some segments of the market. We therefore decided to maintain the fixed-rate full allotment procedure, including for the three-month supply of liquidity. And secondly, is it possible that this is the start of something which you expect to continue in the coming months and for the rest of the year perhaps? Let me be very clear. Given my own understanding of the attitude of the Governing Council, we have expressed our judgement as clearly as possible. It means what I have just said. I would certainly not embark on anything more and it is certainly not a decision on the start of a series of interest rate increases. That would not be a correct interpretation. We had said already in January and February that the balance of risk emerging from the economic analysis could move on the upside. We have judged today that this balance of risk has moved on the upside and that is why we expressed our strong vigilance. The second question is: You mentioned the second-round effects. How do you judge the moves by the trade unions, the discussion between companies and the trade unions at the moment? Some contracts have already been concluded. Is this in your view o.k., from what you have already seen? The third question is: Did the Council discuss the political situation in North Africa and in the oil countries, i.e. what is going on there at the moment? How do you judge the impact of the oil price on price stability? As regards your first question, firstly an interest rate increase at the next meeting is possible, but it is not certain. In any case and as you know, we never pre-commit ourselves. We always take into account new data and new information. The decision will be taken at the next meeting by the Governing Council. This is standard practice. Secondly and as said already we have a separation principle. It seems to me that your question was more or less mixing up two things. Again, we have a clear doctrine. We do what we have to do to deliver price stability in the medium term, using the interest rate tool and our so-called standard measures. The non-standard measures take into account the fact that we have abnormal functioning of various markets or segments of the market. That is the way we operate and you have a clear demonstration today of the separation principle because we are maintaining the non-standard measures as they were in the first quarter and, at the same time, we indicate that we might change the standard measures. As regards your second question on the trade unions, our message is always that second-round effects should be avoided, when we have a commodities price shock, as we have now. This is the main responsibility of the central bank. Of course, we cannot change today the oil or commodity prices. But clearly we can avoid that moving oil prices are creating inflation in the medium term. That is why we are vigilant and it is again something which we are monitoring extremely closely. Our message for all price-setters, not only for the social partners, is that they have to take into account that we will deliver price stability in the medium term, in the future as we have done for the last twelve years. As you know, the yearly average inflation has been less than 2%, close to 2% for the last twelve years. This message is extremely important. I would add that in a large number of economies in the euro area we have unemployment which remains at a high level, and wage moderation, which takes due account of labour productivity progress but permits unit labour costs to preserve the highest level of competitiveness, is essential to combat unemployment. This is our message! As regards your third question I would only say that we ourselves mentioned the geo-political situation confronting us all in our overall appreciation, and we have to pay extremely close attention to what is unfolding. I will not say more than that. We are not ourselves responsible for assessing the political aspects of the geo-political situation. We leave that to those who are responsible, namely the executive branches. I would say it is not the appropriate interpretation in my opinion. But again, it’s a decision of the Governing Council. My second question was about the line which you have added warning banks that have limited access to market financing to urgently increase their capital and efficiency – is that perhaps a signal that we might see some ECB steps against addicted banks at the next meeting in April? I responded in real time to your first question. On the second question, again I refer to the separation principle: we are responsible and it is our primary mandate to deliver price stability to 331 million people. This is the size of the euro area. And we have delivered price stability, because it is our primary mandate and also because it is the very strong call from all our fellow citizens. Each time there is a survey or any kind of analysis of public opinion. We observe a very strong call by our fellow citizens that we ensure price stability. I have to say price stability is essential for the poorest of our fellow citizens and for the most vulnerable segment of the population. So again, it’s our primary mandate. With this in mind we take our monetary policy decision as regards the standard measures. Again that is our duty. As regards the non-standard measures, I mentioned already that we have decided not to change them at this stage. On the rest I will only mention that our call to commercial banks is a permanent message that we are delivering. I will not say anything on the timing of possible changes as regards the persistent bidders. If and when we have a plan we will announce it. No comment, thank you very much. And then, we have a new government in Ireland, or we will soon have, who are keen to tackle the interest rates payable on the bailout. Would the ECB be supporting that, i.e. a lowering of the interest rates payable by Ireland? On the first question, I would say that there is a plan and this plan has been approved by the IMF, by the European authorities, after due analysis by the Commission in liaison with us. We are calling for the plan to be applied. And that is something which we believe is absolutely essential. On the second point, I would say that this is a question for the executive branches that are delivering the loans in question to discuss. I will not say anything at this stage. It is up to the governments to see exactly what they would like to do or not. And the second question: the Hungarian Government has now introduced plans/legislation to change the status of the Hungarian central bank, to diminish its independence. You have expressed your unhappiness with that. Do you think that the European Commission should launch an infringement procedure against the Hungarian Government because of that legislation? On the first point we expressed very clearly, as you know, and in real time, when we had the first proposals made by the Commission, that we thought it was going in the right direction, as I re-iterated, but that it was not the “quantum leap” that we had judged appropriate to take into account the full lessons of the crisis. The governments had weakened, in their own appreciation of the situation, the first proposal of the Commission. Now the discussion is taking place in the European Parliament. We have a very strong message for the governments and we are giving them and, as you know, we have made public our own judgement, presenting our opinion on the changes in the legislation which are envisaged and which are currently being discussed in Parliament. I would sum up our own understanding by saying that the Commission did not go far enough. The governments have even weakened the position of the Commission. And, we are counting on the Parliament. This is not our decision; it is a decision which is taken by the Parliament and the Council. We are counting very much on the Parliament to help Europe, drawing all the lessons in terms of governance from what are, in our opinion, the main lessons of the crisis in this domain. So, again, we are very clear in our message to all European decision-makers, particularly the Council and the governments. On our website you have our opinion and you have a summary of our opinion in ten points that are the points of particular importance, including in particular automaticity – as much automaticity as possible – in the procedure for excessive deficits and for the sanctions, a judgement on the fiscal and economic situation which is as independent as possible, and so forth. This is essential for us. Again, we are thinking medium and long term, not short term. On your second question, I would only say that we were unsatisfied with the position which was taken by the Hungarian Government, and we will see exactly what the appropriate step is in order to take into account the new situation. We have already expressed our opinion. So, we will see. It is the responsibility of the Commission. At this stage, we have to study the case and see exactly what the optimum next legal step is. I do not exclude anything, including, the possibility that the Commission could take legal action. But, again, it is not our decision; it is the decision of the Commission. Perhaps we could look at the past. In the past you had very different rates of growth in, for instance, the same countries, the same economies, Spain and Germany. Germany was at that time growing very slowly and had the reputation of being the “sick man of Europe”, which was wrong, but Germany was growing very slowly. And Spain was growing extremely rapidly. We are responsible for delivering price stability at the level of the euro area as a whole, 331 million people, 17 countries, exactly like the Federal Reserve System has to deliver price stability at the level of the United States as a whole, even when North Dakota is growing at a fantastic speed and another state is stagnating. Again, we have to run an entire continent, and, various segments of the continent are in different situations. As you know, the standard deviation of growth between the states of the United States is of the same order of magnitude as the standard deviation of growth of the countries in the euro area. And my second question concerns Lithuania. What is your prognosis on the same point? I have to say that we did not examine this situation and I do not have any specific analysis that I can refer to. We always call for extreme prudence in our opinions regarding such decisions in the past and this is what we have always said in the past. But I do not have any other message at this stage. I have nothing else to add, other than to mention that we judge monetary policy to be very accommodative and that we are exercising strong vigilance, which is also in line with the fact that we are not saying that present interest rates are appropriate. Again, the message is a traditional message that we have given from time to time. I do not rule out an interest rate increase at the next meeting. It is not certain. We take our decision when we meet and are never pre-committed. I have said that before and I will say it again. We and the Federal Reserve have our own responsibilities, which are very important in both economies, the United States and the euro area. As you have seen, we have always taken our own decisions, taking into account our own responsibility, and at times we were taking decisions that were not necessarily the same. To be frank, they have never been the same. So, what we have done and are doing ourselves is to judge our own situation. You mentioned the fact that increases in oil and commodity prices are not necessarily creating inflation. I would say that you are right if the central bank avoids second round effects. That is the main danger when you have such shocks. And, these shocks have a multiple dimension. But what is extremely important for a central bank is to be sure that everybody understands that the anchoring of inflation expectations remains excellent and that nobody, economic agents or price-setters – not only the social partners, but all price-setters – can make the working assumption that, in the medium run, there would be a permanently high level of inflation. It is always what we have done in the past and will continue to do in the future. Our own track record is there. We are fully in line with what we trust is what our fellow citizens are calling on us to do. No. We see that there is a strong need to avoid second-round effects. At the moment we see inflation expectations still solidly anchored. And this is a major asset, in our situation, that we have preserved this solid anchoring of inflation expectations, which is confirmed by all of our analysis. Well, we will see when the Governing Council meets next month. I do not comment on exchange rates, as you know. Secondly, do you have any concerns that the prospect of an interest rate increase will undermine the recovery process in weakened economies such as Ireland and Greece? I have already responded to your second question, our responsibility is to the 331 million people of the euro area. But again, we are separating the standard and non-standard measures. And as regards the non-standard measures, you can see that we have kept the non-standard measures for the second quarter as they were for the first quarter. As regards your first question on the €10 billion, I would say that, for us, the plan is the plan. And this is in the plan. And my second question is on the separation of standard and non-standard measures, which you say is an important principle at the ECB. You can not uphold this separation only to a certain extent. If you flood markets with money, of course it will affect money market rates, and even if you increase your interest rates, you might still have an effect from non-standard operations. So the question is: to what extent is it really possible to separate the two areas? Let me answer the second question first. As already said we have a strong separation principle. The non-standard measures have to be commensurate with what we are observing on the market, namely to help the transmission of our monetary policy to function better again. So, they have to be commensurate. If we were flooding the market with liquidity, we would not be observing what we are seeing for M1, M2 and M3. This is absolutely clear. And again, the standard measures are there to deliver price stability in the medium term. On your first question, I must confess that I am amazed by the question itself. What we are saying when we speak of “automaticity” is, in particular, that the excessive deficit procedure should start as automatically as possible in order to avoid interference, with all the considerations involved, which has proved in the past to be extremely counterproductive. And again, I don’t want to tell you how disappointed we were by the attitude of governments in 2004 and 2005 and the extent to which we expressed our grave concern at the time and the extent to which we have been vindicated in our judgement at the time by what has happened since then. We are in exactly the same position; we fear that with the reasoning being too short-term, we will miss out on what is necessary in the longer term. It is a work in progress. It is being examined at the level of the European Parliament. As I have said, we are also counting on the Parliament to send this message to national governments. Automaticity as regards private sector involvement is absolutely counterproductive. We have a global doctrine in this regard. If the Europeans were inventing a doctrine for Europe which put Europe in a vulnerable position by comparison with the rest of the world, this would be a very bad move. By the way, this has been avoided, because the doctrine adopted by European governments – which has been made public – sticks to the global doctrine, the IMF doctrine. And the second question is: in recent weeks there have been some differences between the ECB and the Deutsche Bundesbank. The ECB said it would support the EFSF if it were to buy government bonds, while the Bundesbank was strictly opposed to this. How many national central banks in the Eurosystem support your view and how many support that of the Bundesbank? And did you discuss this issue? As regards your second question, there is only one ECB and one Governing Council of the ECB, full stop. That being said, by definition, I hold to the position of the ECB and to the position of the Governing Council, and that position is “kristallklar”. You can check yourself, but to my knowledge, no other central bank has said that it is against the position adopted by the Governing Council – but this has to be checked, of course. You are better informed than I am. As regards your first question Commissioner Rehn is invited, as you know, to all our meetings and we are very happy when he is there. Jean-Claude Juncker is also invited to all our meetings. They attend the meetings of the Governing Council as I do attend the meetings of the Eurogroup, and, when invited, the meetings of the European Council. We are fiercely independent as everybody knows. So, the response to your question is: there is no change in the relationship that we have with the Commission or with the governments. Our message is the same for all countries and it is clear: be ahead of the curve when dealing with your macro policies, with your fiscal policies and with your structural reforms. The message is the same for all countries and particularly for those countries which are in a situation of tension. To sum up our message, it is that you have to put yourself in the best possible situation because everything relies upon the governments themselves. The issues we are speaking about are associated with the signature of governments themselves and so governments should do their own job as well as possible, apply and implement fully what they are committed to do and be ahead of the curve. It is a message for governments collectively, which brings us back to what we have already said about governments, both individually and collectively. Thank you for your assessment of the influence of the central bank. I appreciate it enormously. I do not deny that we might have influence when we meet in the various “Gs”, including in the G20 and in the international meetings. The stakes are enormous and inflation at a global level – not only at the level of the euro area – as well as the stability and prosperity of the global economy depend very much on these prices being appropriate. But one should never over-assess one’s own influence. Again, I do not deny that we exist as an international partner and we have a lot of communication channels, including in the central bank constituency. The second question, in this context as well, is: could you please elaborate a bit more on the emergency lending assistance that a few central banks are still using and using it to certain or growing degree? What is, in your view, the purpose of the Emergency Lending Assistance (ELA) and how could it be constrained or contained in a certain way? I already said as regards the persistent bidders, when we have a decision we will make it public. On ELA, again, we have a concept, we have a doctrine, and we apply this doctrine. We are obviously in circumstances that are exceptional, which are a consequence of the crisis that unfolded in 2007 and 2008. We will see what happens in the future. As regards the past, I think that there has been some communication on this also in Ireland, because it was associated with a transfer between two institutions. I have no particular comment on that. This information was not examined by the Governing Council and I would certainly not draw any general conclusions from it. "
03/02/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council confirmed that the current key ECB interest rates still remain appropriate. It therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 13 January 2011, we continue to see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. This has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, very close monitoring is warranted. Recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. Our monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, and the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in the third quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence for the fourth quarter and the beginning of the year continue to confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area. Looking ahead, euro area exports should benefit from the ongoing recovery in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside, while uncertainty remains elevated. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in January 2011, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 2.2% in December. This further increase was broadly anticipated and largely reflects higher energy prices. Looking ahead to the next few months, inflation rates could temporarily increase further and are likely to stay slightly above 2% for most of 2011, before moderating again around the turn of the year. Overall, we continue to see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. Such pressure is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. These developments have not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, very close monitoring is warranted. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are still broadly balanced but, as already indicated in January, could move to the upside. Currently, upside risks relate, in particular, to developments in energy and non-energy commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years, and price pressures in the production chain could rise further. On the downside, risks relate mainly to the impact on inflation of potentially lower growth, given the prevailing uncertainties. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 declined to 1.7% in December 2010, from 2.1% in November. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also declined, albeit marginally, to 1.9% in December, after 2.0% in November. These declines partly reflect the reversal of special factors that operated in November and do not indicate a general weakening of monetary dynamics. Overall, however, broad money and loan growth is still low, confirming the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained. Looking at M3 components, annual M1 growth moderated further to stand at 4.4% in December 2010, reflecting the prevailing low remuneration of overnight deposits. At the same time, the yield curve has steepened somewhat further, implying that the attractiveness of short-term instruments included in M3 continues to decline compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. On the counterpart side, the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continued to conceal differences in the magnitude of growth across sectors. The growth of loans to non-financial corporations stood at -0.2% in December, after -0.1% in the previous month, while the growth of loans to households strengthened to 3.0% in December, after 2.8% in November. Taking into account the effect of derecognition of loans from bank balance sheets and looking through short-term volatility, the latest data confirm a continued gradual strengthening in the annual growth of lending to the non-financial private sector. At the same time, the latest data point to the overall size of bank balance sheets having contracted again after expanding for most of 2010, mainly on account of a reduction in lending between banks. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates still remain appropriate. We therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 13 January 2011, we continue to see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. This has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, very close monitoring is warranted. Recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, it is now essential that all governments fully implement their fiscal consolidation plans in 2011. Where necessary, additional corrective measures must be implemented swiftly to ensure progress in achieving fiscal sustainability. Beyond 2011, countries need to specify concrete policy measures in their multi-year adjustment programmes so as to underpin the credibility of their fiscal consolidation targets. Experience shows that expenditure restraint is an important step towards achieving and maintaining fiscal soundness, notably when enshrined in binding domestic policy rules. Such a commitment helps to strengthen confidence in the sustainability of public finances, reduces interest rate risk premia and improves the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. The implementation of credible policies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures. Substantial and far-reaching structural reforms, complementing fiscal adjustment, should be urgently implemented to improve the prospects for higher sustainable growth and employment. Major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. Increased product market competition and labour market flexibility would further support the necessary adjustment processes in the economy. All these structural reforms should be supported by the necessary improvements in the structure of the banking sector. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models remain key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. And secondly, on a completely different topic: we are ahead of another European banking stress test. The last one did not seem to have been such a great success as a lot of the banks that passed with flying colours, afterwards sort of sank without flying colours. Is there any advice you would put towards the supervisors and politicians that you might share with us? What might have to be changed in terms of the new banking stress test? I would say – to characterise the sentiment in the Governing Council – that we are very much in the same line, in accord with the assessment, that we had last month. It was only three weeks ago. We continue to see evidence that there are short-term upward pressures on overall inflation, mainly on the account of energy and commodity prices. And everything that we have seen over the last three weeks confirms that. As I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, these developments have not so far affected our assessment that price development will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. That been said, we have to remain alert. The continued firm anchoring of inflation expectation is of the essence. And, as you know, we have the reputation of always doing what is necessary to deliver price stability without being constrained by any pre-commitment. On your second question, I would only say that these new stress tests are being prepared in the best fashion possible by the appropriate bodies, and we are following that very very carefully – to the extent that we at the ECB are concerned. And then, on the matter of second-round effects: we have seen in Germany pay demands of up to 7%. Do you see that as being a clear second-round-effect risk and how would you plan on countering that? As regards your first question we will see what the staff says in its projections and I would refer you to our next monetary policy meeting where you will have at your disposal both the new projections and the assessment of the Governing Council that takes those new findings into account. What counts, as you know, is not immediate inflation, but inflation over the medium term. We have a definition of price stability over the medium term, which is the policy-relevant horizon. I would say that this is really what is extremely important in the present circumstances. But again, to characterise the judgement reached by the Governing Council today, we have come to the same judgement as a few weeks ago. We will publish the Survey of Professional Forecasters within a few days. We see clearly that we still have a continued anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium term, the medium to long term. I expect that, over the shorter term, we will have the impact of oil and commodity prices that we can already see now. As regards your question on the second-round effects of this phenomenon, what comes after the immediate increase in the prices of oil and commodities, we regard it as decisive, absolutely essential that there are no second-round effects. We have no way of correcting the immediate increases in oil and commodity prices ourselves, but we have the responsibility of avoiding second-round effects. As you know, we look at the euro area as a whole, so I do not want to comment on a country. But when the prices of oil and commodities are going up, there are always new threats of second-round effects that would be counter-productive, and this is the reason why we remain permanently alert. Second, the ECB did not buy any bonds last week and European governments are discussing the option of using the EFSF to buy bonds. Is that something you would like to see happen? And how keen are you to get this monkey off your back? In answer to your first question our decision on interest rates was unanimous. In answer to your second question, our Securities Market Programme is ongoing. We did not intervene in the markets during the period of five working days that were settled last Monday but the Programme is ongoing. As regards the decision that will be taken by governments in respect of the EFSF and, tomorrow, the permanent fund, we call for the utilisation of the EFSF to be as flexible as possible, and as effective as possible in terms of magnitude. My second question is on inflation expectations, which you describe as firmly anchored. Some consumer-based measures of inflation expectations from the European Commission are going up. Could you tell people who watch these things as well, what measures you focus on the most when you are talking about inflation expectations? In answer to your first question it is certainly not out of the question that the balance of risks might be different. At the moment, we consider it to be broadly balanced. It is clear that when we address the issue of the remaining uncertainty regarding the real economy, we are thinking of a possible global phenomenon that would be counterproductive in terms of real activity. We also consider the possibility of adverse developments in the European financial system stemming from the tensions that we are currently observing. This is a risk that we believe needs to be mentioned in the overall balance of risks for inflation. With regard to your second question, inflation expectations are a complex concept. We look at them from many perspectives, for example we look at what professional forecasters think, we look at what households think and we extract information from the markets. At the moment, we consider inflation expectations to be firmly anchored, but of course we have to be cautious and prudent. This anchoring of inflation expectations is also linked entirely to our credibility and willingness to take the appropriate decision on interest rates at any time. I do not want to comment on slight changes that we might observe when we extract information from markets as it is not really pertinent. But we have to remain permanently alert in this respect – something which is essential not only to delivering price stability, which is our primary mandate, but also to preserving an environment that is favourable to sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. Any un-anchoring of inflation expectations would immediately create an environment that would be less favourable to growth and job creation. It would immediately create an environment that would incorporate the unanchored inflation expectations into the market medium and long-term interest rates, which would in turn create a less favourable financial environment. And my second question is just on the Securities Market Programme. There have been a lot of suggestions that the 76 billion euro worth of bonds that the ECB has bought so far could be sold to either the Greek government or to one of the EU rescue funds. You have always said they will be held until maturity, but would I be correct in thinking – would the market be correct in thinking – that there is a price at which you would be prepared to sell them, I mean assuming that would be a price that involved no losses for you on the amount you paid? Could you clarify what your position is on whether the ECB would sell its bonds? On your first question, I would say the money market seems to be showing signs of better functioning. We have observed – it is not the first time I have said that - that the EONIA trading volume has been rising. So, from that standpoint, what we have observed in the most recent period has been a fluctuation of interest rates which was due to the fact that there is a better functioning market. But we also had some consequences of the requests for liquidity from the commercial banks. As you know, we are supplying one-week, one-month and three-month liquidity on a full allotment basis and we could see some technical factors recently explaining why the overnight interest rates were going quite high. The maintenance period was particularly short, which has played a role, and there was also the liquidity need towards the end of the maintenance period. So, this might explain what we have observed. But taking everything into account, I would say yes, we are seeing markets showing signs of a better functioning. That being said, it is also clear that we have a number of markets that are not functioning normally. That explains why we are maintaining our non-standard measures. I will not say anything on the decision we could take in the weeks to come, and in particular next time. We will examine the situation from all angles. Let me only repeat something which is very important for a good understanding of our monetary policy concept. We have the standard measures, as I explained at length last time, which are designed to permit us to deliver price stability; these are the interest rates decisions, the standard measures. The non-standard measures are designed to be commensurate with the abnormal functioning of some market segments. They are helping us to restore a more normal transmission of the standard measures. There is a separation principle between the standard and non-standard measures. To understand what we are likely to decide in the time to come, let me say that we will judge what is necessary as regards the standard measures independently of the non-standard measures. We will observe how the markets are functioning and whether our monetary policy transmission mechanism is functioning correctly and, if necessary, whether we should or not continue to help restore a more normal functioning. But again, it would be exactly commensurate with what we will observe at that moment. As regards your second questions on the Securities Market Programme, we have had no discussions with anybody and have absolutely no comment on the idea that you have floated. I usually do not comment on the functioning of our democracies. We have 27 exemplary democracies in Europe and 17 exemplary democracies in the euro area. Let me only say that Ireland has a medium-term plan approved by the international community, namely the IMF, and by the European Union, with the positive judgement of the Commission in liaison with the ECB. The implementation of the plan is absolutely essential, in the opinion of the ECB, for the credibility of the country. No comment on that. And secondly, you said that for most of 2011 inflation will remain above 2%, which implies that the ECB is going to miss its inflation target in a way. Wouldn’t you find this regrettable just in the year when you will leave the ECB’s home to your successor? On your first point, we always have a very strong message for all countries in Europe, without any exception, on the necessity to be absolutely credible in fiscal consolidation. We consider that fiscal consolidation is not at variance with the consolidation of the recovery, with growth and job creation on a sustainable medium-term basis, because fiscal consolidation brings about confidence, and confidence is the ingredient which is lacking the most in a number of economies. Very bold reforms – structural reforms – are also absolutely of the essence. As you know, we are calling for a “quantum leap” in the governance of the European economies, particularly of the 17 economies that are members of the euro area. This is absolutely of the essence and this is our strong position. From that standpoint we are not changing our language. We have the same language – we have only one language – which we have repeated very strongly, not only since the start of the crisis, but since the setting-up of the euro. And at times we have had to fight for maintaining, for preserving this soundness of our governance, particularly as regards fiscal consolidation, but also in other domains. As regards your second question the so-called “target”: as you know, within our own concept of monetary policy we have a definition of price stability rather than a target, which is: below, but close to, 2% over the policy-relevant horizon, which is the medium-term. We might have, from time to time, higher levels of inflation. We might have, at other moments, very low levels of inflation. We have observed that in the past. What counts is that we deliver in the medium-term below, but close to, 2%. That is our definition of price stability. And we will continue to do that with great determination, as we have done in the past, taking our decisions on interest rates without pre-commitment, without being tied by any pre-commitment. No, what I tried to say was exactly the contrary: that they were totally separated, and that we were able to do whatever was necessary in terms of standard measures, even if we had a different situation as regards the functioning of the monetary policy transmission. So, we take the appropriate decision on the interest rates; then we look at what is or is not necessary to help restore the monetary policy transmission mechanism as correctly as possible. It is a separation principle. As you know, we have observed these tensions in the prices of oil and commodities before the events that you mentioned. We are following the present geopolitical tensions with extreme attention: it is our duty; there are possible repercussions, and we remain permanently alert to the extent that it has an impact on our primary mandate and an impact on the functioning of our monetary policy transmission. At this stage I cannot say more, but we are looking at the unfolding of events with great attention. No, I would say that it is certainly an issue which still exists. And we are looking at it very carefully with the strong view that, taking into account all the different circumstances across the euro area, this addiction should be progressively eliminated. It is an ongoing issue. As you know, this Emergency Liquidity Assistance was decided by the central bank concerned. As far as the ECB’s Governing Council is concerned, we are looking at it to the extent that it has an impact on the overall functioning of our own monetary policy. The initial decision is not made by ourselves. The central bank concerned makes the initial decision. We look at its impact. As I said earlier, we are extremely clear that Ireland must apply the plan. The plan comprises a number of measures that directly concern fiscal policy as well as the measures on the Irish economy. It also comprises the reshaping of the banking sector. So, again, our message is: apply the plan! We fully respect the functioning of our democracies. I do not want to comment on our democracies’ procedures. I would only say that there is a plan. This plan has been approved by the IMF, by the international community and by the Commission in liaison with the ECB. Let’s apply the plan! That is my message. And secondly, I will have to go back to inflation again. You said your assessment has not changed since last month. I am wondering if that is the case, why did you change the Introductory Statement and for the first time you also mentioned that price pressures are discernable in the early stages of the production process in the euro zone? Is that not a sign of a slight rise in concern? As regards your first question you mentioned the euro crisis. Again we have to be very precise. There is no crisis of the euro as a currency. The currency has delivered price stability over the last 12 years with average inflation, as you know, of 1.97%. The credibility of the currency, namely that it will continue over the next ten years to keep its value and to deliver price stability in line with the definition of less than but close to two per cent, is remarkable. This is the solid anchoring of inflation expectations that I have already mentioned. We have a solid central bank and a solid Governing Council. We consider ourselves to be an anchor of confidence in the euro area. On the other hand there are difficulties for some issuers of sovereign bonds. That is clear. It is this set of tensions that you might regard as a crisis. Of course, this has consequences in terms of threats to financial stability. But, I repeat, there is no crisis of the euro as a currency. This is our judgment. There is very hard work to be done, to redress fiscal policies, to redress certain macro-policies, to engage in structural reform. This is the very strong message that we would like to send out. Ever since the creation of the ECB we have been an anchor of confidence, which is essential. As I said earlier, confidence is the most important ingredient in the present time. It seems to me that the global diagnosis on Europe and on the euro area has gradually incorporated what I have just said, namely that one has to consider the fundamentals. By that I mean the fundamentals of the currency, which has kept its value over 12 years remarkably and better than any currency at any time over the last 50 years, and the fundamentals of the consolidated economy, with its broadly balanced current account, a single economy with a single currency which overall has an annual public finance deficit which for 2011 is approximately half that of other major industrialised economies. All this is gradually being taken into account by markets. This is no time for complacency however, it is extremely important that the economies that have difficulties are themselves ahead of the curve in terms of their fiscal policies and their structural reforms. As regards your second question on our judgment of inflation, I confirm that we have to remain alert. I have already said that we consider that the anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Everybody knows that we will do whatever is necessary to preserve this. As regards price stability, may I invite you to our next meeting because then we will have the medium-term projections and will be able to assess the situation better. I have already said that we consider our current key ECB interest rates appropriate. We are permanently alert and will take the decisions that are needed when we judge them to be appropriate, with no pre-commitments. And secondly, is the Emergency Liquidity Assistance that Irish banks are getting adding to the overall liquidity in the euro zone system and are there any limits to what Irish banks can do with this liquidity? On the second question, we apply our own rules as regards the Eurosystem. As regards the supply of liquidity we also apply our own rules. And as regards the decisions taken by the Central Bank of Ireland or any other central bank in the euro area in terms of Emergency Liquidity Assistance, these are initial decisions taken by those national central banks. The ECB’s Governing Council looks at them and judge whether or not they are acceptable in terms of their impact on the overall functioning of the euro area. And the second question is: Although I know that you do not like to comment on statements by other people or authorities, I would like to read one sentence which is of a general nature and ask your opinion on this. The sentence is in the conclusion of the report and says: “We conclude this financial crisis was avoidable. Despite the expressed view of many on Wall Street and in Washington that the crisis could not have been foreseen or avoided, there were warning signs.” Would you agree with this or would you disagree? On the question of whether it was judged that there was very significant under-pricing of risks, under-pricing of spreads and underestimation of risk premia in global finance in general before the start of the crisis, even before the start of the financial turbulence, this was certainly possible. I am, on behalf of the ECB’s Governing Council a living witness. I made the point in January 2007 before the start of the turbulence, that we were observing general under-pricing of spreads and risks, general underestimation of risk premia and very low – abnormally low – levels of volatility in global finance. And I was reported having said that. So this was certainly the case, and I have to say that central banks more generally – particularly when they met in Basel – had this sentiment. But that being said, your other question was: “Was it possible to avoid the crisis?” This is clearly our working assumption. We are drawing all the lessons we can from the crisis at the global level, in the United States, in Europe, in other advanced economies and certainly also in the rest of the world, in the emerging world, with the idea that we could minimise the risk of unfolding of such a crisis through the appropriate strengthening of macro-prudential policies, through the appropriate improvement of rules, regulations, standards and codes in global finance, through the emergence of institutions designed specifically to look at systemic risk and macro-prudential policies - this is now the case, as you know, on both sides of the Atlantic - and through the appropriate coordination of economic and financial macro-level policies with a view to having macro-policies that will avoid imbalances and abnormally loose, unsound behaviour. This has been a dramatic crisis. It has been a crisis which has been the worst since the Second World War and could have been the worst since the First World War had we not ourselves and the other central banks – we were on the front line - not decided to act in a very short span of time, and had governments not also decided to adopt very important measures. So, what is clear is that we do not want that to happen again. We do not want authorities and the private sector to be placed again in such dramatic circumstances. This is no time for complacency either in the European Union, in the euro area or at the global level. We have done a lot of hard work, but a lot of very hard work remains to be done, and it would be an enormous mistake to consider that it is now business as usual, that with the recovery we can be again tranquil and not do the hard work I’ve been mentioning. It is true for the private sector. It is also true for the public sector. We have to be fully aware of this. It is not the case that, just because from time to time we are in more tranquil and calm waters, we should not be extremely active in delivering what is necessary. As I have said very clearly, I consider that the euro is a solid and credible currency with all the fundamentals to back up my argument. I will not comment on the statements of any particular head of state or government. I would say that, for me, it was very clearly the financial stability of the euro area as a whole that was being referred to in this speech. By the way, this is exactly what we ourselves were asked. The governments decided to step in, in the case of Greece, after having asked us, the Governing Council of the ECB, whether or not we thought that there was a case for governments to intervene because the financial stability of the euro area as a whole was at stake, as we said “yes”. We considered that the financial stability of the euro area as a whole was at stake. And my second question is: Do you think that the uncertainty that will probably surround bank stress tests might force you to delay your exit from non-standard measures again? On your first point I would say, on behalf of the Governing Council, that we all consider that we must remain permanently alert and that, again, at the present moment inflation expectations remain anchored, but we have to be alert. This is the position of the Governing Council. We were unanimous today in considering that interest rates were appropriate. As regards your second question the non-standard measures, as I have already said, will always be commensurate with the problems that we have or do not have. I hope there will come a time when we have no such problems, and when we do not have to help restore the correct functioning of our monetary policy transmission mechanism. "
13/01/2011,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Let me wish you all a very Happy New Year. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Estonia as the seventeenth country to adopt the euro as its currency. Accordingly, Mr Lipstok, the Governor of Eesti Pank, became a member of the Governing Council on 1 January 2011. Following the adoption of the euro by Estonia there are now 331 million citizens using the euro as their currency. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council confirmed that the current key ECB interest rates still remain appropriate. It therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 December 2010, we see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy prices, but this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, very close monitoring is warranted. Recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of economic activity, while uncertainty remains elevated. Our monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium term should remain contained. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in the third quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence confirm that the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remained in place towards the end of 2010. Looking ahead at 2011, euro area exports should benefit from a continued recovery in the world economy. At the same time, and particularly taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council’s assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty remaining elevated. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in December, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 1.9% in November. This was somewhat higher than expected and largely reflects higher energy prices. Looking ahead to the next few months, inflation rates could temporarily increase further. They are likely to stay slightly above 2%, largely owing to commodity price developments, before moderating again towards the end of the year. Overall, we see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, stemming largely from global commodity prices. While this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon, very close monitoring of price developments is warranted. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are still broadly balanced but could move to the upside. Upside risks relate, in particular, to developments in energy and non-energy commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years, and price pressures in the production chain could rise further. On the downside, risks relate mainly to the impact on inflation of potentially lower growth, given the prevailing uncertainties. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 1.9% in November 2010, after 0.9% in October. This strong increase is in part related to base effects and volatile factors. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also increased, rising to 2.0% in November from 1.5% in October. Looking beyond the special factors that operated in November, broad money and loan growth is still low, corroborating the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term should remain contained. The interest rate constellation continued to exert a significant impact on the growth of monetary aggregates. Looking at M3 components, the interest rates paid on short-term time deposits remained higher than those paid on overnight deposits. As a result, annual M1 growth continued to moderate, standing at 4.6% in November 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits continued to become less negative. At the same time, the yield curve has lately become steeper again, implying that the attractiveness of short-term deposits included in M3 has declined somewhat compared with more highly remunerated longer-term assets outside M3. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continued to increase in November, partly owing to special factors. At the sectoral level, this strengthening increasingly reflects the upward movement in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which stood at -0.1% in November, after -0.5% in October, thereby further confirming that a turning point was reached in the course of 2010. The growth of loans to households remained stronger, at 2.7% in November after 2.9% in October, but the latest data point to some signs of a levelling-off. Over the past few months banks have expanded the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment in which the overall size of their balance sheets has remained broadly stable. The challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates still remain appropriate. We therefore decided to leave them unchanged. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 December 2010, we see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy prices, but this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, very close monitoring is warranted. Recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of economic activity, while uncertainty remains elevated. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium term should remain contained. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, in view of the ongoing vulnerability to adverse market reactions, countries need to do their utmost to meet their deficit targets and put government debt-to-GDP ratios firmly on a downward trajectory. In this regard, the Governing Council takes note of the recently announced measures in some euro area countries to reduce their very large fiscal imbalances. Where necessary, additional corrective measures – preferably on the expenditure side – need to be swiftly defined and implemented. At the same time, all euro area countries should pursue ambitious and credible multi-year consolidation strategies. This will help to strengthen confidence in the sustainability of public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. Any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected economic environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. Substantial and far-reaching structural reforms, complementing fiscal adjustment, should be rapidly implemented to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. Major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. The removal of labour market rigidities would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation. Such measures are crucial for enhancing productivity growth, which is one of the main drivers of long-term growth. All these structural reforms should be supported by the necessary improvements in the structure of the banking sector. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models remain key to strengthening banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. We are now at your disposal for questions. And the other completely different story is, of course, that on everybody’s mind at the moment are the bond auctions this week in Greece, today in Spain, successful bond auctions and the bond-purchasing programme of the ECB. What is your idea, what is your stance on the discussions about an E-bond or about possible direct bond purchases from the Stability Mechanism? Could you please give us your opinion on that? As regards your first question on inflation: what we have observed is, as I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, that it is higher than expected and that it reflects increases in energy prices. Looking ahead, we feel that inflation rates could temporarily increase further and go over and above the 2% level before falling back to what we consider to be price stability towards the end of the year. That is our assessment. Naturally, it depends enormously, on the prices of energy and commodities. This is our judgement at present. We expect inflation to continue to be in line with our definition of price stability over the medium term – and over the long term. And, as I have already said, we consider inflation expectations to be firmly anchored. On that particular front, I would ask you to take note of three comments: My first remark is that we have made clear that we are permanently alert, that we are never pre-committed not to move interest rates, and our level of interest rates is designed to permit us to deliver price stability. And I can only remind you that in July 2008 we increased rates in a period that was not easy, because we judged it to be appropriate to take that decision in order to be able to deliver price stability. My second remark is that we have now had the euro for 12 years. The average yearly rate of inflation for the euro area over those 12 years was 1.97%. Not only is this in line with our definition of price stability, namely less than 2%, but close to 2%. I would say that it is – to be very clear – very close to 2%, but it is less than 2%. And this is something that is remarkable in terms of a track record. My third remark is that it is precisely when you compare our track record with previous track records, over the 1970s, 80s and 90s, of the founding fathers of the euro, the economies and currencies that merged to create the single economy with a single currency, that you see that our track record is better. And this is extremely important. We are in Germany, and I particularly want to mention this, but it is only one example among other countries that, over the past 12 years, the inflation rate in Germany has averaged 1.5% a year, and this is below what was observed in the 1990s when it was 2.2%, lower than the rate of 2.8% observed in the 1980s and much lower than what had been observed in the 1970s. I will not quote that latter figure here because global inflation was very high at that time. And I could go through all countries and the comparisons would all be flattering for us. But, now we have an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). We are responsible for Monetary Union. The “E” in “EMU”, stands for “economic”. The “M” in “EMU” has delivered exactly what we were called upon to deliver. I insist on that. We will continue to deliver what is required, in line with our primary mandate. And, with our track record, our fellow citizens, the 331 million citizens of Europe can have confidence in our capacity and determination to deliver and to give them price stability. As regards your second question on the auctions and markets behaviour, let me only say that we are observing what happens very closely. We feel that what is decisive is the credibility of the executive branches, the policies pursued in all domains – fiscal policies, structural reforms, and macro-policies, in general – and you know to what extent we encourage policy-makers individually and collectively to live up to their responsibility. On our Securities Markets Programme, let me only say that it is an ongoing programme and that I have no comments beyond that. You see what we have done when we publish the amount of our interventions every Monday. I will not elaborate on other measures. You also mentioned the Stabilisation Fund – let me only say that I have already said publicly, on behalf of the Governing Council, namely that we have sent the executive branches the message collectively that we are of the opinion that this Stabilisation Fund should be improved quantitatively and qualitatively. I am only repeating what I have already said – it is not a scoop. My second question is: investors have faced negative real interest rates now for some time – what does this mean for the policy outlook? As regards your first question let me only say that as regards our monetary policy, it is absolutely crystal clear that we will always do what is necessary to deliver price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. I have nothing to add to that. The position of the Governing Council is evident, as is the fact that we consider our present interest rates still to be appropriate. As regard your second questions I have no particular comment on the monetary policies of other central banks And the second question I have regards Ireland in particular. Have Irish banks asked for more emergency liquidity assistance since November? As regards your first question on the persistent bidders, it is an issue which we are examining on an ongoing basis, and it is a complex issue. We will continue to do all we can to discourage such attitudes. And we also have those particular banking sectors that have particular problems because of sovereign debt problems. As regards your second question on the non-standard measures, namely the full allotment mode, I have nothing special to say. As you know, we had decided to maintain this three-month full allotment mode as well as the one-month and the one-week. Therefore it is important that this is well understood: On one hand we have our monetary policy stance, we have our interest rates – they are fixed to be sure that we deliver price stability in the medium term. And on the other hand we have the non-standard measures, including the full allotment mode at a fixed‑rate, and we have the Securities Markets Programme in particular. These non-standard measures are there to allow the transmission of the monetary policy of the ECB to be as effective as possible in the circumstances. So: we take decisions regarding the non-standard measures independently from the decisions that we take in relation to the interest rates to help restoring a more normal transmission of our monetary policy decision, being commensurate with the disruption or anomalies that we are observing in some market segments. We are very flattered to be on your side and I don’t comment any more on the Glass-Steagall Act … The second question is on the European bail-out fund. Now if the EFSF is not expanded and the governments do not take the burden of bailing out the banks and this burden is left entirely to the ECB, then is this insolvency threat in this case becoming real? As regards your first question on the ECB, let me only say that the issue of a possible insolvency of the ECB is absurd. As regards the capital increase, we started with €5 billion, as you know. The idea that it would, after a number of years, be appropriate to go from €5 to €10 billion – more precisely from €5.76 to €10.76 billion – was already envisaged, in 2000, more than ten years ago, and was judged appropriate by the Governing Council of the ECB. We have a rule whereby we made provisions in our own institution at the level of the capital. We were at the maximum level of provisioning, so we thought it was time to increase the capital in order to enable us to continue to make the appropriate provisioning in view of the increased volatility of foreign exchange rates, the interest rate risk that we - and all central banks of the world - have, the increased volatility of the gold price and all kinds of risks, including credit risk, that we might have. This is, I would say, good management, sound management for an institution like ours. As regards your second question on the EFSF, I have already responded that our message has been and is an improvement in quantity and in quality, namely in terms of flexibility of intervention, of this fund. Second, if we are really looking at the rising economic divergences in Europe again, to what extent can you adapt your policy to really address these issues, in particular since we see a contraction in the periphery and record growth for 2010 in Germany. On the first question, I have said that, taking into account our economic analysis and our monetary analysis, we considered our present interest rate appropriate to deliver price stability in the medium run in line with our definition. We are never pre-committed, and we’ve proved that in the past by deeds and not only by words and by track record and not only by theory. So, it is important to have that in mind. This is the reason why our inflation expectations are very well anchored in comparison with a number of other inflationary expectations the world over. With regard to your second point on the dispersion of economic indicators - “divergences” as you said - I have said several times that there is in a very vast continental economy of the size of the euro area, or the size of the United States, more dispersion than, for obvious reason, in a small, relatively small or medium-sized economy. If I take, for instance, the lowest GDP growth and the highest GDP growth in the euro area on one hand and in the United States on the other hand in 2008, the lowest GDP growth in the euro area was -3.6%. The lowest in the United States was -3%. The highest in the euro area was 5.8%. The highest in the United States was 7.5%. If you calculate the difference between the highest and the lowest, it was more stretched in the United States than in our case. In 2009 it was the same. The lowest was -8.4% in Europe and -6.4% in the United States. The highest growth was +6.6% in the United States and -1.7% in the case of Europe. I don’t make the argument that this is something that is entirely comparable. We have countries and nations in Europe that are not exactly like the states in the United States and the number of entities is not the same. To take only some of the states or countries, I mentioned, Louisiana and Florida on the one hand are not Oregon, Utah or North Dakota. And, in our case, Ireland and Greece are not Slovakia or Finland. So, again, we have differences that we have to take into account as a normal feature of a very vast economy. That is not to say that I would “sing the praises” of the dispersion in question. In the past we had Germany going very slowly. I had to respond to a number of questions all over the world on Germany, wrongly called the “sick man of Europe”: “They have structural problems which are so dramatic that they will never grow!” people were saying. I have the memory of that, and some of the remarks were even made by wise and enlightened persons. So I responded: “They are working very hard to regain competitiveness. They are doing a very difficult job. They are working for the improvement of their competitiveness and making some structural efforts”. Now we see that the results are there and they are very impressive. Other economies were going very fast and had some kind of buoying episode which is now being corrected as it should be. And my feeling is that the gross divergences which peaked in 2009 declined somewhat in 2010. So, if you look at the evolution of this “standard deviation”, it has diminished in 2010 and we expect a further decline of this dispersion in 2011 and 2012. So we don’t see at the moment a deepening or aggravation of the divergences. On the contrary, we see some re-converging tendencies. And, everything we say to the different countries will help them to face up to the difficulty that they have. One of the by-products would be to reduce the divergences, because the consolidation of public finances in the medium term will progressively help reducing the divergences, because we have asked them to correct their loss of competitiveness and because we are also asking them to embark on structural reforms that will permit them to elevate their growth potential. Again, the messages are: It is not abnormal that a very large economy comprehends states or countries which have significant differences. I could have taken unemployment also, and you would be surprised to see that the unemployment level differences in the states in the United States are not that different from what we are also observing in Europe. Again, that being said, I don’t want to “sing the praises” of the dispersion. On the contrary, we consider that we are on the way towards less dispersion. Secondly, there is renewed instability at the very top level of the Irish government. Is this a matter of concern for you, given that the finance bill which gives effect to the budget has yet to be passed by the parliament? As regards your first question, I did not mention Ireland in the introductory statement. You might remember that we mentioned Ireland in our last introductory statement. We had said on behalf of the Governing Council in December that we welcomed the economic and financial adjustment programme agreed by the Irish government, and that we considered that the programme contains the necessary elements to bring about a sustainable stabilisation of the Irish economy. And we also welcomed the commitment of the Irish authorities to take any further measures that may become appropriate to achieve the objectives of the programme. On the interest rates, of the stabilisation fund it is the responsibility of the governments of Europe. And they have in their own hands this stabilisation fund. I would say our message is: improve the effectiveness of that instrument both in quantity and in quality. As regards your second question I will make no comment on the political situation. And secondly, as regards the stress tests, will they be conducted in February and be different from the previous ones? I think the liquidity standard should be changed; maybe you can elaborate on that if you have some plans? On your first question, everything is urgent in the present circumstances. And we are asking authorities in general – public authorities, European authorities and governments – to be up to their responsibilities, and this has been our message for months. So yes, I would say there is certainly a sense of urgency, and we call also for a sense of direction and a sense of responsibility. As regards your second question on the stress tests, this is something which has to be decided. They will be run by the appropriate new authority - in liaison with other institutions. We have our own role to play as ECB. And according to the new legislation, the ESRB is also in the picture. All that being said, it is work in progress and I do not want to comment on this work in progress right now. Secondly, why do you think that fiscal consolidation will reduce divergences in the euro area? It seems that the countries that are already weak will have to embark on larger-scale deficit reduction, and that would be something that would widen divergences. On your first question, it is not for me to comment in real time on what the market does or does not think. If you look at the evolution of the market, you would see that market sentiment can change every hour, every day or every half a day. So I never comment on market sentiment on a short-term or real-time basis. Our message for all countries, without exception, is “be up to your responsibilities and ahead of the curve”. This is not a new message. It is what we have been saying over the last twelve years. I need not remind you again of the time we had to fight to preserve the Stability and Growth Pact, and the way it was attacked by a number of countries and so forth. So, it is a long battle for us to ask the responsible authorities of the “E” in EMU, i.e. Economic Union, to be up to their responsibilities. This is essential and is true for Portugal as it is true for others. Everything depends on the capacity of all countries concerned to be “ahead of the curve”. Regarding your second question, fiscal consolidation makes it possible to regain the appropriate creditworthiness and reinforces confidence by clearly demonstrating to economic agents, savers and investors that things are going in the right direction. It is a way to correct what might otherwise significantly hamper growth. This is the reason why we believe that the decisions that have been taken will progressively help to move things in the right direction. But even now, looking at observations from 2009 and 2010 as well as the projections for 2011 and 2012, we can already see a progressive reduction in divergence across countries. Secondly, and just briefly regarding the responsibilities of government, you referred to additional corrective measures that may be necessary. Can we take that as a reference to Portugal and do you think Portugal should be accepting a bailout? On your first question, we took the decision unanimously based on our assessment that the level of interest rates remains appropriate and that we saw evidence of short-term upward pressure, but that we thought that, in the medium run, price stability would be in line with our definition. We were unanimous on all of this. I do not comment on the profile of expected market interest rates. It changes constantly. In any case, the market knows that, as we have proved in the past, including in July 2008, we take the decisions that we trust are appropriate to deliver price stability and it is the judgement of the market participants that trust that we will deliver. We might have to do this or that in the future, but I do not confirm anything. I would say we will do whatever is necessary and we are not pre-committed as you know. As regards your second question on government responsibilities, we consider them to be absolutely fundamental. I will not comment further on Portugal. I have already said, and it applies to all other countries, being ahead of the curve is absolutely essential. And my second question would be, if we can go back to the banks that are dependent on ECB funding, I would like to get a little more flavour of what sort of options you are discussing. Do you think it would be a good idea to have some sort of Europe-wide “bad bank” which would take bad debt off commercial banks’ balance sheets? On your first question, let me say again that all our non-standard measures are there to help restore a more correct transmission of our monetary policy stance. We are at present still in a difficult situation as regards financial markets. That is not particular to us, as you know. The non-standard measures are also important in the United States, in Japan, and in the United Kingdom in particular. In our case, we have been clear from the very beginning that we were disconnecting the monetary policy stance from the non-standard measures. The monetary policy stance is there to deliver price stability. The non-standard measures are there to help the transmission of the standard measures in the best way possible in the circumstances. And I would not say more than that. It is true for the full allotment mode that is still in place, it is true for the Securities Market Programme which is ongoing. As regards your second question on the options for the banks, I would say that this is already an old story. We had to cope with all these issues a long time ago at the level of the world as a whole, at least in the advanced economies and in Europe. I have no comment at this stage on any new spectacular pan-European measures such as those you mentioned. And secondly, on the comparison between divergences in the euro zone and in the US, the big difference between the two is that the US is a country with a government, a federal budget and transfers which we only have to very limited extent in Europe. So I wanted to know whether you are happy with the emergence of better euro zone governance that will provide some of what the United States already has, or not? On your first question I would say that we do not see any dilemma. We have never changed our position. Monetary policy stance, interest rates – they are there to allow us to deliver price stability and to be credible in that delivery. As I have mentioned a number of times, when we decided to increase rates at the end of 2005, we had ten governments publicly urging us not to increase rates. We also refused to decrease rates in 2004 although we had the three heads of government of the major countries in the euro area asking us publicly to decrease rates. We were at 2%; the United States was at 1%. We refused to decrease rates. And July 2008, as I have already mentioned, we increased rates. In 2007, in the period of the start of financial turbulences we were the first to embark on non-standard measures, on 9 August 2007. So there is no problem, there is no dilemma; we do not see a dilemma in terms of hampering growth. Because again, what would be the most dramatic way to hamper growth? In our understanding, it would be to un-anchor inflationary expectations because that would immediately and by definition be transmitted to market interest rates due to the very functioning of the market. So we see no dilemma. We will do whatever we have to do. I would not say that we regard the situation quietly and with great tranquillity. We consider that we will deliver price stability in the medium run and that the present interest rates are appropriate, but we have said that very close monitoring of price developments is warranted and we are on permanent alert as always. As regards your second question on the US economy, we rely very much on the judgement and assessment of the Federal Reserve. What I can say, and not regarding the United States in particular, but with regard to the global economy as a whole, and us, practically all the hard data and facts and figures that we have observed since the start of the recovery (for us this was in the third quarter of 2009 and in sync with the global recovery) have been better than expected. You have to correct a little, perhaps here and there, there was a slight disappointment. I do not want to mention any particular economy in Europe, but it is obvious that some economies are behaving very properly. If I take the recent Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and the European Commission survey of the industrial sector, we have seen improvements, and I expect that the hard data to come will confirm the soft data suggesting that production was quite good. There have been questions in past press conferences on whether we considered the double-dip an important risk and I was relatively prudent, but positive. As you can see, the observations we have made since then have confirmed that the recovery is there and has continued to see its momentum confirmed. I have already said what I think as regards the EFSF, and we will see what the governments themselves decide. I have nothing to add to the comments I have made regarding the Securities Market Programme. We are asking governments – and this is one of the messages – to improve the EFSF in terms of both quantity and quality, meaning maximum flexibility in the intervention of the EFSF. I have only said that these two concepts are not connected. We do what is necessary as regards the monetary policy stance to deliver price stability and to be credible in that delivery. On the other hand, we have to address the disruption of markets, with particular difficulties in some segments of the markets, and the non-standard measures are commensurate with the difficulty we face in transmitting our monetary policy. There are four possibilities: we could withdraw the non-standard measures while decreasing or increasing the interest rates. And we could maintain or increase the non-standard measures while increasing or decreasing the interest rates. The two modes are not correlated. Non-standard measures and standard measures are not connected. Again, the economy needs us to deliver price stability. This is important, and it is dependent on our monetary policy stance and the transmission of this monetary policy stance. Indeed, it is not the same! Specifically I said the programme is an ongoing programme to help restore a better transmission mechanism. Full stop! That is our only goal. I never comment on any intervention, so you will find out what we have done when the time comes, namely next Monday. Each Monday we say what we have done in terms of volumes of purchases. But we do not comment on what we buy or on what we do not buy. It is as simple as that. That is our rule. I do not say that what the market says is right. I do not comment at all. We all warned that, taking into account the present level of the price of energy and commodities, we see CPI being above two percent and rising in the short term, before going down to be in line with price stability, i.e. below, but close to, 2% towards the end of the year. That is what we said. And that is why we have not changed interest rates today. We considered them to be appropriate because we consider that we will deliver inflation of below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Is that clear? Again, our goal and definition of price stability is below, but close to, 2% in the medium run. What I was mentioning was the “hump” in inflation, which is in the shorter run rather than the medium run. But we remain constantly alert. "
