2008-12-04,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Brussels. I would like to thank Governor Quaden for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by Mrs Lagarde, President of the ECOFIN Council, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 75 basis points. This step follows the two 50-basis point reductions in the key ECB interest rates announced on 8 October and 6 November 2008. Overall, since our last meeting, the evidence that inflationary pressures are diminishing further has increased and, looking forward, inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon, supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. The decline in inflation rates is due mainly to the fall in commodity prices and the significant slowdown in economic activity. Largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil, both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period of time. At the same time, while the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong, it has continued to decelerate further. All in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Since September, there has been an intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil. Tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector to the real economy, and the world economy as a whole is feeling their adverse effects. In the euro area, a number of the downside risks to economic activity that were identified previously have materialised, leading in the third quarter to a contraction of 0.2% in real GDP growth, on a quarterly basis, according to Eurostat’s first estimate. Available survey data and the monthly indicators for October and November suggest that economic activity has weakened further during the fourth quarter of 2008. Looking further ahead, on the basis of our current analysis and assessment, we see global economic weakness and very sluggish domestic demand persisting in the next few quarters. According to the December 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, a subsequent recovery should then gradually take place, supported by the fall in commodity prices and assuming that the external environment improves and the financial tensions weaken. Eurosystem staff project annual real GDP growth of between 0.8% and 1.2% for 2008, between -1.0% and 0.0% for 2009, and between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2010. These figures represent substantial downward revisions relative to the previous ECB staff projections for 2008 and 2009 published in September. Forecasts by international organisations have also been revised downwards and are broadly in line with the December 2008 Eurosystem staff projections. In the view of the Governing Council, the economic outlook remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty. Risks to economic growth lie on the downside. They relate mainly to the potential for a more significant impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. It is crucial that all parties concerned make their contribution to lay sound foundations for a sustainable recovery. For this to materialise as early as possible, it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making. This is the best way to support confidence. The significant measures announced by governments to deal with the financial turmoil should be implemented swiftly so as to help ensure trust in the financial system and to prevent constraints on credit supply to companies and households. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has declined substantially since July. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, HICP inflation was 2.1% in November, after 3.2% in October and 4.0% in July. The significant decline in headline inflation since the summer mainly reflects the considerable easing in global commodity prices over the past few months, which more than offsets the impact of the sharp rise in unit labour costs in the first half of this year. Looking forward, lower commodity prices and weakening demand lead us to conclude that inflationary pressures are diminishing further. The annual HICP inflation rate is expected to continue to decline in the coming months and to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Depending primarily on future developments in oil and other commodity prices, a faster decline in HICP inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year, mainly due to base effects. However, also due to base effects, inflation rates could increase again in the second half of the year, so that any sharp fall in HICP inflation should be short-lived and is therefore not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Consistent with this assessment, the December 2008 Eurosystem staff projections foresee annual HICP inflation of between 3.2% and 3.4% for 2008 and declining to between 1.1% and 1.7% for 2009. For 2010, HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.5% and 2.1%. The HICP inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards substantially in relation to the September 2008 ECB staff projections, reflecting mainly the large declines in commodity prices and the impact of weakening demand on price developments. In this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including market expectations for short and long-term interest rates, as well as futures prices for oil and non-energy commodities. In addition, the projections are based on the expectation of a decline in wage pressure over the projection horizon. Forecasts from international organisations give a broadly similar picture. Looking through the shorter-term volatility in headline HICP inflation rates, risks to price stability at the policy-relevant horizon are more balanced than in the past. Unexpected further declines in commodity prices could put downward pressure on inflation, while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed. It is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities. Turning to the monetary analysis, various estimates of underlying broad money growth point to a sustained but moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area. Monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing further, with some risks remaining on the upside in the medium to longer term. It should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since mid-September marks a potential watershed in the evolution of monetary developments. The most recent money and credit data indicate that this intensification has had a significant impact on the behaviour of market participants. Thus far, such developments have largely taken the form of substitution among components of the broad aggregate M3, rather than sharp changes in the evolution of M3 itself. The latest available data, namely up to the end of October, reveal a continued moderation of the growth rate of loans to the non-financial private sector. At the same time, for the euro area as a whole, there were no significant indications of a drying up in the availability of loans. The annual growth rate of loans to households also moderated further, in line with the weakening of economic and housing market prospects and tighter financing conditions. The data do signal an impact of the intensification of the financial turmoil on bank behaviour. Looking forward, more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement. To sum up, there is increased evidence that inflationary pressures are diminishing further and inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon, supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. The decline in inflation rates is due mainly to the fall in commodity prices and the significant slowdown in economic activity largely related to the global effects of the financial turmoil. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports this view. While the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong, it has continued to decelerate further. Hence, when considering all available information and analysis, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 75 basis points. All in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council considers it crucial that discipline and a medium-term perspective are maintained, taking fully into account the consequences of any shorter-term action on fiscal sustainability. It is of the utmost importance that the public’s confidence in the soundness of fiscal policies is preserved, with the rules-based EU fiscal framework being fully applied and its integrity being fully preserved. The provisions of the Treaty of Nice and the Stability and Growth Pact require a medium-term perspective and allow for the necessary flexibility. Automatic fiscal stabilisers are relatively large in the euro area and provide a powerful source of fiscal support to a weakening economy. Where room for manoeuvre exists, additional budgetary measures could be effective if they are timely, targeted and temporary. Turning to structural policies, the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook imply the need to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of the euro area economy. Product market reforms should foster competition and speed up effective restructuring. Labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions. The current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * And secondly, recent comments by policy-makers have suggested that a rate cut above 50 basis points might create a panic in the markets, so why have you changed your mind? On our second point, we did not change our mind, we took our decision today, there was no previous commitment. As always, we decide depending on the analysis that we are making on the basis of facts, data, all information available and the judgement, experience and collegial wisdom of the Governing Council. We are today 21 and we will be 22 as soon as next January. On your first question, we had a consensus to decrease interest rates today by 0.75%. We considered it was appropriate, taking into account a further alleviation of the upside risks to price stability, as I have explained. Our analysis was that we had a substantial, a significant further alleviation of these risks, and that, in line with our framework, taking into account our two-pillar strategy and the cross-checking between our two analyses, it was appropriate to take that decision. For the future, I will only say that we are never pre-committed and we always do what is necessary to deliver price stability in line with our definition of price stability in the medium-term, less than 2%, but close to 2%. All observers, market participants, investors know that this is the way we are operating. On the first question, it is very important not to confuse the words and concepts themselves. Deflation is different from disinflation. Deflation is a concept which means that you are in the presence not only of a CPI that is going into a very low position, including negative. It also means that the inflation expectations themselves are exceptionally low, or even negative, and that you have, accordingly, prices that will remain very low or negative on a sustainable basis. And this entails a number of consequences for all other nominal evolutions in the economy concerned. Disinflation is of a different nature, it means that you have headline inflation that is going down, including, perhaps, into the negative zone exceptionally, but that does not mean that the inflation expectations themselves are unanchored on the low side. They would remain anchored to what would be the appropriate definition of price stability in the medium term, and it means therefore that you have exceptional reasons for headline inflation to be, transitorily, very low. We have experienced a period when oil and commodity prices went dramatically, sharply up to levels that were absolutely unexpected only a few months ago, or even weeks ago. And then, from this very high level, they went down, and the base effects I have been mentioning explain why at one time, we had extremely high headline CPI, and why afterwards, precisely because of those prices going down, you have a very significant decrease of headline inflation. But that phenomenon should not be associated with deflation as I defined it earlier. We have also to take into account that it was very bad news that the prices of oil and commodities were going up and up as they did. It was very bad news for inflation, it was very bad news for growth, because it had a depressing influence which was considerable. Now, when the same prices are going down, it is good for inflation because we are back to much more appropriate price levels for commodities and oil. And it also has an associated expansionary influence. Of course, that does not mean that you don’t have a number of other factors that are going in the other direction, particularly due to the financial turmoil and all the financial difficulties I have been mentioning. All that being said, you could see what are our projections, the Eurosystem staff projections, and you could see that, as regards inflation, we see inflation for next year as an average between 1.1% and 1.7 %, from 3.2% to 3.4 % this year, so the disinflationary process I was referring to is very clear and will extend into 2010, as I said a moment ago. As regards the recovery, you see that for 2009, we have a range which is between -1% and 0 and clearly, we see negative growth, as projected by the Eurosystem staff for next year. Again, I have said that in comparison with the Eurosystem staff baseline scenario, the risks are on the downside for growth. And I have explained why we consider that the risks are on the downside. That being said, we will see exactly what will happen and we have reasons also to believe that progressively we will have the recovery that you were mentioning, but as an average for 2009, as you can see, the projections are negative, or between -1% and 0. That was for your second question. As regards your third question on what we do ourselves: as you know, we’ve been very prompt in diagnosing, as early as 9 August 2007, very serious problems in the financial and money market. We have taken many decisions and we are permanently looking at what is their impact on the functioning of the money market. We will certainly have an occasion in 15 days to look again and wrap up all of what we are observing. The situation is tense, obviously, and we continue to see tensions, particularly as regards the spreads between the OIS and the three-month interbank market, that are substantial. We are observing that on both sides of the Atlantic, on both sides of the Channel, so it is a global phenomenon. Again, we will continue to look very carefully at everything and see when and where we have to take action. Second, returning to Governor Quaden’s football analogy, some other central banks have been cutting rates fairly aggressively. For example, Sveriges Riksbank cut interest rates by 175 basis points this morning. So what is your response to people who say that the ECB football team is playing too defensively and that there is a risk of getting caught behind the curve? I confirm that we had a consensus for the decrease of 75 basis points and, second, as I have already told you on various occasions, each central bank does what is appropriate, taking into account all the elements that it has under its eyes. We trust that colleagues are doing what is appropriate, taking into account the shocks that they are experiencing, the structure of their economy, the flexibility of their economy and, of course, their own mandate and their own definition of price stability. Not so long ago, a number of our sister central banks had interest rates that were very significantly higher than ours. You could have said the same in reverse: that they were much too tough, or that we were too accommodating , but you know very well that it would have been a wrong analysis: we were doing what we had to do, taking into account the circumstances As regards your first question, indeed, as you point out, 75 basis points is the biggest decrease in the interest rate ever made by the ECB, but I would add that, in the space of a little less than two months, we have decreased rates by 175 basis points. This is also something that we have never done before and that has not been done by a number of European national central banks since the Second World War, before the euro was set up. So, you are right to underline that we are clearly in circumstances where, in our eyes, there has been a very considerable decrease in the upside risks to price stability in a very short space of time, and that is why we have taken these decisions. As regards your second question, I will not comment in any respect on what the market is predicting at a certain distance from now. We will do what is necessary to continue to deliver price stability, be credible in that delivery and to solidly anchor inflation expectations in line with our definition, namely below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. I will not comment in any respect on what we could do next time. Again, we will do what is necessary. At the moment of speaking, we consider that this decrease of 175 basis points in the space of two months, or less than two months, is exactly what is appropriate, taking into account all the available information. And on fiscal discipline: can you give us your assessments of the recent €200 billion package presented by the European Commission? On your first point, we are, as I always say, pragmatic. We take reality as it is, the situation as it is, and we have to be very careful when making projections. As you know, for the staff projections I have mentioned, the rules, i.e. the methodology that is applied, are very simple because we take the prices that are observed on the market at a certain moment and then we take into account the futures market. This is the methodology that is, to my knowledge, applied by all institutions. Of course, this does not mean that the futures market is a good predictor. So, we will see what happens, but it is very important that oil and commodity prices are at a much more reasonable level. This is extremely important because this is one of the automatic stabilisers that we have at the level of the global economy and at the level of its various components, including the euro area economy. So, everything that permits this market to function as smoothly as possible is welcome. And the spontaneous downturn in prices, as it is being observed at the moment, is something that is, to say it again, part of the automatic stabilisation of the global economy and we are badly in need of an automatic stabilisation in the present circumstances. On our second point on fiscal discipline, as I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, we consider the Stability and Growth Pact to be absolutely essential. We are a single currency area which has no federal government and no federal budget. And we are told by observers from time to time that we have put the cart before the horse because we have a single currency, but no federal government. We respond by saying that, yes, we have an institutional framework that is not a federal government, but we have the Stability and Growth Pact, and the cohesion of the euro area is very much based on the Monetary Union, on the one hand, and on the Economic Union with the Stability and Growth Pact, on the other. This is very important and I will not elaborate more on this because it is the fundamental message that we give. We are telling all countries that they have to respect the orientations of the Stability and Growth Pact and, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, that wherever there is room for manoeuvre, it can be used. Let us not forget on top of that that the various members of the European Union in general, but those of the euro area in particular, have already taken decisions with respect to the recapitalisation of their banks and the guarantees that they are giving to banks, as well as the rescue operations that have already been mobilised in some cases, as proof of their efforts. This is very important and we should not forget it. Nor should we forget that, when automatic stabilisation can be utilised and when there is room for automatic stabilisers to operate in full, we in Europe – in comparison with other industrialised economies – have a level of public spending as a proportion of GDP and a level of social safety net that is generally superior to what is observed in the other OECD countries. So, in terms of their volume, that makes automatic stabilisers more important in Europe – not only in the euro area – than is the case on the other side of the Atlantic, for instance. My second question to you is, just to be clear on this, did you discuss any other options, whether 50 basis points or 100? And then my third question to you is, does the ECB have the legal authority to engage in quantitative easing or some European species thereof ? As regards your first question on our primary mandate, there is a logical relationship between the primary mandate that we have and the other multiple objectives of the Union that are, without prejudice to the primary mandate, in the Treaty. It is that the primary mandate is a precondition, a necessary condition for sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. So I think that – and this on both sides of the Atlantic – we would certainly say that price stability, credible price stability in the medium run, is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. I do not think there is any disagreement on that. I said that our primary mandate is price stability, but I also added what our definition of price stability is, namely less than 2%, but close to 2%, in the medium term. And we consider that this definition of price stability, if credible, if solidly anchoring medium-term inflation, medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with this definition, is a prerequisite, a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation. This is the way we are looking at it. It is because we consider that there has been a considerable alleviation of inflationary pressures and of upside risks to price stability that we have decreased rates by 175 basis points over a period which is a very short period of time, less than two months. So you have the clear illustration of the way we are operating. Now, you tell me that we did perhaps a little less than others. But a number of the others that you mention had interest rates that were much higher, significantly higher, than our own interest rates a few months before. So if you reason like that today, you should have reasoned in the same fashion yesterday, saying to us “Why have you got such low interest rates? They should be higher”. So let us not compare what is not necessarily comparable. We are all doing what we believe is appropriate. And we are not exactly in the same situation. We were not in the same situation six months ago or four months ago, and we are not exactly in the same situation now. But we all consider that delivering and being credible in the delivery of price stability – and I have stressed our definition of price stability – is something which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation. On your second question, I have already responded. We had a consensus for 75 basis points. On your third question, when I look at the size of our own balance sheet, I see that there has been a big increase over the recent period of time, which captures the exceptional decisions we have taken over the recent period. As you might remember, we were the first central bank in the world to identify that we were entering a turbulent episode of the first magnitude and that we had to be active and expeditious in decision-making in those circumstances. Again, we will look at what is necessary at any time, which is what we have done in the past, including the fact that we are as we speak supplying liquidity on an unlimited basis at fixed rates on a one-week, one-month, three-month, six-month basis, which is a clear demonstration of the extraordinary decisions we have been taking. All this has to be fully taken into consideration. We will continue to look, as I already said, very carefully at the situation of the market, at the situation of the economy. And if new decisions are needed, we will take new decisions. But at this stage I cannot say anything else. And a second question: you said that loans had not dried up. On the other hand, we hear from France, or from Germany, calls for the European Union to speed up acceptance of plans to pump money into some banks that are over-extended, after which they will lend to the real economy. So is it a kind of problem of loans having dried up? On your first question, the Maastricht Treaty is the Maastricht Treaty, and the criteria are the criteria, and they will be applied. And, to my knowledge, absolutely nobody – irrespective of whether in the Commission or the Council, and certainly not in the ECB – has asked or is envisaging to change the rules and to change the criteria for entry into the euro area. On the timely, targeted, temporary fiscal measures, these are also the qualifications that I use myself, as are – to my knowledge – used by the Commission and by the Council. So, we are all using the same qualifications. As regards your second question on loans I would take advantage of your question to mention that we consider it extremely important at this stage that the decisions that have been taken at the level of the governments, and I have to say that we ourselves called for those bold decisions to be taken, in particular the possibility of recapitalisation, the possibility of granting guarantees, is something that is very important to implement as soon as possible. This has been announced. It is perfectly legitimate that it is examined with care by the Commission – it is its duty to do so. We ourselves contributed to this and I have to thank the Vice-President of the ECB because he was instrumental in enabling us to assist in determining the appropriate pricing of those guarantees and the appropriate utilisation of those recapitalisation schemes. But now we have to deliver. It has been announced, it has been decided, so now it has to be delivered. And I am sure that the Commission will do everything that is necessary to ensure a very rapid delivery. I thank the Commission for this because we are in exceptional circumstances. I am fully aware that it is not easy – as we know from experience – to adapt to circumstances that are so different from what are – I would say – normal circumstances. But it is very important that things are delivered rapidly, because that will certainly help to bring us back to a more normal level of confidence. I think that a number of operators, market participants, institutions and so forth are still waiting a little while to see how things are implemented, to see if this “package” is really implemented. I can reassure them that it will be implemented, but rapid implementation would be most welcome because we are in circumstances which call for not only bold decisions in principle, but also for effective implementation. And, second, Slovakia will enter the euro area on 1 January – will the ECB introduce a rotation principle for voting rights in the Governing Council? On your first question: as I have explained, we have taken a decision that one of your colleagues has qualified as one of the boldest we have ever taken and I would confirm that. We decreased rates by 175 basis points in less than two months because what we had observed was an alleviation of upside risks of inflation. We think it was appropriate in consideration of the situation. As regards your second question on the rotation, we will certainly have an occasion to indicate where we stand. And it will be before the entry into the Governing Council of the newcomer, namely Slovakia, which will become a full member of the Governing Council as early as 1 January next year. Secondly, in the same vein regarding predictability, there is a bit of confusion in the market about whether or not it is actually possible for the ECB to make outright purchases of assets such as government debt or corporate debt. Firstly, is it possible? Secondly, is it being discussed? And thirdly, you have this interesting sentence in the statement: “there were no significant indications of a drying up of the availability of loans”. So, there is still no credit crunch? As regards your first question it is not my habit to comment either on a second-by-second basis or on a day-by-day basis. Had you asked the question yesterday, it seems to me that you might perhaps have said that the market and most of the economists were predicting 50 basis points. There are permanent changes in the market, so I will certainly not comment on such things. Again, I will say nothing about January. We are in a situation where we are never pre-committed. We will see what happens in January, but let us not forget that we have already decreased our policy rate by 175 basis points in a very short space of time, which is unprecedented not only for the ECB, but also for those national central banks that are the “parents” of the ECB, in the period since the Second World War. So, we have to take that into account, and we have to observe what is going on now. We ourselves have decreased our rates by 175 basis points. Is that being channelled through all the various channels that are in operation? What about the spreads I have been talking about? What about the EURIBOR I have been talking about? What is going on? We have to work on that and we have to be sure that what we are doing is really effective, and that is the reason why I insisted on the fact that the decisions that have been taken – not only by us but also by governments – have to be implemented as quickly as possible, including the guarantees, including the recapitalisation. And that calls for all parties concerned to be very effective and efficient in working on that. As regards your second question on the outright purchases, I think it is possible. Again, I will say that at this stage I have no further indications to give. We are looking at the situation as cautiously and attentively as possible. What we are doing through our present weaponry – namely the provision of liquidity on an exceptionally forthcoming basis; namely the fact that our overall collateral framework has also been amended in order to be extremely forthcoming; and you will remember that we were more forthcoming than all of our sister central banks at the very beginning of the turmoil – all that must be taken into account. On your third question on loans, it is clear that our bank lending surveys are indicating that there is a general toughening of the lending standards. That is a message that we have received regularly over the last few surveys. We can clearly see, particularly since mid-September, as I have already said, that we have had a big change in the overall attitude of a number of institutions, and there are a number of signs that are indicating that attitudes have hardened. On the other hand, you can see, because they have been published, the figures that we have in front of us. So, if we look at the growth rate of outstanding loans to non-financial corporations, we see 11.9% in October. That comes after 12.2% in September. So, there is a slight decline in this rate of growth, but it remains very impressive. For a number of months I have said that we have to take these figures with a pinch of salt. This is something which is complex, which might incorporate elements such as increased drawing on previously agreed credit lines, a number of phenomena relating to decisions already taken, or the use of loans to replace securities, which are enormously difficult to issue now because of the illiquidity of a number of markets. So we have to look at this very carefully. But the figures are the figures, and we have them in front of us. I remain very prudent, very cautious in this respect. We have to do all that is possible in order to get the money market functioning normally again, to get commercial banks granting loans and credit normally again. And we call on them to take fully into account all that has been decided already, which will be implemented as soon as possible by authorities. Question (translation): You have mentioned the financial turmoil a lot. Could we say today that the worst is over? You also explained very clearly the difference between deflation and disinflation. Do you think that we are closer to the risk of deflation, because the confidence of households is low, isn’t it? Trichet (translation): As regards your first question, we are facing a significant market correction. We were the first ones really to diagnose it. This correction is occurring before our very eyes, with some peaks such as the one we witnessed in September. In such exceptional circumstances, courageous decisions are certainly required from central banks and governments as well. I think that this is the best analysis I can give of what we can see around us. As regards your second question on the difference between deflation and disinflation, this is an important distinction, which I hope I made clear. One should not confuse these two concepts, as some tend to do. However, if we look at the CPI and the nominal data which are available, I do not think that we are in a deflationary period today. Also, our definition of medium-term price stability of below, but close to, 2% is not a novelty: it has been valid ever since I became President of the ECB. The two questions seem to me to be related to the spreads between the overnight index swap rate and the various EURIBOR interest rates. What is important is that we probably have a combination of liquidity-hoarding by the commercial banks, by the participants in this particular market, and of credit risk assessment, as well as perhaps some other premia that have also to be taken into consideration. It is a complex and a very new phenomenon. It should also be noted that the same phenomenon can be seen in all the major market places. So, it is a global phenomenon, despite the fact that central banks are making exceptional efforts through the various means that are adapted to our various situations, various economies and also various central bank armouries. We have to continue to analyse the situation and do whatever we can to diminish these spreads that we consider abnormal. And, after the measures we have already taken, namely a 175 basis point decrease in a very short time span, it is appropriate that we should ensure that this is fully transmitted to the real economy. Again, it is a significant phenomenon and one that is global. We have to see to what extent commercial banks, in particular, are in a situation which is exceptionally difficult. If they had not been in an exceptionally difficult situation, we would not have done all that we have done, and the governments would not have done all that has been done. Of course, we did all that, because the banking sector plays a systemic role in the economy and it is in the interests of the economy as a whole, of workers and employees everywhere, in all our economies, in the interests of all businesses. It is vitally important that we get back to normal as rapidly as possible. That being said, the worst possible attitude would be to make anybody a scapegoat. All institutions have to cope with exceptionally difficult situations, and it seems to me that it is up to all of us to be up to our responsibilities – the private sector as well as the public sector. As far as the public sector is concerned, we have to deliver what has been promised, decided and voted in many cases by parliaments. That is very important and essential. Part of our difficulty to get back to normal comes from the fact that a number of things that have been mentioned or announced are not yet operational and that is important. For the commercial banks and the private sector in general, I would say be up to your responsibilities and take fully into account all that has been decided and will be implemented. And secondly, the Swedish central bank in its statement today said they expected to maintain interest rates at the low level for quite some time. I know you don’t give a forward path of interest rates, but the idea that there is a natural base below which interest rates should not fall – is that a concept which you would share, or would you perhaps agree that in these exceptional circumstances, when markets are not functioning, you need to cut further and faster to compensate for the disfunctioning of the markets? On your first question, I repeat that we had a consensus for 75. On your second question, as I said, we consider at this stage that it is important that we ensure that the 175 basis point decrease that we have already decided is effective, in terms of going through the various channels and going to the real economy. So, in a way, this is something that explains perhaps why I do not say anything on January, for instance. Again, we have to concentrate at this stage on getting what we have already decided really operational. On the other part of your question, i.e. do we have the feeling that there is a limit to the decrease in rates? At this stage, certainly, yes. We have to beware of being trapped at nominal levels that would be much too low. It seems to me that it is certainly something which we have in mind and we will have to examine that and reflect on that. But as you know, we do not pre-commit, we have no path for the medium-term and, again, we have one needle in our compass. I always stress that in whatever circumstances, and circumstances can be extraordinarily different. We will deliver what is necessary in our eyes and to the best of our judgement, information and experience, to deliver price stability in line with our definition and our definition is less than 2%, but close to 2% in the medium term. I have already responded that it was the appropriate rate cut, that it was obviously an important one, and by all measures it was what we had to do in the view of the Governing Council. We will look at all parameters. You know that they are very numerous: you have in particular the EURIBOR on a one-week basis, on a one-month basis, on a three-month basis, the absolute diminishing of these various interest rates, and you have the spreads that have been mentioned between the OIS and the various term rates I have been mentioning. And we have a number of other parameters including the effective interest rates set by the commercial banks themselves when they deal with their clients. So all this has to be analysed very carefully. No, we did not discuss that. But again, a number of possibilities are being examined on a permanent basis. We are flexible. We want to be sure that what we are doing is entirely appropriate, taking into account the circumstances, which are abnormal. There have been changes in the circumstances, and our experience clearly indicates that we have to stand ready for new challenges. Again, on 15 September we had a new challenge, and we had to take the appropriate new decisions. As I have said, I will rule nothing out, but at the same time I am not pre-committing to anything. "
2008-11-06,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates further by 50 basis points, following the previous coordinated interest rate cut on 8 October 2008. The outlook for price stability has improved further. Inflation rates are expected to continue to decline in the coming months, reaching a level in line with price stability during the course of 2009. The intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil is likely to dampen global and euro area demand for a rather protracted period of time. In such an environment, taking into account the strong fall in commodity prices over recent months, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong but has continued to show further signs of deceleration. All in all, the information available and our current analysis indicate a further alleviation of upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, even though they have not disappeared completely. At this juncture, it is therefore crucial that all parties, including public authorities, price-setters and social partners, fully live up to their responsibilities. The level of uncertainty stemming from financial market developments remains extraordinarily high and exceptional challenges lie ahead. We expect the banking sector to make its contribution to restore confidence. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. When analysing current developments in economic activity, we face an extraordinarily high degree of uncertainty in large part stemming from the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil. The world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects, as tensions increasingly spill over from the financial sector to the real economy and from advanced economies to emerging market economies. In the case of the euro area, the latest survey data confirm that momentum in economic activity has weakened significantly, with sluggish domestic and external demand and tighter financing conditions. Looking forward, it will be crucial to lay sound foundations for a recovery. For this to materialise as early as possible, it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making, and to avoid second-round effects. It is equally important that the banking sector takes fully into account the significant support measures adopted by governments to deal with the financial turmoil. These measures should be supporting trust in the financial system and should help to prevent undue constraints in credit supply to companies and households. In combination with the recent broad-based falls in commodity prices, these measures should help to restore confidence. In the view of the Governing Council, a number of the downside risks to economic activity identified earlier have materialised, particularly those stemming from the financial market tensions. Other downside risks continue to relate to disorderly developments due to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures, as well as to the possibility of renewed increases in commodity prices. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn. However, it has been steadily declining since July, falling – according to Eurostat’s flash estimate – to 3.2% in October, from 3.6% in September and 3.8% in August. The continued high level of inflation is largely due to both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level. Moreover, strong wage growth in the first half of the year, in spite of a weaker growth momentum, combined with a deceleration in labour productivity during the same period, resulted in a significant increase in unit labour cost. Looking forward, recent sharp falls in commodity prices, as well as the ongoing weakening in demand, suggest that the annual HICP inflation rate will continue to decline in the coming months and reach a level in line with price stability during the course of 2009. Depending, in particular, on the future path of oil and other commodity prices, some even stronger downside movements in HICP inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year, particularly due to base effects. These movements would be short-lived and therefore not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking through such volatility, however, upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant horizon are alleviating. The remaining upside risks relate to an unexpected increase in commodity prices, as well as in indirect taxes and administered prices, and the emergence of broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour, particularly in economies where nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. The Governing Council calls for these schemes to be abolished. It is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rates of broad money and credit aggregates, while still remaining strong, continued to decline in September. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, monetary data up to September confirm that upside risks to price stability are diminishing but that they have not disappeared completely. A closer examination of the money and credit data indicates that the recent intensification of financial tensions has already had an identifiable impact, particularly in the form of outflows from money market funds and greater inflows into overnight deposits. However, the full impact of investors’ uncertainty on their portfolio allocation behaviour is still to be seen in the coming months. Both portfolio shifts between non–monetary and monetary assets and shifts between different types of monetary assets can therefore not be ruled out in the period ahead. Hence, such effects will need to be taken into account when assessing monetary growth and its implications for price stability over the medium term. There is also some evidence in the September data that the recent intensification of the financial tensions has triggered a slower provision of bank credit to euro area residents, mostly taking the form of smaller holdings of securities. At the same time, for the euro area as a whole, up to September there were no indications of a drying-up in the availability of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations. In particular, the maturity composition of loans suggests that non-financial corporations continued to obtain funding, also at relatively long maturities. However, more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement. To sum up, the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil is likely to dampen global and euro area demand for a rather protracted period of time. In such an environment, taking into account the strong fall in commodity prices over recent months, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate. At the same time, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong but has continued to show further signs of deceleration. Hence, when taking all information and analysis into account, there is a further alleviation of upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, even though they have not disappeared completely. At this juncture, it is therefore crucial that all parties, including public authorities, price-setters and social partners, fully live up to their responsibilities. The level of uncertainty stemming from financial market developments remains extraordinarily high and exceptional challenges lie ahead. We expect the banking sector to make its contribution to restore confidence. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. In the area of fiscal policy, medium-term challenges, such as population ageing, strongly underline the need for fiscal policy to focus on medium-term sustainability and thereby build confidence. Accordingly, and as recently confirmed by the ECOFIN Council and the European Council, the fiscal policy provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact should continue to be applied fully. The fiscal rules are one of the indispensable pillars of EMU and the single currency, which must remain firmly in place so as not to undermine the confidence in fiscal sustainability. Finally, the current situation calls for ensuring the high quality and timeliness of statistical information on government interventions to ensure the transparent and accountable use of public funds. Turning to structural policies, the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook will require a significant degree of resilience from the euro area economy. The current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms so that countries may fully exploit the benefits offered by the enhancement of international trade and market integration, in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * The second question is, given that we are ahead of an EU Summit on the financial crisis, and more importantly of a global summit, what do you hope will come out of these in terms of measures?  With regard to your first question, the Governing Council was unanimous in thinking that a significant decrease in rates was appropriate in the present circumstances, where we see an alleviation of the upside risk to price stability. We discussed several options, including diminishing rates by 50 basis points and diminishing rates by 75 basis points. After having checked and discussed the pros and cons of the different options, we decided unanimously that it was appropriate to decrease rates by 50 basis points. As regards the future, I would only say that, as you rightly mention, we never pre-commit: we always do what is appropriate to be able to tell our fellow citizens that we will deliver price stability in the medium term according to our mandate. It is essential at this time for households to be confident that they will have price stability in the medium term. The next decision-making meeting will be an important one, because we will have the projections of our staff, and so we will then have the occasion to review facts, figures, data and projections. At that stage, we will again do whatever is necessary in order to continue to be able to say that we will deliver price stability. With regard to the Summit, it is an important rendezvous. At the end of this week, an important meeting of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors will take place in Brazil. There will be then a summit of the Heads of State and Government in Washington. I would say that this is work in progress, and it seems to me that a lot of directions have already been identified as being the right ones for the financial market. In sum, these are: more transparency; less short-termism; more elimination of what is pro-cyclical in the functioning of the present global financial system; a jump up in terms of risk-management at the level of all institutions concerned; and, last but not least, more discipline in macro-policies at the level of all major participants in the global economy. That certainly sums up the avenues that we would judge appropriate at this stage. Can you also give us a quick preview of the ECB bank lending survey, which I believe is coming out tomorrow, and also of the survey of professional forecasters? Again, as usual, we examine all the arguments. What is important is that we were unanimous in considering that the alleviation of upside risks to price stability was sufficiently clear to permit us, for the second time in less than one month, to substantially reduce interest rates. All in all, the decision to cut the interest rate by 50 basis points appears to be the right and appropriate one. I have to say again that we are never pre-committed, and we will see what is appropriate, taking into account the new information that we will become available in the month leading up to our next decision-making meeting, which will take place, as you know, in Brussels. As regards the bank lending survey, which will be published tomorrow at 10 a.m., there are indications of a continuing net tightening of credit standards, particularly for loans to enterprises, for which the tightening has increased significantly by 22 percentage points. It is clear that the most important reasons for the net tightening were the expectation of future economic activity and the industry outlook in general. These were the main reasons that banks gave us for this tightening of their lending. I have to say that, with regard to loans to households for consumer credit and for house purchase, there was some tightening, but this was significantly less intense than the tightening that we saw for enterprises. Again, all of this information will be published tomorrow, at 10 a.m. The survey of professional forecasters is part of our overall analysis of the inflation expectations, and it is one of the ways we have of measuring their anchoring. It is something which is very important, as I stressed on behalf of the Governing Council a moment ago. In our extraction of information from the financial market, there has been a very clear regaining of control over inflation expectations. To give you one figure that I think is interesting: if you take the bond market and you extract from the bond market, the indexed and non indexed bonds, the five years forward, five years break even inflation rate you have figures, for instance, that were, at the beginning of July, at the level of 2.50%, or even more, at 2.55% or so. At the moment we are at a level of a little bit more than 2.10%. So, a very significant reduction, and that is part of the overall sentiment that we have that not only upside risks to price stability have been alleviated but there has also been a significant regaining of control of inflation expectations, which is very important. From the last figures that I have given you can substract an element of risk premia that would give you a break even which would be very much in line with our definition of price stability over the medium term. We will see what our next staff projections will be. It is clear that, increasingly, depending on the “vintage” of the projections, indications from all private and public entities are that after the very recent intensification of the financial turbulence, in particular since mid-September, which marked a new episode in the intensification of the financial turbulences, the impact on the real economy is more and more important. Negative figures for growth in 2009 are gradually appearing. But we will see exactly what we have in the projections when we look at them in one month’s time. Markets are currently pricing in, at the minimum, another 25 basis point reduction in December. You have, in the past, actually commented on one month forward expectations, so, given your desire to be predictable, I wonder if you would do that again. Thirdly, although the Euribor rates have come down, the spreads between the Euribor and the OIS rates have not, in fact, narrowed, despite the ECB’s bevy of money market operations. Is that a disappointment? On the future decision – again – we are never pre-committed. We just decreased rates today by 50 basis points. We had decreased rates less than a month ago by 50 basis points and everybody can see that why we took these important decisions. Future decisions will depend on our own judgment based on facts, figures and data. I do not exclude that we could decrease rates again. That being said we are not pre-committed in any respect: we will do whatever is necessary to take into account the situation as it will unfold progressively and to take into account the fact that, in any case, we have to be – my colleagues and myself in the Governing Council – able, at any time, to continue to tell our fellow citizens: “you can have confidence; we will deliver price stability in the medium term”. And the fact that I am able to say, on behalf of the Governing Council, that we could have the headline inflation in line with our definition of price stability next year is something which is very important, for the confidence of our fellow citizens. As regards the tensions in the money market and the fact that some spreads, including between the three-month Euribor interbank deposit and the OIS, for instance, are at a level which remains significant, I would say that we have taken very important decisions in particular as regards the supply of liquidity on an unlimited basis and at fixed rates. I would also say, as I said in the introductory remarks, on behalf of the Governing Council, that we have also noted the very important decisions which have been taken by governments and all this has paved the way for these tensions to be alleviated. I asked the commercial banks which make up this market to be up to their own responsibility, fully taking into account what we have decided here, what the governments have decided and to reflect those very important decisions in the behaviour of the interbank market and, of course, the Euribor. Again, we are in market economies; these decisions are based on the decentralised decisions taken by market participants and, in this case, banks. But I ask them, on behalf of the Governing Council, to be fully up to their own responsibility in the present circumstances. My second question to you is whether in the process of lowering interest rates there is a virtue in frontloading lower interest rates, or is that what you are trying to do right now in light of the fact that the slowdown was similarly rapid. And my third question to you, just to follow up, you said three times that you expect the banks to live up to their responsibilities and you repeated it a fourth time in your response to the last question. That sounds almost like a threat: live up to your responsibility or else what? What exactly are you trying to convey here? On your first question, we are totally pragmatic, we look at facts and figures and we have to be very clear on the words and what they mean. We see a disinflation process at stake, and it is visible because we see headline inflation going down, even if it is still at the level of 3.2%, which is substantially higher than our definition of price stability. But when we look at other indications, at the monetary aggregates, they are obviously growing quite fast. Of course, we have to look at the new figures extremely carefully, taking into account the fact that we have been living in a different universe since the 15th of September. Nevertheless, when we look at the increase in all these components and counterparts of the monetary aggregates, we see them continuing to grow, as a group, quite fast. Look also at compensation per employee and unit labour cost, for example. Deflation would mean a decline in a large number of nominal values. But when we look at compensation per employee, this was 1.9% in 2005 and 2.2% in 2006. If we look at the second quarter of 2008, it was 3.5%. If we look at the unit labour cost – of course taking into account the progress of labour productivity, which is quite slow at the present stage in the cycle – then it is even more striking. In 2005 and 2006 the increase in the nominal unit labour cost was around 1%, but in the second quarter of 2008 it was at the level of 3.2%. I do not want to tell you anything other than the fact that we are pragmatic and we will look at facts and figures. But we have to beware of straying too far from facts and figures. The facts and figures that the Governing Council has do not suggest a decrease in nominal values, which is the mark of deflation. But we will see how things develop and do all that we can to maintain confidence on the part of households in the fact that we will deliver price stability and do all that is necessary to permit financial stability to be restored. You know what decisions we ourselves have taken, which are historically extraordinarily bold, as well as the decisions taken by our sister institutions on all sides of the Atlantic, the Channel and the Pacific. Regarding frontloading, we do exactly what we think is appropriate when we think that it is necessary. We have just taken decisions that are clearly very important: two 50 basis point reductions in rates in less than one month. We have never done that before, but we judge that it is appropriate. We are neither frontloading or backloading or anything of the kind. We can act at any time to do what is needed, taking into account our mandate. This is the reason why we say that we are never pre-committed. Our position is that we try to do exactly what is needed at any moment in time, without being hampered by pre-commitments that could actually prevent us from doing whatever may be necessary. On your last point, there is no threat of any kind, there are strong encouragements. This is not the first time that we have encouraged governments to behave in ways that we judge to be appropriate from our own standpoint, or encouraged social partners or price-setters or now commercial banks. The second question: the Federal Reserve, in order to get the unsecured money market going again, has started buying up commercial paper directly from banks and also from corporates. Did the ECB Council consider such a move? And would it be possible according to the rules governing the ECB? We are in permanent contact with what I call the sister institutions, not only with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, but also with the other industrialised countries’ central banks and with the emerging economies’ central banks. We are in permanent contact, but each of us takes its decisions on the basis of our own analysis, taking into account our own responsibility. We do this in circumstances which by definition are never alike because we do not have the same economies with the same structure and the same flexibility, we do not have the same shocks to cope with. All of us do what is appropriate for our own economies in the present circumstances, and it is very important that central banks can demonstrate a high level of responsibility and an intimate exchange of views at all times. As regards the commercial paper issue, as you know, from the very beginning of the euro, we have had a collateral framework which was much more open than many others. Private paper in particular was eligible when it was not eligible in the normal collateral framework in a number of other central bank traditions. The decisions we have taken over the recent period have even extended the eligibility of our collateral. So at this stage we consider that our present framework is appropriate to help the functioning – and to foster a more normal functioning – of the markets, particularly of the short-term markets, in general. We continue to follow this evolution very carefully. First, just going back to the bank lending survey: previously yourself and other members of the Governing Council have refrained from talking about a credit crunch in the euro zone. Would you talk about a credit crunch now? Secondly, on this appeal to banks to make their contribution to restoring confidence, I wonder if there is any role you see the ECB playing, perhaps in terms of coordinating national initiatives to get the money markets working again – there had been a discussion about exchanges and things on the national level, but surely the ECB should have a role? Thirdly, a more general question, perhaps you could give us your thoughts on the art of central banking in these circumstances. Do you think it is better for a central bank which is facing a serious risk of undershooting its inflation target, should they be getting interest rates down as fast as they can, maybe by 150 basis points, for example, or is the role of a central bank to be more of an anchor for stability, not to be overreacting and to be exuding confidence and calm at these moments? As regards your first question, we see at the moment I am speaking no credit crunch, when we look at the figures that have been published thus far. That being said I am very cautious because, as I said, since mid-September we have had a very significant intensification of tensions associated, in particular but not exclusively, with the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Since then we have been in a situation where we have to be particularly attentive. But I cannot say that we are observing a credit crunch right now. As I said, on behalf of the Governing Council, we have to continue looking very carefully at all new data in order to have a more robust analysis and a more robust judgement. As regards your second question on the money market, it is absolutely clear that in the euro area we have a single money market, by definition, a single currency and a single interest rate: the EURIBOR is for the whole euro area. All members of the Eurosystem, the ECB itself and the various NCBs, would transmit the same message: that we have done a lot to permit the banks to be in a totally different environment, where the banks know that they have unlimited access to our refinancing on a one-week, one-month, three-month and six-month basis, and that they have a collateral framework that has been enlarged. They are in a totally different environment in comparison with what existed before. The governments of the euro area as well as the governments of the EU took themselves very important decisions in a number of areas, including recapitalisation and guarantees. All of these elements have to be taken fully into account. I accept that it takes time to realise that you are in a very different new environment, and I also understand that there is a certain asymmetry between the decisions that you take to toughen considerably your risk management and the decisions that you take to get back to a more normal position. We encourage the commercial banks very strongly, through all channels, to take fully into account all the decisions that have been made. As regards your third question you know that the central banks are a brotherhood of mutual admiration which is very strong, with a very high level of mutual confidence. Each of us is in our own environment with our own economies, which have different shocks, different levels of flexibility, many different features. You cannot say that two economies are alike, and this is true on both sides of the Channel, on both sides of the Atlantic and across the Pacific. I believe that we are all doing what is required in the circumstances, which are exceptionally tense, exceptionally uncertain and challenging. I think it is important that we take up our own responsibilities, and that all observers see us doing so, and that we don’t hesitate to do things that we might not necessarily have done before. This is clear for all of us. The second question is: you talked about growth recovering over the course of 2009. Could you be slightly more specific? I mean, can we assume that it won’t be towards the end of 2009 in your view? Another question on the volatility of the euro in recent weeks. Are you concerned about that? And was there a discussion of, perhaps, intervention by the ECB? As regards your first question I explicitly mentioned two options. I would not say that no other figures were mentioned. Perhaps some people mentioned the figure “25” at a certain moment, but the two main options were 50 and 75 basis points, with the substantial difference being that, ultimately, taking everything into account, we were unanimous in judging that 50 basis points was appropriate in the present circumstances. As regards your second question on the projections, we will publish our staff projections and discuss the projections in general at our next decision-making meeting in Brussels, and all what I would confirm is that the main difference that can be seen in all the various projections at the moment – I am talking about all the projections; we do not stick exclusively to our staff projections ourselves – both in the private and public sector - is that the projections, as far as real economic growth is concerned, are more and more going down, depending on the vintage. The more recent the projections, the more they incorporate this intensification of financial tensions I was talking about and the impact on the real economy. As regards your third question on volatility we are observing on the exchange market – not only for us, but for all, absolutely all, currencies – a considerable level of volatility, which reflects the tensions in question. Clearly you have the phenomenon of repatriation of capital in the place where they are managed, and this is creating considerable volatility. I never comment on interventions, as you know. I expect you will ask this question again at our next meeting in Brussels, and I will be delighted to tell what we do next time. I do not pre-commit even on a very short-term basis. I will certainly not pre-commit on a longer-term basis. And on the meeting tomorrow – maybe you could give us a benchmark. What would you consider a successful meeting tomorrow in Brussels? As regards the Brussels meeting, everybody knows what is at stake and what we need to concentrate on as regards the present financial turbulence. And that’s all I would say. On the Swiss franc issue – this is of course the main issue for our Swiss friends and colleagues. And they are taking their own responsibility in a situation which is different from other economies. I have nothing particular to tell them and no particular advice to give them, but I am sure that they are doing what is appropriate. I think that of the many reasons why we are observing this bust phenomenon, which has followed a boom phenomenon – we have to be fully aware that after the boom you have the bust; these are two sides of the same coin – you certainly have an absence of discipline at a global level. I am not thinking of any particular economy, but I think that, among the lessons to be drawn from the present episode in global finance and the global economy, we have to take into account the need to introduce –through different means, a new framework, perhaps peer surveillance, perhaps other means – a way of avoiding the persistence of very large imbalances, both domestic and external. That is certainly something we are all aiming at addressing. This is easy to say, and much more difficult to introduce in the global economy with the real functioning of the global economic and financial system. I think that this is one of the issues that we have to reflect upon. And this is a long-term consideration. I am not suggesting that the fine-tuning of the present situation through fiscal stimulus would be part of it. This is a totally different question, a totally different issue, one which leads back to the consideration of Bretton Woods itself. This is one of the issues that we are looking at very carefully. It is associated with the strong encouragement that I gave a moment ago for commercial banks to live up to their responsibilities. It is clearly not normal to ensure large supply of liquidity, which, at the end of the day, ends up in our deposit window. So we are reflecting on the best way of improving this. I won’t mention any particular instrument. Perhaps the encouragement – the strong encouragement – that I mentioned earlier will work. This is my working assumption at this stage, but I’m not ruling anything out! And more on the short term, I am not quite sure I understand your position on fiscal policy. Are you supporting what we are seeing in the euro area in some countries, which are indeed trying to stimulate demand by more aggressive discretionary fiscal policy, or do you think this is a bad idea? This is the first time that we have had a very large episode of financial turbulence in the industrialised world itself, at the heart of the industrialised world, and we are particularly attentive to that. But we had previously great difficulties in the emerging world – for instance in the 1980s, when we had entire continents which were broke and bankrupt. I myself was Chairman of the Paris Club at the time, and at that time we had to cope with 52 countries defaulting simultaneously. There we had to see how to organise – or not – the rescheduling of their debt, because they had defaulted depending on the qualification of the conditionality that they were embarking on with the help of the IMF. We have forgotten that we have had very difficult episodes, not to mention the Asian crisis, which was also very dramatic. In most cases, you can see that there is something which is lacking in the global framework – an appropriate level of surveillance; surveillance ensuring greater discipline. And it is true for everyone. It is true for the industrialised world; it’s true for the emerging world. So, how do you do that? How do you reintroduce a level of discipline which seems indispensable in order to avoid problems at a global level? This is an open question. I won’t say that it’s easy to answer, but it has to be addressed. Otherwise, we will have more problems. As regards Europe, what the Governing Council of the ECB says is very simple: you apply the Stability and Growth Pact. Follow all the rules as they are. You don’t change the rules. You don’t change the Stability and Growth Pact. We are lucky enough to have a framework which is one of the pillars is EMU: Economic and Monetary Union. Monetary Union is the euro. We know what that is. We have a single currency and single monetary policy decisions that I am explaining at the moment. And we have an economic union. The core of the economic union is very much the Stability and Growth Pact. I would sum up our position in this way, and the President of the Eurogroup has publicly said exactly the same. We stick to the Stability and Growth Pact – all of its provisions as crafted in the last reform by national governments. It’s as simple as that. Why would it be bad for the rate cuts to be passed on? We are decreasing our own rates. It should normally be something that they would appreciate. If they pass on the rate cut, it will be neutral. They would be passing on the rate cut that we ourselves have triggered. It’s clear that the decisions which have been taken – not Ireland in particular; all of the governments that have taken bold decisions – are decisions which have been taken in extraordinary circumstances to allow commercial banks and the financial system in general to function much more normally. These are bold decisions, obviously, taken for very good reasons. And we ourselves are echoing these decisions. It means an additional effort, in terms of risk taken by Governments. And this is one of the reasons why I am saying that commercial banks should take full account of the fact that it is not just us. Governments too have taken bold decision. And these should be seen for what they are, namely decisions that increase the risks for the governments themselves and therefore decrease the risks for the banks. We are back to what I said earlier. We really consider that commercial banks have to live up to their responsibilities. What we are observing as regards the spreads on the market today illustrate the fact that, collectively, they have not yet done this. We do not want to have an economy which is a planned economy. We are in an economy which is a market economy and has to function as a market economy. But they have, collectively, to understand that they are in a different universe. I do not think that the index should necessarily be changed: we should instead see the EURIBOR going down to a level that takes into account all the decisions that have been taken. We are all happy to attend under the chairmanship of Brazil this meeting of the G20 at the level of Ministers of Finance and Governors. It will be a good occasion to look at the situation, compare notes, have a full global view of the situation, which, again, is not only the situation as seen from the industrialised countries, but also the situation as seen from the emerging economies. We will also have the opportunity to continue the work very carefully prepared by the Financial Stability Forum, looking at all the avenues considered appropriate for the improved functioning of global finance. So, I expect substantial added value from the meeting in Brazil. No. "
2008-10-02,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We discussed extensively the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil and its possible impact on economic activity and inflation, recognising the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments. In this context, we stressed the crucial importance of keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective. Price stability fosters an efficient allocation of resources, contains inflation risk premia and longer-term financing costs, and preserves the purchasing power of our currency. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. The most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening, with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. At the same time, annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time. With the weakening of demand, upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat, but they have not disappeared. While the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is showing some further signs of moderation. It is imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. All parties concerned face exceptional challenges and are called upon to meet their responsibilities Accordingly, we confirm that we remain determined to secure price stability in the medium term and will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. When analysing current developments in economic activity, it needs to be stressed that we face an extraordinarily high degree of uncertainty, in large part stemming from the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil. This complicates any assessment of the near to medium-term economic prospects. As the world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects of the intensified and prolonged financial market turmoil, the most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening, with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. The fall in oil prices from their peak in July and ongoing growth in emerging market economies might support a gradual recovery in the course of 2009. In the view of the Governing Council, the economic outlook is subject to increased downside risks, mainly stemming from a scenario of ongoing financial market tensions affecting the real economy more adversely than currently foreseen. Other downside risks relate to the possibility of renewed increases in highly volatile energy and food prices, disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, standing at 3.6% in September according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 3.8% in August. This still worrying level of inflation is largely the consequence of both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level. Moreover, wage growth has been picking up rather strongly in recent quarters, in spite of a weaker growth momentum and at a time when labour productivity growth has decelerated. This resulted in a sharp increase in the year-on-year unit labour cost – to 3.4% – in the second quarter of this year, after several years of more moderate increases in the order of 1-1½%. Looking ahead, on the basis of current commodity futures prices, annual HICP inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time, moderating gradually during the course of 2009. At the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, taking into account the weakening in demand, upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat, but they have not disappeared. They include the possibility of previous commodity price rises having further and stronger indirect effects on consumer prices, as well as a renewed increase in commodity prices. In particular, there is a very strong concern that the emergence of broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour could add significantly to inflationary pressures. Moreover, unexpected rises in indirect taxes and administered prices could occur. Against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. This is all the more the case in an environment of very high uncertainty. Broad-based second-round effects stemming from the impact of past energy and food price increases on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. We have repeatedly expressed our concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council calls for these schemes to be abolished. Turning to the monetary analysis, we need to recognise that the latest monetary data refer to the end of August and thus do not yet embody the impact of the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil. Further data on this impact will be carefully evaluated. As a general observation, previous episodes suggest that financial market tensions can have a relatively limited impact on monetary developments, but they have also been associated with large portfolio shifts and thus have exerted significant influence on monetary data. While the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, data up to August show that the growth of broad money and credit aggregates moderated over the past few months, reflecting the monetary policy decisions taken since 2005 to address risks to price stability. As a more detailed examination shows, the flat yield curve and the structure of bank deposit rates have led to a number of substitution effects. First, there has been a substitution from longer-term maturity assets into instruments covered by M3, which offer similar remuneration but greater liquidity and less risk. As a consequence, the annual growth rate of M3 probably overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion. Second, there have been substitution effects within M3. In contrast to the dynamic developments in M3, annual M1 growth has fallen to very low levels. This reflects relatively attractive interest rates for time deposits, which have increased the opportunity cost of holding cash or overnight deposits. Although, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions, the gradual moderation of growth in loans continued in the August data, as previously anticipated, with corporate demand for credit slowing. At the same time, the growth of loans to households continues to follow the downward trend observed over the past few years, as a result of higher short-term interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area. To sum up, we discussed extensively the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil and its possible impact on economic activity and inflation, recognising the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments. In this context, we stressed how crucial it is for monetary policy to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective. Price stability fosters an efficient allocation of resources, contains inflation risk premia and longer-term financing costs, and preserves the purchasing power of our currency. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. The most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening, with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. The cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time and, when taking into account the weakening of demand, that upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat, but they have not disappeared. While the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is showing some further signs of moderation. It is imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. All parties concerned face exceptional challenges and are called upon to meet their responsibilities Accordingly, we confirm that we remain determined to secure price stability in the medium term and will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, in the current situation of continuing economic uncertainty, it is essential that governments abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and ensure the sustainability of public finances. Maintaining sound public finances will enable governments to let automatic stabilisers operate freely and thus contribute to smoothing the economic cycle and to supporting private sector confidence. Turning to structural policies, measures that foster competition and flexibility and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance in the current economic circumstances. While moderate unit labour cost growth is crucial in all euro area countries, it is particularly pressing in those that have experienced a significant loss of cost and price competitiveness over recent years and where unemployment has already started to rise. Moreover, labour market reforms fostering employment and investment and promoting skills, innovation and efficiency remain essential to support growth and real incomes in the longer term. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * You are correct in your understanding of our judgement. We are observing a slowdown in the euro area economy and I said that this has contributed to alleviating somewhat the upside risks to price stability. They have not disappeared. In particular, I mentioned what we are observing in terms of unit labour costs increases in the second quarter of this year and I sent on behalf of the Governing Council a very clear message to social partners, as well as all price-setters, that we will not allow second-round effects to materialise. Our conclusion was therefore that we will continue to observe all developments very carefully. And my second question is: did you discuss your recent projections on economic growth, and if so, what was the outcome of your discussion? You talked about a recovery in 2009: do you still expect to see growing upside risks to this scenario in the light of the current turmoil? And did you get an update on the growth projections? As regards your first question, our decision was unanimous. We examined two options: first, leaving interest rates unchanged; second, decreasing interest rates. Our unanimous conclusion was that it would be right to leave interest rates unchanged. As I have said several times on behalf of the Governing Council, there is currently an extraordinarily high level of uncertainty. As always, I will also say that we are totally free to do all that is necessary at any time in order to be able to guarantee our fellow citizens that we will ensure price stability over the medium term. This, of course, depends on our judgement of the balance of risks to price stability, as well as the evolution of the situation that influences the balance of risks to price stability. On the second question, by definition, we have not changed our projections, which are the responsibility of staff and not of the Governing Council itself. I therefore cannot say that we have any new projections, but we are incorporating all the new elements stemming from the international situation, as well as from the situation in Europe, into our discussions. Again, I confirm that our judgement is that there is a visible weakening of economic activity and that the risks for future growth are on the downside. And my second question is: does the Governing Council have a greater sense now that inflation in 2010 will be at levels consistent with price stability? Since our last meeting we have seen changes, as I mentioned in the introductory statement on behalf of the Governing Council. In the judgement of the Governing Council, we have both the intensification of the financial turbulence, which creates a high level of uncertainty that we have to consider, and we have the weakening of growth. We have seen a reduction in the upside risks for inflation but, in the judgement of the Governing Council, while they have diminished, they have not disappeared. As regards your second question on the delivery of price stability in the medium term, in line with our definition, we consider that the mandate we have received from the people of Europe through the Treaty is to do at any time what is necessary to deliver price stability in the medium term. The medium term is the time which is necessary for a decision to materialise in the CPI – that is some 18 to 20 months. And I confirm that our 320 million fellow citizens can have confidence that we will deliver price stability in line with our definition in this period of 18 to 20 months – which means the beginning of 2010. This is a very important question. The solid anchoring of inflation expectations is extremely important for growth, job creation and financial stability for reasons that are very simple to understand. If there is an unanchoring of inflation expectations, then medium and long-term market interest rates will go up, whatever you do on the short-term side of the yield curve, and it would be detrimental to growth and job creation. There would also be considerable danger of price increases in the long run. The future inflation would be adversely influenced by these expectations and it is absolutely clear that for us it is crucial, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, to solidly anchor expectations. Where do we stand in this respect? I would say that thanks to the decisions we have taken, we have stabilised a tendency to have higher inflation expectations, that had been observed and which we considered a threat. And as regards the information we extract from financial markets, we have a stabilisation of the inflation expectations according to the information we extract from the swap markets. In particular, if we look at five-year forward break-even in five years. And I am happy to say that we see a good development of inflation expectations when we look at the information we extract from the bond market. We see that we have somewhat regained control of inflation expectations in a fashion which is now visible. Secondly, you have taken pains in the past to be predictable, notwithstanding never pre-committing: are you still committed to being predictable? And finally, the ECB generally has been extremely active in money markets lately and interbank lending rates are not showing signs of responding to so much extra liquidity, so I wonder if you can talk a little bit about that and tell us whether you considered narrowing the band between the marginal lending and the marginal deposit facility as perhaps another way of aiding the market? On the last question, no, we did not discuss that. On your first question as regards the wording of the introductory statement, let me repeat that we are in a situation of an exceptionally high level of uncertainty. It is a situation which we have never encountered before in the time since we were set up. The situation is clearly absolutely exceptional in terms of the level of uncertainty and, as I have already said, as always we are totally free to do at any time what we judge to be necessary to take into account the evolution of the situation in terms of the balance of risks to price stability. I stress that we have only one needle in our compass. It is the balance of risks to price stability. As regards your second question on the pre-commitment, as you know, we are never pre-committed and we do at any time what we judge to be appropriate according to the circumstances. The predictability is to be attributed to the extreme acuteness and lucidity of the observers. Second question, you talked about the acceleration of unit labour costs in the second quarter. Given the slowdown of the economy, how likely do you think is the scenario that this will affect price-setting, so how likely is the danger of let’s call it “third-round effects” in your view? On your first question, I will repeat that we are in a situation of an exceptionally high level of uncertainty and we are free to do at any time what is necessary. As regards your second question on labour costs, we clearly have a level of unit labour costs which is very high in the second quarter reading, much higher than what we observed one year ago, two years ago, and that is due to two phenomena. One is that the slowing-down of the economy has counterproductive effects as regards labour productivity. This is what we are observing in the European economy in general and in the euro area in particular in a period of slowing-down in the business cycle. There are also increases, nominal increases which are abnormal in our view and explain the level of unit labour costs that we see. Let me add that the Governing Council looks at the situation at the level of the 320 million citizens and 15 countries of the euro area. The situation in the various countries is not the same, and our message of moderation and avoiding second-round effects goes very strongly to those that have nominal developments that are, in our view, very abnormal in terms of nominal wage and salary increases, price increases and other nominal developments. This is something which is very important: we have a general message, but we also have a message for those who are moving up abnormally in terms of nominal developments. I’ll look forward to seeing you at the next meeting. It will be a great pleasure for me to tell you at that point in time what we have done. It was not to European leaders in general. It was in particular, with my colleague, the Governor of the Belgian central bank, to those who were directly involved in this particular matter. I transmitted the message that it was very important in the present circumstances for central banks to do what they have to do. You know that we have been exemplary in terms of providing liquidity to the euro area as a whole, in terms of taking appropriate decisions at the very beginning. You remember that it was on 9 August 2007 that we decided to take important decisions, at a time when some observers were not sure that the situation was that acute. After a very short span of time, everybody recognised that we were lucid and right in acting without waiting. And we proved that recently: as you know, we have agreed with the Federal Reserve on a swap of 240 billion dollars that permits us to ensure liquidity also in dollars, not only in euro, on this side of the Atlantic. We are ourselves doing what we have to do. And in a period when it appears that the situation calls for government responsibility, I confirm that we judge it appropriate that governments take up their responsibilities. I think they did well in the case you mentioned, they did well in other cases, including in this country: I confirm that I think the government did well in Germany. We will continue to live up to our own responsibility. The times are demanding, as I said, the situation is demanding and uncertain, and of course in such circumstances it is important that all of the private sector as well as the public sector, that all authorities live up to their responsibilities.. Secondly, in September 2001 you cut interest rates by 50 basis points unexpectedly and also in conjunction with the US Federal Reserve. Is that a possibility, that we might see something comparable in the weeks and months ahead? My third question: could you tell us what you think would be a reasonable outcome from this meeting you are attending in Paris on Saturday with the EU leaders? As regards your first question, I commented that I would attribute predictability to the wisdom and lucidity of observers, but I never comment on immediate reactions that the introductory statement could trigger in the market. I consider it would be absolutely inappropriate to comment in real time, it would be a dialogue with a mirror. So I trust the lucidity of observers, but I don’t comment on their immediate reaction. As regards your second question on the possibility of having close cooperation with the other central banks, be aware of the fact that when we do something, it is on the basis of our assessment of the balance of risks to price stability. We cannot do otherwise, because if we were acting in a different scheme, in a different concept, then we would suggest to those lucid observers and market participants that have been mentioned that they can unanchor our inflation expectations, because we would be introducing other considerations than this solid anchoring of inflation expectations which is based on our determination to deliver price stability in the medium term. And if we loosened this unachoring, it would be a very poor one, including in terms of financial stability. It would introduce volatility in all market interest rates: It would be very bad for financial stability, as well as for price stability. Let me also say that we have an extraordinary level of cooperation among the central banks. This is true of all the central banks. It is true of the Federal Reserve. It is unprecedented to have a swap agreement of 240 billion dollars. It is unprecedented to ensure, with several windows, dollar liquidity on this side of the Atlantic, in close cooperation with the Federal Reserve. We cooperate also with other central banks in particular with the Bank of England and other European banks as well as with the Bank of Japan. I think I have to stress the high level of mutual confidence that we have which permits this cooperation. Some decisions we have taken in a very short span of time across the Atlantic, despite the time lag. I think it’s heartening that we are in such intimate and confident cooperation. As regards your third question on the Paris meeting, I think that we will have the occasion to exchange views. I don’t want to prejudge – as you know, I never say in advance when I participate in any meeting what the meeting will produce. That is the case when I participate in a G7 meeting or in the G10 or the G20. We are having an exceptional meeting in the context of this exceptionally high level of uncertainty that we are presently experiencing. I expect that it will, overall, permit the authorities that will meet to exchange views in circumstances that are uncertain, to compare notes and to see how they could be enlightened by the conversation with others. Then I would say exactly the same as I say to the question on what we will decide at our next meeting: I would say there will be a press briefing by the Presidency of this meeting, after the Paris encounter and we will communicate what we have discussed there. My second question: you also talked about the possibility of growth recovering gradually in 2009. Is there a possibility that it might not recover and that Europe is going to experience a long recession? And one final question: would you, as the ECB, back the idea of a European-wide fund for Europe’s banks – a safety net as it would be – that has been floated this week? In response to your first question, I said that there were two options, but I also said that we were unanimous in making the decision that we made. I think it is very important to recall that we were unanimous in today’s decision. As regards your second question on the evolution of growth, I draw your attention to the fact that I have been saying for a very long time that growth would be very weak, i.e. there would be a trough in the second and third quarters, and that the risks to growth are on the downside. It is therefore clear today that some of the risks that were clearly highlighted in previous messages from the Governing Council in the previous months have materialised. From this point of view, our analysis has been consistent. We have never hidden the fact that there were downside risks to growth after the trough observed in the second and third quarters of this year. As regards your third question on the European fund, I have read about it a lot in the media, but as you see, I wait until after the meeting to make any declarations. I would confirm, however, that Europe is not a political federation. It does not have a federal budget and so the idea that we would be able to do the same as has been done on the other side of the Atlantic does not fit in with the political and institutional structure of Europe. That being said, in response to a question about a particular bank a moment ago, I also said that, in exceptional cases in which financial stability is at stake and we have done everything we can in terms of providing liquidity – and everybody can have confidence in the fact that we will do all that we can – it is important that governments also make the appropriate decisions. First of all, I would say that what we are observing in all markets, not particularly in the euro market, is that it is difficult to have a normally functioning market, with banks engaging in active borrowing and lending in the interbank market. This is not at all something that is specific to the euro area, we observe this everywhere. I have to say that it is something that we have observed to a much greater extent since the fall of Lehman Brothers, which has had enormous, very unfortunate consequences. That being said, we are doing what we judge to be appropriate in order to cope with this situation and I will not comment on any modification of the deposit rate. We confirm the present level of the deposit rate. We have since the very beginning indicated that we were making a strict separation between the monetary policy stance and the implementation of monetary policy, namely the refinancing that were engaging in with the commercial banks. We are on this line, and I have already explained why it is a line which is very important: not only because it is necessary for our mandate and for us to provide what the people of Europe are asking for, but also for financial stability. And I confirm that we will continue to go along this line. Our decisions on the monetary policy stance are based upon our assessment of the balance of risks to price stability. And I said that we were today seeing that there was some reduction in the upside risks to price stability but that we still had upside risks to price stability. And of course we will continue to do what is necessary. I tell households, our fellow citizens in Europe, that they can trust us to deliver price stability. They can count on us, and we are fully conscious of the fact that it is their main concern today. I am speaking there of our fellow citizens, not of economic agents. But for economic agents and market participants, it is also extremely important that we continue to be the solid anchor of expectations, because we then diminish the volatility of the financial markets. That being said, we have proved that we were agile in refinancing the market and we will continue to be agile. The banks can count on us. I call on all to be up to their responsibilities. It is true that we do not have a real market. We are in a situation where, collectively, the banks have a tendency, probably, to over-assess the risks that they are taking in engaging in loans with other commercial banks. Market participants were underpricing risks before the financial turmoil, and we said that publicly. In some cases it is absolutely clear that we now have the reverse phenomenon. The pendulum has gone too far, and a large number of market participants are behaving in a way that means they are not optimising their behaviour at all. They are going too far in the other direction. I call upon them to keep their composure. And with these very, very high liquidity injections, you give the idea that no solvent bank will go away without money. Do governments need to give the message that no bank will fail in Europe like Lehman in the US? First of all I would say that all authorities, all entities, whether public or private, have to be up to their responsibilities, particularly in this period, which is demanding, as I already said. And all governments – but not only governments – have to be up to their responsibilities. Of course we are not the United States of America as far as the institutional framework is concerned. In responding to your first question, I was also responding to your second question. All governments have to be up to their responsibilities. I will only say that what we have observed since the turbulence began in August last year has been a remarkable resilience of the emerging economies. This has been the case everywhere, in Asia, Latin America and central and Eastern Europe. It was something worth noting because it was the first time that we had seen more resilience in the developing world and the emerging world than in the industrialised world. So it was a premiere in terms of the evolution of the global economy. That being said, it is no time for complacency: certainly not in the industrialised world, as we can clearly see, but also not in the emerging world either. We will examine that very carefully, of course, with the Polish central bank and the Polish government. I think it is certainly a very important political move and a strategic statement of primary importance, taking into account the importance of Poland in Europe and also taking into account the previous signs coming from Warsaw. So I take it that it is a very important statement and that we now have to discuss and see exactly what would be the appropriate conclusion to be drawn from, again, what I take to be a strategic statement. The dates themselves have to be examined but what counts is the strategic statement that has been made. I would say that they made, in exceptional circumstances, a very hard decision. But I could go on and on and give praise to all governments in Europe! By way of conclusion, let me only say, again, that our fellow citizens in Europe can count on us. We will deliver price stability. We have proven that we have been able to take the appropriate decision whenever necessary and to be credible in saying that. I would also say that we are living in a situation which is exceptional, where there is a very high level of uncertainty. We will continue to examine the situation carefully. At the present moment, we have seen the upside risks to price stability somewhat diminishing but not eliminated. They have diminished, but are still there. "
2008-09-04,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, at today’s meeting we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since the last meeting has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time and that upside risks to price stability over the medium term prevail. While the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The latest economic data also confirm the weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008. This reflects partly an expected technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first quarter as well as dampening effects from global and domestic factors, including direct and indirect effects from high commodity prices. In this environment, it remains imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. In full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that we are resolute in our determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. This will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and support sustainable growth and employment. On the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, following strong quarterly growth of 0.7% in the first quarter, euro area real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2008. In terms of quarter-on-quarter growth, private consumption declined by 0.2% and there was a perceptible weakness in investment, which fell by 1.2%. Growth in both euro area imports and exports declined by 0.4%. Taking into account all available information, the euro area economy is currently experiencing an episode of weak activity characterised by high commodity prices weighing on consumer confidence and demand, as well as by dampened investment growth. We expect this episode to be followed by a gradual recovery. In particular, if persistent, the fall in oil prices from their peak in July will help strengthen real disposable income, with the level of employment remaining high and the unemployment rate low by historical standards. Moreover, growth in the world economy is expected to remain relatively resilient, benefiting mainly from sustained growth in emerging economies. This should support external demand for euro area goods and services and thereby investment. This outlook is also reflected in the September 2008 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. The exercise projects average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.1% and 1.7% in 2008, and between 0.6% and 1.8% in 2009. In comparison with the June Eurosystem staff projections, real GDP growth figures for 2008 and 2009 are lower. In the view of the Governing Council, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity is particularly high at the current juncture and, generally, downside risks prevail. Risks stem particularly from renewed increases in energy and food prices, which could dampen consumption and investment. Moreover, downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than currently foreseen. The possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also implies downside risks to the outlook for economic activity, as do concerns about rising protectionist pressures. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, standing at 3.8% in August according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, after 4.0% in June and July 2008. This worrying level of inflation is largely the result of both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level. Moreover, wage growth has been picking up in recent quarters, at a time when labour productivity growth has decelerated, resulting in sharp increases in unit labour costs. Looking ahead, on the basis of current commodity futures prices, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for quite some time, moderating only gradually during the course of 2009. Consistent with this view, the September ECB staff projections foresee average annual HICP inflation at between 3.4% and 3.6% in 2008, and between 2.3% and 2.9% in 2009. The higher inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 mainly reflect higher energy prices and, to a lesser extent, higher food and services prices than assumed previously. In this context, it is important to recall the conditional nature of the ECB staff projections. They are based on a number of assumptions that are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. In particular, the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates reflect market expectations as at mid-August. Moreover, it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumption that oil and non-oil commodity prices, while remaining at elevated levels, will exhibit greater stability over the projection horizon than has been the case in recent months, in line with prevailing futures prices. It is the Governing Council’s view that, at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, there are upside risks to the outlook for price developments. These risks include the possibility of renewed increases in commodity prices and of previous rises having further and stronger indirect effects on consumer prices. There is particularly a very strong concern that the emergence of broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour could add significantly to inflationary pressures. Moreover, the upside risks to price stability could be aggravated by unexpected rises in indirect taxes and administered prices. Against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. Broad-based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage‑setting behaviour must be avoided. The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. All parties concerned – in both the private and the public sectors – must meet their responsibilities in this regard. The Governing Council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council calls for these schemes to be abolished. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. In line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. Over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. Not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets, the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons. While the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, reflecting the policy measures taken since 2005 to address risks to price stability, the strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The currently flat yield curve has given rise to a substitution from longer maturity assets into monetary instruments, which offer similar remuneration but greater liquidity and less risk. This substitution has led the current headline rate of M3 growth to overstate the underlying pace of monetary expansion. At the same time, shifts out of overnight deposits drove the annual growth rate of M1 down further in July. These effects, as well as other temporary factors, must be taken into account when assessing monetary developments and their implications. A broad-based analysis of the data, taking the appropriate medium-term perspective and allowing for these considerations, confirms the underlying strength of money growth. In particular, the pace, maturity and sectoral composition of borrowing from banks suggest that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions. This notwithstanding, growth in loans now shows signs of moderation, as previously anticipated, with corporate demand for credit slowing. At the same time, the growth of loans to households continues to follow the downward trend observed over the past few years, as a result of higher short-term interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The information that has become available since the last meeting of the Governing Council has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time. The growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, but the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued risks to price stability over the medium term. The latest economic data also confirm the weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008. This reflects partly an expected technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first quarter as well as dampening effects from global and domestic factors, including direct and indirect effects from high commodity prices. Against this background, it remains imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. In full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that we are resolute in our determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. On the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, budget plans for 2009 should fully reflect existing policy commitments. This implies that euro area countries with relatively large fiscal deficits need to specify much more ambitious and concrete consolidation measures, especially on the expenditure side. Countries that have already achieved their medium-term budgetary objectives need to ensure that they maintain sound structural fiscal positions. At the current juncture, the steady pursuit of stability-oriented fiscal policies would help to contain inflationary pressures and provide the required budgetary room for manoeuvre to allow automatic stabilisers to contribute to smoothing the business cycle. Turning to structural policies, measures that reduce adjustment costs and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance in the current economic circumstances. While this is crucial in all euro area countries, it is particularly pressing in those that have experienced a significant loss of cost and price competitiveness over recent years and where unemployment has already started to rise. Moreover, fostering productivity through enhanced investment in innovation and education enlarges the scope for increases in real incomes in the longer run. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * Second, I would like to ask you the standard question at this stage: do you have a bias? And, if you do, what is it? And, also, did you debate and come to a conclusion on the changes to the ECB’s collateral framework? As regards your first question, at the end of this press conference you will receive the usual press release on the staff projections. Let me only restate that these are the staff projections. They are an important input for the Governing Council. But as you know we do not underwrite the staff projections ourselves. To respond very clearly to your question on GDP for 2008 – the new staff projections are from 1.1% to 1.7%; and for 2009 they are from 0.6% to 1.8%. On the second question, which was, as you said, the “standard question”, it is important to note that we consider that the present monetary policy stance will contribute to achieve our goal, which is the delivery of price stability over the medium term. We concentrated in our discussion at today’s meeting on one option, which was maintaining rates at their present level. We were unanimous in making that decision and, I would say, we are in exactly the same mood as at the last meeting of the Governing Council, as indicated during the last press conference when I expressed our position. We have exactly the same position. We have no bias. That being said, we are never pre-committed and we always do what is necessary to deliver price stability in the medium term and to be credible in that delivery. Being credible in that delivery permits the anchoring of inflationary expectations, and I emphasised the importance of that point. On the ECB’s collateral framework, perhaps I could reserve your question until later because we have a decision to announce today, which I will do at the end of the press conference. As regards the judgment of the Governing Council, I will sum it up in saying that the risks to price stability that we see are exactly what we saw at the last meeting and they are on the upside. We have upside risks to price stability – we are clear on that. As you will recall, we have only one needle in our compass, which is the delivery of price stability. If I had a message that were a little bit different from the last meeting, I would say that the Governing Council particularly insists on the necessity to avoid second-round effects, both on the side of the price-setter in general and on the side of the social partners. In this domain, we are calling on all parties very strongly to avoid those effects. We are making that point not only because it would create a big problem for delivering price stability and hamper in the medium and long term the purchasing power of our fellow citizens, but it will also play against employment. And that is something the Governing Council wants to particularly stress. My second question is whether you, like your colleague, Mr Stark, see broad-based, second-round effects in the euro area? And, finally, do you think that market expectations for no change to rates this year are appropriate? The projections, as I said, are the staff projections, we do not underwrite these projections. They are an important input, but we also look at the other analyses that are made by the public and private sector. You have the figures in front of you; so you can see the figures produced by staff with regard to average growth. Neither the average growth figures for this year, nor those for next year, are negative. As regards the profile of growth, the Governing Council is observing what is going on, and it is very much in line with what we said before. We said a month ago that we would see a trough in the profile of growth in the second and third quarter. And this is what we are observing. The sentiment of the Governing Council is that, after this trough, we will have a gradual recovery. As regards broad-based, second-round effects in the euro, we are clearly signalling that our main message is precisely to avoid broad-based, second-round effects. We have seen some second-round effects, but not broad-based ones. Our message is absolutely clear: broad-based, second-round effects have to be avoided, because they would lead to all of the consequences I have already mentioned. In other words, they would not permit us to achieve price stability or to consolidate the success of the euro area in terms of job creation and current levels of employment. So, we are in a mode of preventing broad-based, second-round effects. We have observed some second-round effects, particularly in those economies that have in-built indexation mechanisms. These are particularly adverse in the present circumstances, because the second-round effects are being introduced precisely by way of such mechanisms. As regards your third question whether market expectations for no change to rates this year are appropriate, to the market, I repeat: we have no bias. Equally, we never pre-commit and we always do what is necessary to deliver price stability. Secondly, you have said you have no bias. Why not? You have got inflation at above your definition of price stability for the next two years and you have said that risks are to the upside. And finally, one of your colleagues recently described interest rates at the moment as accommodative. Would you repeat that? First of all, with regard to my colleague’s declaration, as you know, I am the only one who speaks on behalf of the Governing Council. So I draw your attention to that slight difference. Many colleagues might make remarks that are very useful, very interesting and stimulating, and also very adapted to the environment in which they find themselves. Indeed, I think it is important that what we communicate is adapted as much as possible to various circumstances. However, as regards the position of the Governing Council, I suggest that you follow what I say on behalf of the Governing Council, of course. As regards your question why we do not have any bias, we have just increased interest rates and we increased them precisely to be sure that, taking into account the risks that we see, we can cope with those risks, offsetting them as much as possible. Again, the position of the Governing Council is that the present monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective and delivering price stability in the medium-term. With regard to the precise moment of delivery of price stability in line with our definition, we consider that we will deliver price stability in the course of 2010. I do not want to be more precise but I say clearly that this is when we will deliver price stability. And the second question is: apparently the oil price has a strong impact on your projections, or the projections of the staff. Can you tell us something about the weight of the oil price in these calculations? On growth potential, it is a pertinent remark of economists that when you have a big change in relative prices, as it is the case, there are a number of phenomena that appear, including the fact that part of the stock of capital becomes, for various reasons, partly obsolescent, and then you undoubtedly have a shock to growth potential. I mention that because I think it has to be in our minds. I cannot give you at this stage a position of the Governing Council as regards the degree to which we would consider that - at the moment at which we are speaking - growth potential has diminished. It’s not a phenomenon which would hit particularly the euro area. It’s a phenomenon which would hit all economies, because it would be a shock of the same nature for all economies. So it should not be considered negligible. It is something which must be significant, but we have no position of the Governing Council on a new revised level of growth potential. As regards oil prices, we are in a situation which is really a universe of great volatility, as one sees. All forecasters, all economists that are embarking on the difficult exercise of projections have exactly the same problem, whether they are from public or private institutions, and it’s clear that the price of oil and commodities has a big impact. It’s also clear that all institutions have their own methodology. But the methodology that I have found to be the most common is not perfect, obviously, because it consists in having a snapshot of prices at a certain moment, with a certain deadline, generally in having some kind of average of the days preceding a deadline. It is what our staff does. And then you take the futures. But the futures market is going up and down as does the spot market, with a slope which is changing from time to time. So, again, it’s true for the staff projections of the ECB as well as for all projections: they are highly conditional. And my second question is: you picked up on the sharp decline in M1 money growth. Do you draw any particular message from that? On the exchange rate I will repeat what you know to be my position. I have noted with extreme attention that the US authorities have said that a strong dollar was in the interests of the United States of America, and I see that this declaration is believed by a number of operators and market participants. And I will again echo what is said by the US authorities themselves, which I have always considered to be very important, even at a time when perhaps market participants were less attentive to what was said. As regards M1, M2 and M3, I said on behalf of the Governing Council that we see in the growth differential between the various monetary aggregates the influence of the very particular yield curve that we have today. And the dynamism of M3 is partly due to the fact that this yield curve is flat and that a large proportion of investors are not taking the risk to be longer. It’s also clear that, as regards M1, the present constellation of rates calls for M1 to be very moderate in its behaviour. Since we are addressing the issue of the monetary aggregates, on the counterparts of the monetary aggregates I will only mention that the figures we still have for yearly growth of the outstanding loans to non-financial corporations are at the level of 13.2%, last month it was 13.6%. So we see the tendency to diminish, but it remains very robust: a multiple of the growth of GDP in value terms. And this is one of the reasons why I said that we don’t see as yet a significant correction of these dynamics that could be interpreted as associated with the financial turmoil. My second question refers to inflation: we have heard from one of your colleagues that the Governing Council is not sure that the price stability goal of 2% will be met on average in 2010, and you have just said that you are looking at delivering price stability during the course of 2010. Am I therefore right in understanding that you are suggesting that average annual inflation in 2010 will be above 2%? I will only say that we will be back to our definition of price stability during the course of 2010. I am not going to qualify the average. Again, I will say very clearly that we take decisions as and when they are needed in order to deliver price stability in the medium term. We increased rates very recently, precisely in order to reach that goal. We will do what is necessary to reach the goal of achieving price stability in the medium term, and I think we have proved we are credible when we say this. Concerning the consequences that we expect for growth and inflation as a result of the deceleration of the euro I already said everything that I have to say on growth and inflation themselves. It is of course important to synthesise the numerous factors that are influencing both growth and inflation. And I have already given you our position regarding these factors. My second question – a slightly shorter-term issue – oil prices have been falling quite sharply recently, how quickly do you think that could have an effect on quarterly growth rates in the euro area? As regards the fall in potential growth, it clearly means that whatever rate of growth you observe at a certain moment, all other things equal, the so-called output gap would be weaker in the case of decreased potential growth than it would have been had potential growth not decreased. It therefore clearly has an impact on the assessment of the absence of inflationary pressures that is associated with a weak episode in growth. For this reason, we think it is important to have that in mind, even if I was very cautious and prudent, as you can see in terms of the assessment of the quantity of the figures. As regards your second question, we are very cautious and prudent in this respect. The kind of volatility that we are seeing on the oil and commodity markets is exceptional. It is a very complex combination of underlying drivers. Demand has very much been driving prices over the past few years. But we should not neglect the fact that there are also all the elements that could characterise a cartel. The question of supply is therefore an open question which is also extremely important and might have been more important in the recent period, marked by the spike in oil prices. There is also the financial market element that has played a role: a lot of investors have decided to diversify their portfolios and have started to purchase instruments representing commodities, including oil, in the futures market. This might be one of the additional reasons why we are observing such hectic behaviour on commodities markets. At this stage, I would say again that all projections are based on a certain methodology. I accept that this methodology is theoretical, and, in a universe that is extraordinarily uncertain, we have to recognise the fact that it is highly theoretical, but we do not have any other means to be objective in trying to take into account the future. Therefore, I would only say at this stage that, even with the recent slowdown in the price of oil, there is still the possibility of new spikes, which I hope will not be observed as it would be very bad for the global economy, for inflation and for all parties concerned. I therefore urge all partners, irrespective of whether they are involved in the demand side or in the supply side, to be responsible. I am speaking not only for oil producers that are emerging countries, but also for all producers that are in the industrialised world. I also said this two months and three months ago. I therefore urge them to be as responsible as possible because there is a common interest in the global economy. I also think that those who have invested massively in those instruments representing commodities need to ensure that they are not embarking into any kind of bubble. So again, I have this message, but I am not going to embark on a sensitivity analysis of whether the price of oil will go up or down. It is one of the elements we look at very carefully. We also look, at the break-even on a five-year basis, the break-even on a ten-year basis, but, the five-year forward break-even in five years is certainly one of the important indicators. It is complex because it incorporates risk premia on top of inflation expectations, and you know that analysts are working a lot to try to disentangle the information on risk premia and on inflation expectations which are contained in this break-even concept. We also have other ways of looking at inflation expectations, including the surveys. However, the reason why I emphasised the fact that a solid anchoring of inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability is for us absolutely key is that we see, under the global circumstances that we have to cope with, a tendency for these measures of inflation expectations to creep up. This is true for the surveys and forecasts as well as for the break-even that we extract from financial markets. There is also something which we look at very carefully, which is that after the recent decrease of the price of oil we saw a very significant decrease of the break-even that we extract from the five-year bond, and a very significant decrease of the break-even that we extract from the ten-year bond. So both five-years and ten-years were decreasing, but the five-year forward break-even itself was quite steady at a level which we do not consider satisfactory. We are all working very much on the transmission channel. As you know, there are many transmission channels, including the credibility channel. And the anchoring of inflation expectations that we just mentioned is absolutely decisive in this respect. So there are differences on both sides of the Atlantic. I would say at this stage that what we have observed in the banking sector until now – and I am prudent and cautious – does not signal that we have a banking sector which is, at this moment in time, hampered by its level of capitalisation. So we might not observe on this side of the Atlantic the same kind of developments that are observed on the other side. My second question to you has to do with the fact that we will all have the chance to talk about the idea of a recession in the euro zone, depending on what the third quarter GDP numbers do. Of course, that is an important concept from across the Atlantic, and it has never been as straightforward as simply two quarters of contracting GDP. So I wondered if you could elaborate on whether you think this is a sensible guide for the euro zone – I know it has not been always used that way – and whether it feels like there might be a recession in the euro zone as a whole. As regards the assumption that market participants or traders or investors can make, I leave to them the responsibility of their assumption. As far as we are concerned, as you know we are never pre-committed. We do what we believe is necessary at any time, and we have proved that in the past, including in the very recent past. Again, we will do what is necessary in an environment which is changing. We see as regards the inflationary risks that they are on the upside. We also believe that the decision we took two months ago and therefore the present monetary policy stance will contribute to delivering price stability in the medium term. As regards the profile of growth, I have said already – and there is full confirmation of this, and again, it is nothing new – that the second and third quarters are a trough in the profile. I will not embark on any qualification of the technical definitions of the situation. I have no particular comment on that, but we are in a trough, that is absolutely clear, and progressively we will see a gradual recovery. As regards Europe, and we are speaking for Europe, four months ago we pre-announced that we were, after a brilliant first quarter, experiencing a trough. We said this because it was clearly our sentiment as regards the profile of growth. So again we are not surprised. There is no judgement on what is being done on the other side of the Atlantic. They have their own decision-making process. I don’t make any judgment on their fiscal policy and as you know certainly not on their monetary policy. However, I would mention one thing: there is a difference between the two sides of the Atlantic: We are balanced in particular as regards the crucial relationship between savings and investment, domestic savings and domestic investment. On the other side of the Atlantic, even though some progress has been made, there are still significant imbalances. No, I said “one”. We concentrated on one. Let me now tell you what the Governing Council has decided today as regards the control measures in the Eurosystem credit operations. As you know, we have a way of reviewing our framework every two years, and the previous reviews were reflected in the risk control framework and the General Documentation that we published in 2004 and 2006. So the present set of decisions, they are the following: As regards ABSs, we have decided to apply to asset-backed securities a uniform haircut of 12% for all residual maturities and all coupon types. So 12% across the board. I have to mention that we are not, then, increasing haircuts for all ABSs, because we had already applied a 12% haircut to some ABSs – ABSs with a fixed coupon and a residual maturity of more than ten years. And for ABSs with a zero coupon and such residual maturity – the haircut so far has been 18%. But it is true that for ABS with lower residual maturity, the Eurosystem is now increasing haircuts. Still on the ABSs, we have decided to apply a haircut add-on to ABSs that are theoretically valued, in the form of a valuation markdown of 5%. The valuation markdown is applied to the theoretical price before the application of the 12% haircut. The total discount on the price is then exactly 16.4%, when you compute first the 5% and then the 12%. On bank bonds, we have decided to apply a haircut add-on of 5% to unsecured bank bonds. As regards close links in ABS transactions, we have decided to prohibit the submission as collateral of any ABS by a counterparty when this counterparty - or any third party that has close links to it - provides support to that ABS by entering into a currency hedge with the issuer or guarantor of the ABS or by providing liquidity support of more than 20% of the asset-backed security’s nominal value. We have also introduced a new decision on the ratings, and we want higher rating disclosure standards. With regard to the External Credit Assessment Institutions, the so-called ECAI sources, the credit assessment must be based on a public rating. For ABSs, ratings must be explained in a publicly available credit rating report, being a detailed presale or new issue report, including inter alia a comprehensive analysis of structural and legal aspects and a detailed collateral pool assessment. So this involves the External Credit Assessment Institutions. Moreover, we would ask the External Credit Assessment Institutions to publish rating reviews for ABSs at least on a quarterly basis. So these are the precise decisions that we have taken. I will only mention that we will make more explicit in the General Documentation the discretion of the Eurosystem in excluding or limiting the use of certain assets, also at the level of individual counterparties. This is in line with Article 18.1 of the ESCB Statute. But we will certainly stress that. What I can say on these measures is that they were designed to refine particular elements of our risk control framework. We wanted to ensure that the Eurosystem remains adequately protected against the observed changes in financial markets. These measures, as you see, do not change the general characteristics of the Eurosystem’s collateral framework, and, in particular, there is no change in the eligibility status of any asset type currently accepted in Eurosystem credit operations. And I have to say that – and this is the reason why we are not changing the structure of our framework – we consider that it has served us very well, particularly since the beginning of the financial turbulence. I have said to you before that we had not to change our collateral framework. And we are not changing it. We are refining it, whereas in some other cases some bolder reforms had to be embarked on. We are applying our own rules of reviewing our framework every two years, refining it when and where needed. All those measures will be implemented only as of 1 February 2009, and so we trust that we have given an adequate time frame for all our counterparties to prepare for these refined rules. As a result of the new haircuts for unsecured bank bonds and ABSs, we expect that some counterparties will need to bring forward collateral in addition to the amount currently deposited with the Eurosystem in order to maintain their current levels of over-collateralisation. However, we consider that the overall impact on the availability of collateral will not impair the ability of banks to participate in the Eurosystem credit operations. So we see that this refinement will, again, not impair the ability of the banks to participate in our operations. This was what I wanted to tell you as regards the biennial review of he risk control measures. I will also tell you that we took other decisions during this Governing Council meeting. We have decided today to renew the outstanding six-month SLTRO expiring in October 2008, at an unchanged amount of €25 billion and with maturity date on 9 April next year. We have also decided to renew the two three-month outstanding SLTROs expiring in November and December 2008 at unchanged amounts of €50 billion and with maturity dates on 12 February and 12 March 2009 respectively. On that too you will have a press release immediately. So you will have a press release on the staff projections, a press release on our decisions on the collateral framework and a press release on this renewal of operations, three months and six months. Second, just on the motivation, is it just about insuring the risk profile of your operations, or is it also about getting markets working again? First of all, as I said, we don’t think that it would hamper the way the system is functioning and impair the capacity of the banks to participate in our operations. I prefer not to give you any figures, but it is, as indicated, a small fraction of the present total amount of collateral. Again, I prefer to utilise the term “refining”; we are refining our collateral framework. We did that with a view to optimising our risk control. The motivation can be, as a by-product, that we will have a positive impact that will help the market to be more active. But I would say that we have been reasoning very much on the basis of our risk control and with a view to optimising our own risk control. But I don’t exclude of course the by-product that I just mentioned. I don’t have the figure here. I prefer not to give you a figure which would be challenged, but this can be checked very easily….. No, we have no target to bring it down at this stage. As I said, we maintain the eligibility of the various categories of collateral. We only want to be sure that we are optimising the risk management of this collateral. No, what I said was that we wanted that it would be absolutely clear that we would have a comprehensive analysis of the structural and the legal aspects of the ABS in question, of the assets that are backing that security, a detailed assessment of the collateral pool, and that we wanted this assessment to be repeated on a quarterly basis. I have nothing else to say at this stage. My second question: we all know more or less that there has been some anecdotal evidence that apparently there has been a change in the use of collateral, in part in some countries with problems in the mortgage markets, which apply to the ABSs of course. But what is new to me is that there have been problems with unsecured bank bonds, which I think is a tradition of Germany but I’m not sure. What is the deeper reason for this, for the change in the haircut on the bank bonds? First of all, as regards the 18% so far has been applied to a certain category of ABS. The 12% is now the level of haircut that we apply across the board, as I already said. The 5% valuation markdown is on top of that for those particular ABSs that are theoretically valued, which is cumulative with the 12% or any other haircut. As regards the bank bonds, we judged that it was appropriate to introduce this haircut of 5% on unsecured bank bonds. I have no other explanation. It’s true that we have observed an increase in the use of unsecured bank bonds, and we consider that they remain eligible, but we have introduced this element of haircut. First of all, we were not an institution that considered that what we had been observing since 9 August 2007 was a very temporary short-term episode. We took it seriously from the very first day, as you know, and our judgement appeared to be right in this respect, i.e. that it was a very serious and very significant market correction that could last. It has lasted, you are absolutely right. Again, I’m happy that our collateral framework appeared to be adapted to new circumstances that were extraordinarily demanding for all of us, and this was absolutely clear across the Atlantic, across the Channel. We see tensions continuing, that’s clear enough. Particularly when you look at the differential between the three-month deposits and the overnight swap interest rates, you clearly see that we still have an anomaly at least in comparison with what was the case in major markets before the start of the turbulence. So we have all the elements to characterise something which is very lasting. That being said, we also have to work for, in particular as regards the functioning of markets, a more normal functioning of markets. It is the efforts that are being made by colleagues everywhere in the world, particularly in the industrialised world. We are cooperating very closely as you know. I didn’t announce anything on our cooperation across the Atlantic with the Fed, but you know that we have a very close cooperation with the Federal Reserve as regards precisely this refinancing in dollars. And I would say that we will continue in the central bank constituency to be very close to the market, monitoring the market and trying to help in any respect, because the ultimate goal is to return to a more normal functioning. But again, at this stage we have to take into account the fact that we still have to be very alert. It is no time for complacency in any respect, as you know. No, I would say that we have a biennial review and that we have considered since the very beginning of the turbulence that we have no reason to change our framework, so we did not. Had we reasoned as you suggest, then we would have immediately said we are in a period of turbulence, all risks are augmenting, we have to change immediately. It’s not at all what we did. So we continued to operate as we had in the past. We have a review. We considered that we were in our sentiment in the Governing Council not exactly at the optimum with the system which was set up two years ago, long before the start of the turbulence. And that’s the reason why we have taken the decisions I just mentioned and that you will have in more detail in the press communiqué immediately after the press conference. "
2008-08-07,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in July. It has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time and that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. This assessment is underpinned by continued vigorous money growth, with so far no signs of significant constraints on bank loan supply. In such a context, it remains crucial to avoid broadly based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. The latest economic data point to a weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008, which in part was expected after the exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter. Against this background and in full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. This will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and support sustainable growth and employment. On the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The information on economic activity that has become available since the July press conference suggests that real GDP growth figures for mid-2008 will be substantially weaker than for the first quarter of the year. As indicated on previous occasions, this represents partly a technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first months of the year. In addition, it also partly reflects a weakening in GDP growth due to factors such as slower expansion at the global level and dampening effects from high and volatile oil and food prices. In order to assess the underlying momentum of euro area economic activity and to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly outturns, it is necessary to look through the volatility in quarter-on-quarter growth rates and monthly indicators. Taking this perspective, growth in the world economy, while moderating, is expected to remain relatively resilient, benefiting in particular from sustained growth in emerging economies. This should support external demand for euro area goods and services. As regards domestic developments, in a medium-term perspective the fundamentals of the euro area are sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. Investment growth in the euro area has provided ongoing, though moderating, support to economic activity. Moreover, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly, and unemployment rates remain low in historical terms. However, these developments, which support household disposable income and consumption, are unlikely to fully compensate the loss of purchasing power caused by higher energy and food prices. In the view of the Governing Council, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity remains high, owing to, among other things, the very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets. Overall, downside risks prevail. In particular, risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. Moreover, downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than currently anticipated. The possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also implies downside risks to the outlook for economic activity, as do concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures. In this respect, the failure of the recent negotiations in the context of the World Trade Organization’s Doha round on trade liberalisation is a major setback. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, reaching 4.0% in June 2008 and, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, 4.1% in July. This worrying level of inflation rates results largely from both direct and indirect effects of past sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level. At the same time, while labour productivity growth has decelerated, there are some indications that labour cost growth has been rising in recent quarters. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for commodities, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain well above a level consistent with price stability for quite some time, moderating only gradually in 2009. Risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon remain clearly on the upside and have increased over the past few months. These risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices and of increasing indirect effects on consumer prices. There is a very strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures via broadly based second-round effects. The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. Furthermore, there are potential upside risks from unanticipated rises in indirect taxes and administered prices. Against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. The shift in relative prices and the related transfer of income from commodity-importing countries to commodity-exporting countries require a change in the behaviour of companies and households. Therefore, broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. All parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, must meet their responsibilities in this regard. In this context, the Governing Council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. In line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. Over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. Not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets, the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons. While the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, also reflecting the policy measures taken since 2005 to address upside risks to price stability, the strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued risks to price stability over the medium term. The current yield curve has led to very rapid increases in time deposits and to a substantial decline in annual M1 growth. Such effects and other temporary factors must be taken into account in assessing monetary developments. Overall, a broad-based analysis of the data, taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, confirms the underlying strength of money growth. One of the main factors leading to this conclusion is the still high growth of MFI loans to the private sector, which is underpinning the robust nature of monetary growth. The pace, maturity and sectoral composition of bank borrowing suggest that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions. Higher short-term interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area have dampened the growth of household borrowing over the past few years. By contrast, and notwithstanding tighter financing conditions and moderating economic growth, the expansion of bank credit to non-financial corporations thus far remains very robust. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability, and monetary aggregates continue to grow vigorously, with so far no signs of significant constraints on bank loan supply. The latest economic data point to a weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008, which in part was expected after the exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter. Against this background, it remains crucial to avoid broadly based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. In full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. On the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, there are risks that some countries will not achieve their fiscal targets this year. In this situation a rigorous implementation of budget plans and the avoidance of expenditure slippage are of crucial importance. Budget plans for 2009, which are currently being finalised in a number of countries, need to reflect European commitments. In particular, countries with still large deficits must provide ambitious and concrete deficit reduction plans, backed by clearly specified measures, preferably on the expenditure side. Where budgetary scope is available, automatic stabilisers can contribute to the smoothing of cyclical economic fluctuations. As regards structural policies, measures which reduce adjustment costs and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance, particularly in the current climate of high inflation and slowing real GDP growth. These include the removal of impediments to competition in the services sector in general, and at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors, as well as in the energy sector, more specifically. Equally, making labour markets more flexible and enhancing investment in education and training would foster productivity, thereby increasing the scope for increases in real incomes. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * And also, you said last month you have no bias in terms of your monetary policy stance. Is that still the case? And also, in light of upcoming wage negotiations in some large euro area countries, were some members of the Governing Council of the opinion that you should be in a stance of heightened alertness, or strong vigilance? On the first question, you remember that last time, a month ago I said that we would have, at mid-year, a trough, in our own understanding, and that we should, in any case, add up the first quarter and the second quarter to take into account the fact that the first quarter was, in certain economies in particular and in the euro area as a whole, exceptionally robust. And I will certainly confirm that. We will see what our new forecasts, our new staff projections, are when we meet in September. Then I will display the new staff projections and I will be more in a position to comment on your question. At the present moment I would say that what we have seen is that as regards the risks that we have listed as the downside risks for growth in the euro area – I did that last time on behalf of the Governing Council, and also in the month before – there is some materialisation of these risks that were identified. But they were already identified: thus for us, it is not a surprise. We knew that there were risks, and those risks are materialising. I have already, last month, identified clearly the second and third quarter of this year as being particularly weak. Later on we will see, and it will be much better to discuss that during our next rendezvous in September with the new staff projections. As regards your second question, what is important in what I have said is that, on the basis of our current assessment, the current monetary policy stance contributes to achieving our objective. And, I would say as candidly as possible, we have no bias. And, as you know, we are never pre-committed and we always do what we judge, at any time, appropriate to deliver price stability and be credible in the delivery of price stability. On your third question, which was on the wage and salary negotiations in particular, again, you might have noted that when we are speaking, on behalf of the Governing Council, of wages and salary increases, we also mention the price-setting issue. And we are not making any difference between this particular price, which is wages and salaries, and the other prices, where we might judge that there is not sufficient competition between the firms and where some price-setting is abnormal. As regards wages and salaries, we have had a very clear message for a number of months or quarters, and I will repeat now very solemnly that we consider it absolutely essential that we have no second-round effects in this domain. It’s essential not only for price stability; it’s essential for medium-term sustainable growth and job creation and for preserving the substantial progress which has been made in this domain over the last years. And I did not hear any comment on the oil prices, which decreased considerably in the last weeks. Do you think it will have an impact on inflation and will slow down inflation faster than you thought? Let me take your second question first. I have mentioned on a number of occasions, on behalf of the Governing Council, that the price of oil – and not only of oil, also of food – was high and volatile. I would say that “volatile” captures pretty well the evolution that we have seen in the most recent period. We have had a peak, and then it went down. We will see what happens. We are entirely pragmatic, and predictions of the future prices of commodities are probably the most difficult exercise you can imagine. Personally, I consider that the peak in the price of oil and commodities was abnormal and did not correspond to what would be an equilibrium price. But we will see what happens. We have to be, again, totally humble in the presence of facts and figures, and we will see what happens. I think “high and volatile” is a good description, a good way to capture things in the present situation. As regards your first question on growth, again, what we are seeing is that you have the technical correction of the second quarter, after a first quarter which was extraordinarily robust, particularly in some countries, in Germany in particular. So since the very beginning it has been perfectly known that we would have a correction, a technical correction. And that is the reason why we always said that we had to take both the first and the second quarter together into account. Now, I have also mentioned other phenomena that are playing their role: in particular, but not exclusively, the slowing down at a global level, the dampening effect of the very high level of oil and commodities, which have added of course to the difficulty in this respect. But again, I give you a rendezvous for September as regards more precision in this domain with the new staff projections. The second question: Do you think that your actions in the money markets are enough to ease the tensions or do you think that you have to continue to do this and do everything … is there a point in the next few years when things will return to normal? And also, when you say that “again, there is no bias”, can we read into that that things go either way, that it is equally balanced on one side to the other? On the first question: as I have said we are totally pragmatic and humble in the face of facts and figures. We take them as they are. As regards the number of surveys that have come in and that we took note of, I would not say that we were surprised because we had already identified the risks and we had said clearly that the risks we had listed were on the downside. So, the fact that some of the survey data are very weak was for us the materialisation of risks that we had identified and made public. And again, we will see what happens, we will see what the second quarter and the third quarter bring. And, for what will come beyond the second and third quarters, I would refer you to the rendezvous I had already mentioned to your colleagues, to the meeting in September. But let me add something. Do not forget that – to again use a metaphor that is familiar – we have only one needle in our compass. That needle is price stability, our definition of price stability. We take all the information that comes in as contributions to indicate what the situation is with respect to that needle in our compass. We do not compare two needles, one of which being price stability and the other business activity or cyclical development , or whatever. That is not the way we operate. Everybody knows that and I am only repeating what everybody knows. As regards the money market, I have nothing special to say in this respect. I would only mention that we have taken recently decisions together with the Federal Reserve and also with the Swiss National Bank. We had made that public. I think that these are proof of transatlantic cooperation that has been welcomed by the markets. We will continue to follow the situation very carefully. As you know, we have felt from the very beginning that we had a responsibility to contribute to a smooth functioning of the money market. But the tensions that we have seen and we are still seeing on both sides of the Atlantic originated outside the money market. So that it was not up to us alone to eliminate these tensions, but to contribute to a smooth functioning of the money market. On the bias, I will stick to what I have already said, that we have no bias. Second, a colleague of yours on the Governing Council said recently, if I have got this quote right, that “it is a mistake to think that inflation will fall if the economy weakens”. Do you agree with that statement and is that the sentiment of the Governing Council? And third: perhaps you have the results of the second quarter bank lending survey with you today. Would you be able to give us a glimpse of those results? If so, let us know whether there is a further tightening of lending standards and whether there is any more thought on the Governing Council on this apparent discrepancy between still strong non-financial corporation lending growth and tightening standards? I confirm that the trough that had been defined a month ago was a trough for the mid-year, for the second and third quarters. There is absolutely no reason not to confirm that. The information we have gained over the past month confirms that. Again, I will not say anything more than that at this stage. I will give you figures at the next meeting with our new staff projections. Our position is clear on the fact that we had identified risks, the fact that some of those risks are materialising and the fact that we see reasons for the materialisation of those risks that are, as I have already indicated, the slowdown of the global economy in particular, and the drain on our economy as a result of the development of the commodity, oil and food prices. All are elements that explain what we are observing at the moment. As regards inflation, once again, we have only one needle in our compass and we take absolutely all information that is pertinent into consideration to identify the risk of inflation in the months and years to come. And, as always, we look at simply everything. The level of demand is part of this analysis, as is the monetary analysis, the level of exchange rates and so forth. So, we have to, as always, work out a synthesis. On the bank lending survey, we will – as generally it is the case – publish the bank lending survey tomorrow. What I can tell you at this stage is that we have seen a somewhat lower net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase, but a somewhat greater net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households, although starting from a lower level. We have, if everything is taken into account, a somewhat lower net tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises than that observed in the first quarter. But these are not major changes and there is still a significant tightening of credit according to the bank lending survey. So, I would say, more or less the same level of tightening, but perhaps a little less net tightening. You mentioned the credit dynamism. We are still observing a level of dynamism as regards credit and counterparts of monetary aggregates that remains important. It has been published, so that there is nothing new for you there. But it is true, as high as these figures are that loans to non-financial corporations continue to grow at a rate – according to our last observation – of 13.6%. There has been a reduction in comparison with the previous month. We were at 14.2%, so that the rate is diminishing, but only slightly. We are seeing loans to households and loans to finance house purchase that are at a much lower rate of growth with a further reduction of outstanding credit because in the case of the loans for households we now have a level of 4.2%, after 4.9% in the previous month. So we have a significant slowdown. And for loans for house purchase, we – not surprisingly – have a strong decrease from 5.6% in the previous month to, most recently, 4.4%. But, if everything is taken into account, the dynamism of loans to non-financial corporations has given us an overall level of lending to the private sector that is still very dynamic and I would say again that, in that domain too, we have to be respectful and pragmatic and will have to see what the facts and the figures are. We will continue to look at them with extreme care. My second question is – and I just want to confirm that I’m reading this statement right: You noted in the risks to price stability “increasing indirect effects on consumer prices”, and I have in my mind that you used the word “pass-through” as well. I believe that this is a change from last month, and I was wondering if you could elaborate on why that went into the statement. My third question, just to follow up on what my colleague asked, is: Why is slower growth – and as you’ve said, you anticipated the risks and they have materialised – not listed in the statement as a downside risk to inflation? That would seem to me to be, prima facie, a factor that we have to consider. First of all, as regards our decision last month, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, all the information that has become available since our last meeting has, in our judgement, underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase rates in July. Everything that we have observed as regards inflationary risks has fully justified what we have done. I would say that, particularly as regards inflation expectations, all the information we have confirms that we were right to do what we did. As regards inflation, I don’t see that there’s any comment to make. Our analysis is exactly the same as before, and you should not over-interpret any changes that you might have noticed. We are in a universe where we see all the risks that I have listed. They are exactly the same kinds of risk that were listed before. We see a pipeline effect in a number of other prices stemming from increases in the prices of inputs – particularly commodities – and that is something which is ongoing and undoubtedly creates more risks. We have the risk of second-round effects and the absolute necessity to avoid the materialisation of such risks. Again I see that we have a situation which is not of a different nature. As regards your third question, again we had ourselves already priced in the fact that we would have a trough in the second and third quarters, so we will see what exactly happens. We are totally pragmatic, and this is one element which, of course, needs to be incorporated in our synthetic analysis. Let me nevertheless make one or two observations. Economists would tell you that the considerable changes we have observed in relative prices not only have the conjunctural effect of acting as a drain on the resources of the euro area and other consumer economies, but also change the overall growth potential of those economies, because you have a change in relative prices, which has a big impact on the productive sector itself and its capacity to produce. It seems to me that a number of effects in this respect are not taken into account by part of the analysis which is being done. So I would draw your attention to that point, too. There is not only a conjunctural effect, but also a structural effect. As you know, from the outset we considered this to be a very serious market correction. We took decisions which were in line with the analysis that we were facing an important market correction with episodes of turbulence. We never considered that there was a “quick fix” that could allow us to resolve that situation, and everything that has happened since then has proved that our analysis was right. The central banks are cooperating. I’ve mentioned further examples of that cooperation. The Eurosystem has always been very alert in following everything that has happened as efficiently as possible. I am asked very frequently whether the worst is now over or whether we should expect further enormous difficulties in the future. I would stick to what I have always said, namely that it’s an ongoing, very important market correction with episodes of turbulence and high levels of volatility, and that it is absolutely no time for complacency. That, for me, would be the best definition. You have not mentioned the collateral issue but it is, of course, part of the interaction we have with the money market. I told you last time – and I will stick to that – that we consider that our collateral framework has served us pretty well since the beginning of this turbulence. In a way, we were perhaps more prepared for the turbulence than some others, because we had also the capacity to accept private paper as collateral, the primary difference between us and a number of other institutions. We had the capacity to refinance commercial banks over three months, which was not necessarily the case in other economic areas. We had, since the establishment of the Eurosystem and the euro, traditionally had a very large number of counterparts, which proved to be very useful in the circumstances, and we also, traditionally, had a large amount of outstanding of refinancing, which also proved useful in the circumstances. So, these were the various elements which allowed us to cope with this unpredictable situation from the outset. That being said, we are examining our rules with great care and watching developments carefully. And we will see what we have to do, if it proves necessary, to refine elements of our scheme – as we have done in the past, because we did that two years ago and four years ago. So, it’s just as I said last time, I have nothing new to tell you and that would be my comment on that. And second question: Do you have any advice for the IMF concerning their global analysis? First of all, it seems to me that the IMF was cautious in mentioning this. However, we do not agree with the IMF on this. We consider our two-pillar strategy to have served us extremely well. On a number of occasions I have explained why we consider the information from the monetary analysis to be very pertinent and how it has helped us to take decisions in difficult times and at difficult moments. And, presently, I can say that these decisions are considered by everybody to have been fully vindicated. In particular, I mention our decision to refuse to decrease in rates in 2004 and our decision to increase rates in December 2005. These decisions were very significantly helped by our monetary analysis and were certainly very important in strategic terms. Let me also point out that there is a paradox in this position, because increasingly I have been hearing praise among economists for the monetary analysis and the two-pillar strategy. It seems to me that, at the current juncture, we are in a somewhat different universe to that of ten or even five years ago. Furthermore, it is paradoxical because, the European Parliament said that it judged the two-pillar strategy to be a very good concept. Reference was made to this in the European Parliament’s resolution which was adopted recently. So, to conclude, I would ask the IMF to do its very important job, and I am in no doubt that it will continue to do the job very well. We would be as public as possible. But, in any case, we regularly have to do some updating and there is nothing special to say in this regard, in terms of communication. So, you will see when the time comes. No, at this stage, I cannot refer to analytic work that would respond to your question. First of all, I am not sure at all that this is the position of the Head of State of France. I saw that in a paper, but referring to a conversation with aides. I myself do not comment on rumours or leaks that are not confirmed. The publication of minutes would be a paradox because the last resolution of the European Parliament (on the ECB) mentions that the European Parliament understands why we are not publishing minutes. They ask us to be as transparent as possible; they ask, in particular, that, in this candid exchange that we have, we be even more transparent. I try to be as transparent as possible, as you know, and we are proud that our predecessors, Wim Duisenberg and Christian Noyer, gave us – to Lucas Papademos and me – the concept of this interaction, because it did not exist before the setting up of the euro, as you are aware. There was no central bank in the world engaging in immediate, real-time communication after the decision of the Governing Council. So, in terms of transparency we have been bold since the very beginning of the euro. And we continue to try to be exemplary in this respect, as this interaction is demonstrating. But again, the European Parliament said that they understood why we were cautious as regards the publication of minutes. We have no bias. We are never pre-committed. We do always what is necessary to deliver price stability in the medium term. I have said no more today than what I said a month ago. So, do not assume anything, but see it as a reminder of the terms of reference that I have for this particular issue. "
2008-07-03,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was taken to prevent broadly based second-round effects and to counteract the increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term. HICP inflation rates have continued to rise significantly since the autumn of last year. They are expected to remain well above the level consistent with price stability for a more protracted period than previously thought. Moreover, continued very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence thus far of significant constraints on bank loan supply in a context of ongoing financial market tensions confirm our assessment of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. At the same time, while the latest data confirm the expected weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008 after exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. Against this background and in full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. This will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and continue to support sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. On the basis of our current assessment, the monetary policy stance following today’s decision will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Information that has become available since the June press conference confirms our previous expectation of rather weak real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2008, in part as a technical counter-reaction to the strong quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8% in the first quarter. As we have stressed previously, the quarterly growth rates for the first half of this year have been subject to strong temporary and compensatory factors, notably weather-related effects on the profile of construction activity. Therefore, in order to assess the underlying momentum of euro area economic activity and to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly outturns, it is necessary to evaluate the first two quarters of 2008 together. Interpreted on this basis, the information available remains broadly in line with our expectation of moderate ongoing growth. Looking ahead, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support real GDP growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. While moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from continued robust growth in emerging economies. This should support euro area external demand. As regards domestic developments, the fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. In this context, investment growth in the euro area should continue to support economic activity, as rates of capacity utilisation remain elevated and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained. Moreover, employment rates and labour force participation have increased significantly in recent years, and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. However, these developments, which support household disposable income and consumption, are unlikely to fully compensate the loss of purchasing power caused by higher energy and food prices. In the view of the Governing Council, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity remains high, owing not least to the very high levels of commodity prices, and downside risks prevail. In particular, risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. Moreover, downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the ongoing financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than anticipated. Concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also imply downside risks to the outlook for economic activity. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained well above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, reaching 3.7% in May 2008 and – according to Eurostat’s flash estimate – 4.0% in June. This worrying level of inflation rates results largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain well above 2% for quite some time, moderating only gradually in 2009. We are thus currently experiencing a protracted period of high annual rates of inflation, which is likely to be more persistent than anticipated some months ago. Risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon remain clearly on the upside and have increased further over the past few months. These risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices. There is also a very strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures via broadly based second-round effects. The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. Furthermore, there are potential upside risks from unanticipated rises in indirect taxes and administered prices. Against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. The shift in relative prices and the related transfer of income from commodity-importing countries to commodity-exporting countries have to be accepted. They require a change in the behaviour of companies and households. Therefore, broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. All parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, must meet their responsibilities in this regard. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. In line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. Over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. Against this background, the continued strength of monetary dynamics represents an important signal of the risks to price stability over the medium term that we have been addressing through our actions since end-2005, including today’s move. More specifically, annual M3 growth has remained very vigorous in recent months, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. Although annual M3 growth of still above 10% overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion, owing to the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors, nonetheless, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. The current structure of yields has triggered substitution both within and into the broad monetary aggregate M3, leading to a pronounced decline in annual M1 growth and very rapid increases in time deposits. At the same time, higher short-term interest rates have served to moderate the growth of household borrowing, although cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area have also played a substantial role in this regard. However, the growth of bank loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust despite the rises in short-term rates. While some moderation can be expected in the future in the light of tightening financing conditions and more moderate economic growth, bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.2% in May 2008, and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong. Not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets, the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons. Moreover, a thorough assessment of the money and credit data has provided an important insight into bank behaviour and financing conditions. In particular, the strength, maturity and sectoral composition of bank borrowing suggest that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the tensions. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence thus far of significant constraints on bank loan supply. At the same time, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate ongoing real GDP growth when the high volatility of growth rates in the first half of this year is taken properly into account. Against this background and in full accordance with our mandate, it is imperative that we prevent broadly based second-round effects and counteract the increasing risks to price stability. We emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. On the basis of our current assessment, the monetary policy stance following today’s decision will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, budgetary consolidation targets are at risk in a number of euro area countries. Moreover, the risk of countries’ budget deficits coming close to or even exceeding the 3% of GDP reference value has increased. The Governing Council therefore reiterates its strong support for a rigorous implementation of euro area governments’ 2008 budgets and a prudent design of fiscal policy plans for 2009, in line with the agreement in the Eurogroup in May 2008. Achieving and maintaining sound structural fiscal positions is essential to ensure the sustainability of public finances as well as to create scope for the free working of automatic stabilisers in all euro area countries and thereby contribute to the smoothing of cyclical fluctuations. As regards structural reforms, we reiterate our full support for all efforts to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster market flexibility. In view of the marked increase in international food commodity prices, removing impediments to competition at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors would benefit European consumers through lower prices. As regards labour markets, let me direct your attention to the ECB’s 2008 Structural Issues Report, which was recently submitted to the European Parliament. It emphasises the generally favourable labour market developments in the euro area over the last decade but equally points out the urgent need to counter the ageing-related reduction in the labour force, in particular by increasing employment in all groups of society, by making labour markets more flexible and by enhancing investment in education and training. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * And the second question, if I may, as far as second-round effects are concerned, we’re all talking about the danger of second-round effects, but isn’t that a case of mission creep? Haven’t we already seen them on the fringes? Whether it is energy prices that are passed on by the likes of Lufthansa or whether it is wage demands, etc. Aren’t the second-round effects already there and it’s just that we don’t want to talk about it? In answer to your first question, the remarks I just made on behalf of the Governing Council speak for themselves. Against the present background and on the basis of our present assessment, we believe that the monetary policy stance after today’s decision will contribute to achieving our objective of price stability. Starting from here, I have no bias. You are aware of our constant position, which is fully part of our monetary policy handling. We make no pre-commitment on the medium term and we do always what is necessary to deliver price stability in line with our definition in the medium term. I insist on both “the medium term” and “in line with our definition”. And we do what is necessary to be credible in this delivery in order to solidly anchor inflation expectations in line with our definition. As regards your second question, which was on second-round effects, our message is the same as it has been since the very beginning of these increases in the prices of commodities, the price of oil and more recently the price of food. We are solemnly telling all economic agents, corporate businesses, price-setters in the economy and social partners that the worst decision they could take would be precisely to believe that what we are observing today, namely this protracted period of high inflation, will last in the medium term. On the contrary – we are there precisely with a mandate from the European people to deliver price stability below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. They can have confidence that we are there to deliver that level of price stability and to solidly anchor inflation expectations. We believe that what we did today and what we did before is precisely there to enable us to deliver price stability in the medium term. And am I right in interpreting when you say you have no bias that you are not ruling out that further increases may be needed, because at the moment the inflation outlook is deteriorating even more – the oil price hit a new record, inflation expectations on the five-year break-even on French bonds today hit another record, so the picture is still fairly gloomy. In answer to the first question, we were unanimous, taking into account all the information that we have and all the information that we received between the last meeting and today’s meeting. What I said on behalf of the Governing Council speaks for itself. The monetary policy stance after today’s decision will contribute to achieving our objective of price stability. I have no bias and we are never pre-committed, as you know. It is a constant feature of our monetary policy and we do what is necessary to deliver price stability in the medium term, and to be credible in that delivery. Let me go back to the question you asked, because the two are closely linked: we saw from our analysis that risks had augmented and this was the reason why we took today’s decision. I would not say that we are satisfied by all the decisions that have been taken, either by price-setters in Europe or by social partners, but we are solemnly telling them that they can count on us to guarantee price stability in the medium term, to deliver price stability in the medium term and to solidly anchor inflation expectations. It is our mandate, it is our duty. This position is commanded by our mandate and by the decision of the people of Europe. We are doing what the Treaty calls upon us to do. It is also what the people of Europe are asking us to do today. If you look at the most recent surveys, you will see that inflation is now the number one concern of our 320 million fellow citizens. They are counting on us to be the anchor of price stability in a period which is obviously very demanding. They can count on us. They can have confidence in the fact that the Governing Council of the ECB will do what is necessary in accordance with its mandate, and that confidence is essential at the present juncture. It is essential that households have confidence that we will preserve price stability and that the most vulnerable and poorest of our fellow citizens can count on the fact that we will deliver price stability in the medium term. It is important that corporate businesses understand that their own contracts will not be changed by the level of inflation in the medium and long run. And it is extremely important, as I have already told you, that investors and savers continue to have confidence that their own investments and savings will be preserved. Take a look at the issuance of treasuries on a 50-year basis. What credibility is the 50-year issuance of treasuries based on, if not on our own credibility, in the eyes of the investors and savers in Europe and in the world and on our capacity to deliver price stability in line with our definition over a very long period of time? First of all, at the mid-point of this year, we do not have a rate of growth that is flattering. That is clear and I warn you in advance that the second quarter will be very different from the first quarter. The two quarters must be taken into account together, because we clearly had a very flattering first quarter, which will certainly not be mirrored in the second quarter. And I can say that the third quarter will probably not be particularly flattering either. That being said, the information we have at our disposal permits the Governing Council to trust that its assessment of moderate ongoing growth is appropriate at the time of speaking. But I also told you that the risks were on the downside. That being said, let me just mention one point, one piece of information available, namely that on a yearly basis outstanding credits – outstanding loans – to non-financial corporates were still growing at the level of 14.2%. Remember, I mentioned figures which were even higher: the figure for April was 14.9%. So it is slowing down a little bit, but only a little bit as you can see. When we look at growth over a three-month period in order to try to capture the more immediate trend, we still have figures that are very dynamic and much more dynamic than the rate of growth of the GDP of the euro area in value terms. So, we have to synthesise a large array of information, and that drives us to qualify the situation as one of moderate ongoing growth, taking into account the downward risks I mentioned. That being said, do not forget that, for us, there are not two needles in our compass; there is only one needle in our compass. Taking everything into account, where exactly is the needle that captures the risks to price stability? It is according to the analysis of all the risks to price stability that we take our own decision. And you can see what our present analysis was today. It is clear. We trust that we had to increase the rates of our monetary policy stance by 25 basis points and we trust that this will contribute to delivering price stability in the medium term. Now let me make a thought experiment for a moment. If we did not have that needle in our compass and instead had another needle, the natural consequences would probably be that inflation expectations would go up. Inflation expectations going up, the unanchoring of inflation expectations would start and then all of our medium and long-term market interest rates would go up. The interest rates of 50-year treasuries – as I mentioned before – which at the moment of speaking are probably around 4.9%, would be much higher with the unanchoring of inflation expectations. So, again, we do not see any contradiction between the mandate that we have and sustainable growth and job creation. That a rate hike would be translated into higher inflation expectations? No, I don’t think that this could be the case. The fact that we have not mentioned “heightened alertness” or “strong vigilance” doesn’t mean anything. We said clearly last time that it was possible but not certain that we would increase rates today. You see what we have decided unanimously today. We will communicate in a fashion which, as always, will be clear and permit observers, our fellow citizens and markets to see what we will do. I never comment on future markets. I said already that we have no bias. We are not pre-committed. We do whatever is necessary to deliver price stability. Secondly, again notwithstanding your strong suggestion at last month’s meeting that you would in fact raise your interest rate, which you did today, inflation expectations as measured by the market, many market measures, rose quite sharply. You’ve said today that you have no bias. Do you worry, given this backdrop that those inflation expectations will rise yet more sharply? And finally, last month I wonder whether you were surprised by the sharp yield curve inversion that followed your press conference, and whether or not you see potential losses from banks on the basis of that yield curve as yet another risk to financial stability and in line with further bank write-downs and ongoing money market tensions? I have nothing to add, what I said spoke for itself. There is nothing new. You know that I have always said since I was appointed President – and my predecessor did the same – we are not pre-committed. This institution operates like that. Others can pre-commit, perhaps, either to go up or to go down or to stay at their level for a considerable period of time. It is not the way we operate. It’s part of our own handling of monetary policy. We are not pre-committed and we do what is necessary to deliver price stability in the medium term. It is what we did today. I don’t underestimate that when I said clearly on behalf of the Governing Council that it was possible to increase rates today, it was considered an important message. It proves that we take seriously the anchoring of inflation expectations and our responsibility vis-à-vis our fellow citizens. It also proves that they can trust us when we say that we will maintain price stability in the medium term. Confidence is absolutely of the essence at the present juncture. We consider ourselves as an anchor of stability and an anchor of confidence. I call upon all market participants, economic agents and authorities to take into account that confidence is absolutely of the essence at the present juncture. And then the second question is just whether you can tell us at all what you and Treasury Secretary Paulson may have talked about on Tuesday. Was there any particular message you sent him back to Washington with? I have already said that the situation at the present moment is naturally not identical with what we observed in 1973 and 1974, at the moment of the first oil shock or, at the end of the 1970s, with the second oil shock, even if there are some similarities. So let us beware of oversimplifying the situation. We are in a situation which is very complex, with one major difference, which was that the first oil shock was really a supply-driven shock engineered by the cartel of the suppliers. What we have seen up to now is very much a demand-driven shock. That being said, there are similarities. One important similarity is that we have known since the first oil shocks that those who let inflation gallop, those who think that they can embark on second-round exercises because they want to deny that there is a transfer of resources from consumers to suppliers, are paving the way for a long period of a high level of inflation, slow growth, stagnation and unemployment at a higher and higher level. There was full employment in Europe before the first oil shock, and at the end of the 1970s we had dramatic mass unemployment which we are only starting to get out of. So that is a similarity and that is why in particular we are so attached to our message on ‘no second-round effects’. Not only because it is an absolute necessity to permit us to deliver price stability in the medium term, but because it is essential not to lose the success in job creation and the diminishing of unemployment that we had up to now. It is a very important matter in terms of jobs. As regards the meeting the Vice-President and I had with US Treasury Secretary Paulson, it was a broad tour d’horizon, very useful certainly. And I think Hank Paulson has explained very well what we were discussing. And secondly, looking forward, you are obviously aware that the markets will interpret your comment that today’s decision will “contribute to achieving our objective” as a sign that at the moment no further moves are envisaged. You have not gone beyond that in comments so far, but I wonder if you could give us a reassurance that, as you have in the past, the ECB will strive to be as predictable as possible. So, therefore, if we are to have another move in the pipeline, we will have some phrase “heightened alertness”, “strong vigilance”, in the month ahead. First to your second question, the message I gave is clear and I will not comment again on that. If and when we have something new to give to the market, we will certainly do that, as we have always done in the past. We will certainly do that in a clear fashion that will permit us to be as predictable in the future as we have been in the past. So I can reassure you fully on that. We believe that this move upward is the kind of move that was necessary to permit us to continue to tell our fellow citizens “You can have confidence that we will deliver price stability in the medium term despite the very difficult circumstances in which we are, particularly because of the very strong increase in the price of a number of commodities.” I would like to take advantage of your question to ask again, as I have already done, all those who have a responsibility in this commodities market. Firstly, the consumers: our message is clear for them. We have anomalies concerning the high level of subsidies, which prevent in a number of economies - not only industrialised but also emerging market economies - the ultimate consumers from taking into account the real price of energy as it is. So a lot of progress has to be made in this direction for the prices to be fully reflected at the level of the ultimate consumers. We will still have in certain economies abnormal buying demand which is not corrected as it should be with the new prices at a global level. Secondly, we also tell the suppliers that, to the extent that part of the present prices come from a cartel, this is very abnormal. At the present juncture, at the global level, when we have a demand-driven increase in prices, then it plays a role in the automatic stabilisation of global growth. But if we have a supplier-driven artificial scarcity, then it is very grave and it has an impact which could be very grave at the level of the global economy. Let me also say that the industrialised countries have their responsibilities in this respect. There are a number of industrialised countries that are preventing drilling and exploration of new fields and that also contributes to the global difficulty. And finally, markets have to be as transparent and as competitive as possible. This is something which has to be as much as possible resolutely improved. On your first question, no, I have nothing to say on what you said about those who have given us advice. We are an independent institution. Everybody knows that we are an independent institution. Our credibility relies entirely on the fact that we make our judgement on the basis of all information we have. The 21 members of the Governing Council take their decision to the best of their analysis and conscience and they know the responsibility that they have vis-à-vis 320 million fellow citizens. They also know that the Treaty applied was decided by all our 27 democracies including those that have an opt-out clause. It is extraordinarily important that the level of confidence that we can give our fellow European citizens is well preserved by the fact that we are fully independent. And à propos pro-cyclical movement, somebody during the weekend said interest rates would have a pro-cyclical effect on growth, which is already slowing down, and that your move today would have an impact in the mid-term, that’s to say next year, when growth will already be slowing more strongly. And that’s why some suggest that you should have waited longer to hike rates because inflation will be slowed already by the slowing growth. What do you think of that? On the first point, I think that at the present moment nobody says that we are embarking on a stagflation episode at the global level. The global economy is growing. And part of the pressures on a number of commodities is coming precisely from this global growth. There is a level of slowing down in a number of economies, that’s clear, but significant global growth is there. At a global level we have inflation but we don’t have stagnation. On your second point, in the industrialised world, you have to look country by country. Each of us is in a different situation. The United States is not the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom and the United States are not the euro area. As I have already mentioned with all due respect to the risks that are ahead of us, which I clearly pointed out, our present assessment is of a moderate, ongoing growth. Furthermore, we have to look at the first and the second quarters of this year together. As regards the present moment, we consider that it is necessary for us to increase rates today. I said that we had no bias for the future, with the qualification that we are not pre-committed and that we always do whatever is necessary to deliver price stability. The unanimity of the members of the Governing Council on today’s decision is important. Let me also say that the fact that we are credible is part of ongoing growth and job creation in the euro area. If we were not credible, where would our five-year, 10-year, 20-year, 30-year or 50-year rates be? All rely upon the credibility of this institution. I said already that we were an independent institution and we were concentrating on our responsibility vis-à-vis our 320 million fellow citizens in obviously demanding circumstances. We do what we believe we have to do. In our monetary policy decisions we take absolutely everything into account – by definition. All parameters are taken into account including, certainly, exchange rates together with all others. And let me say that we are convinced that sharp fluctuations between major currencies could have implications for economic and financial stability. This is the belief of all of us, and everybody knows that I consider it extremely important that the US authorities – the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Fed – say that a strong US dollar is in the interest of the United States. In my opinion it is unfortunately the case of a number of countries, and not only for drilling and exploration, as I already said, but also for permitting the new refineries that are necessary for products – including light products – to be processed. So, we have to look carefully at all these issues in the industrialised world itself. But it’s a general problem. I know that this has been discussed among governments. To my knowledge, governments in the Eurogroup are against any general measure that would go against taking into account the new prices and have a negative impact on the behaviour of consumers by encouraging them to consume more than they would do otherwise. As regards the particular attention being paid to the poorest or the most vulnerable of our fellow citizens, I know that it is being examined, but at this stage I have no further information. I would say it’s a general problem for all members of the euro area. It’s particularly true for those who have indexation schemes, and I was very clear on the fact that indexation schemes were extremely dangerous for obvious reasons in this respect. Furthermore, the best way to increase unemployment would be precisely to embark on these second-round effects. So, it’s for all countries, with particular attention to those who have indexation schemes and also, more generally, those who are less flexible. It’s absolutely clear that flexibility of wages in the present circumstances is very important if we want to preserve price stability and job creation. And then a slightly different question: I noted that one bank has had securities backed by Australian car loans accepted by the ECB. Do you think that the ECB rules surrounding acceptable collateral need to be refined now? On the first question: again, if we have increased rates today, it is because we consider that, taking everything into account, risks to price stability had augmented and we had to counter these risks to price stability. On our collateral framework, we consider that it has served us very well since the beginning of the financial turbulence. We are permanently examining and applying our rules with great care, and looking carefully at all that happens. We will see what we have to do, if it is necessary to refine elements in our scheme, as we did in the past, two and four years ago. But till now it has served the euro area very well and, as you know, it was considered even at the beginning of the turbulence as some kind of role model in some respects for central banks. We are concentrating on what depends on us. The second-round effects depend on us. By ""us"", I mean the economic agents of the euro area: social partners, corporate businesses, the productive sector and, naturally, authorities. We do not pretend that we have the capacity ourselves to correct the price of commodities that have a global reach and have global prices. But we are taking into account what is within our own reach and I refer again to the issue of the similarities to the first oil shock. You could see the difference between those economies which considered that they could not do anything and those which considered that they could preserve price stability in the medium term. We are always reasoning over the medium term. When I say that we will deliver price stability, I add immediately ""in the medium term"". 320 million fellow citizens are calling upon us to provide them price stability in the medium term. The reason for this is not only that they had decided earlier that we should deliver price stability – let’s not forget, we have a mandate given by the exemplary democracies of the EU 27 – but also because the period is such that they are calling even more insistently on us, and we will respond to this frank request of our fellow citizens. "
2008-06-05,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. This week we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the ECB, marking an important milestone in the development of this institution and of the single monetary policy. On that occasion I expressed my sincere thanks to all those who have helped to build a solid foundation for the euro. Let me also extend these thanks to you who play such an important role in transmitting our decisions and explanations to the financial markets and to the public at large. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. At the same time, we noted that risks to price stability over the medium term have increased further. Inflation rates have risen significantly since the autumn of last year, owing mainly to strong increases in energy and food prices. HICP inflation is now expected to remain high for a more protracted period than previously thought. Upside risks to price stability over the medium term are also confirmed by the continuing very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence of significant constraints on bank loan supply up to now. At the same time, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. Against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. The Governing Council is monitoring very closely all developments. It is in a state of heightened alertness. By acting in a firm and timely manner, we will prevent second-round effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. It is our strong determination to secure a firm anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. At a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8%, real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2008 was well above expectations. In part, this strength reflected temporary factors, notably the unusually mild winter in many parts of Europe, which appears to have boosted construction activity. However, the high growth rate in the first quarter might be partly offset in the second. It is therefore more appropriate, in order to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly results, to evaluate the first two quarters of 2008 together. In line with available forecasts, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real GDP growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. While moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from continued robust growth in emerging economies. This should support euro area external demand. The fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound, and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. Against this background, we expect investment growth in the euro area to provide ongoing support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation remains solid and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained. Moreover, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly, and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. These developments support disposable income, although purchasing power is being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices. This outlook is also reflected in the June 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2008 and between 1.0% and 2.0% in 2009. In comparison with the March ECB staff projections, the current range projected for real GDP growth in 2008 is within the upper part of the range published in March 2008, mainly as a consequence of the better than expected outcome in the first quarter. For 2009, the range has been adjusted downwards, following the increase in commodity prices over recent months. The year-on-year growth rates which I have just mentioned need to be interpreted with particular caution on this occasion. While the annual rates suggest that growth may be weaker in 2009 than in 2008, they mask the fact that on a quarterly basis real GDP growth is projected to reach a trough in 2008, before gradually recovering thereafter. In order not to draw the wrong conclusions about the growth dynamics implied in the staff projections it is important to keep this distinction in mind. In the Governing Council’s view, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high, and downside risks prevail. In particular, risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market turbulence to have a more negative impact on the real economy than anticipated. Moreover, downside risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. Risks also arise from concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained above 3% for the past seven months. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, it was 3.6% in May 2008. This confirms the more persistent current upward pressures on euro area inflation, resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain above 3% for some time to come, before moderating only gradually in 2009. We are thus currently experiencing a protracted period of high annual rates of inflation, which is likely to be more persistent than previously anticipated. Consistent with this view, the Eurosystem staff projections foresee average annual HICP inflation at between 3.2% and 3.6% in 2008 and between 1.8% and 3.0% in 2009. Compared with the March 2008 ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for inflation in 2008 and 2009 are markedly higher, reflecting mainly higher oil and food prices and increasingly inflationary pressures in the services sector. In this context, it is important to recall the conditional nature of the Eurosystem staff projections. They are based on a number of assumptions which are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. In particular, the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates are taken from market expectations as at mid-May. Moreover, it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumption that the recent dynamism in oil and non-oil commodity prices will diminish over the projection horizon, in line with futures prices. A further crucial assumption is that there will be no broad-based second-round effects on wages. In the Governing Council’s view, at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon risks to the outlook for prices remain clearly on the upside and have increased further These risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices, as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. It is also a strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures. The pricing power of firms, particularly in market segments with low competition, such as parts of the services sector, may prove stronger than currently expected. Moreover, higher than expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation, tight labour market conditions and the risk of second-round effects. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations and price-setting behaviour in the euro area with particular attention. Against this background, it is imperative to secure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. All parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, must meet their responsibilities. Wage-setting needs to take into account productivity developments, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, and price competitiveness positions. Moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years. Broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth remained very vigorous in April, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. While the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors suggest that annual M3 growth continues to overstate the underlying pace of monetary expansion, nonetheless, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. Annual M1 growth has continued to moderate in recent months, reflecting higher short-term interest rates which have encouraged further shifts from overnight into time deposits. The moderation in the growth of household borrowing also reflects the dampening impact of higher short-term interest rates, as well as cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. However, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. While some moderation can be expected in the future in the light of tightening financing conditions and slower economic growth, bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.9% in April 2008, and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong. The monetary analysis has helped to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy in the face of the ongoing financial turmoil. From this perspective, the monetary analysis points to upside risks to price stability at longer horizons. Moreover, a thorough assessment of the monetary counterparts suggests that, as yet, the availability of bank credit to households and non-financial corporations has not been significantly affected by the turmoil. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence of significant constraints on bank loan supply up to now. In fact, we noted that risks to price stability over the medium term have increased further. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. Against this background, the Governing Council is monitoring very closely all developments. It is in a state of heightened alertness. By acting in a firm and timely manner, we will prevent second-round effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Securing a firm anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability is of the essence. Regarding fiscal policy, the Governing Council welcomes the spring 2008 orientations for euro area fiscal policies agreed by the Eurogroup ministers on 13 May 2008. Many euro area governments still need to implement much more ambitious policies to ensure that their country-specific medium-term budgetary objectives are attained by 2010 at the latest, as agreed in Berlin in April 2007. Achieving and maintaining sound structural fiscal positions is imperative to create scope for the free working of automatic stabilisers in all euro area countries and will help to prepare for the budgetary costs of population ageing. The steady pursuit of prudent and efficient fiscal policies would also help to limit current inflationary pressures and would increase potential growth and employment. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council reiterates its full support for all efforts to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster market flexibility. Against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices, removing impediments to competition at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors would benefit European consumers through lower prices. The ongoing “health check” of the EU common agricultural policy is welcomed, as are the efforts to limit upward pressure on agricultural prices through biofuels policies. A successful conclusion of the Doha round of world trade negotiations should also help to improve the functioning of global trade in general and of agricultural markets in Europe and worldwide in particular. Tax policies are not an appropriate means to counter commodity price increases, be it oil or non-oil commodities, as this would send wrong signals to producers and consumers alike and would distort markets. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * And my final question is, could you comment on Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s remarks that he supports a strong dollar which I think also followed the same remarks by treasury officials? As I said on behalf of the Governing Council in the introductory remarks, the Governing Council is in a state of heightened alertness. We had a very good and in-depth discussion, as always, in the Governing Council. We took into account all the information that we had; the projections of the staff of the Eurosystem and the risks to price stability based on both the economic and the monetary analysis. And, all things being taken into account, I would sum up our state of mind by saying that we exchanged many opinions and views around the table, as always, with a very candid exposition of our analysis. A number of us thought that, all things being taken into account, all information and analysis of risks, we had a case for increasing rates. A number of us considered that there was a case for increasing rates, but at a later date, and some amongst us considered that there was not necessarily a case for doing so. After an in-depth exchange of views, we decided by consensus to take today’s decision, which means that we maintain rates and that we will monitor all developments very closely. We are in a state of heightened alertness. We consider that the possibility is not excluded that, after having carefully examined the situation, we could decide to move our rates by a small amount in our next meeting in order to secure the solid anchoring of inflation expectations, taking into account the situation. I don’t say it is certain, I say it is possible. As regards the US dollar and what Ben said, I have always appreciated what has been said by Ben, and particularly what he said last Monday about what he considered opportune from the US standpoint. It has been noted by markets as something important and I have frequently told you that I consider what has been said by Ben and by Hank Paulson, as regards the fact that a strong dollar was in the interests of the United States, to be very important. What counts is what the college decides and what the college thinks, not any individual, but the full body of the Governing Council. We had no unanimous views on the analysis and on what would be the best decision to take. As always, we exchanged all views, we compared our positions and finally we decided, by consensus, both to maintain rates as they are and, taking into account all the information we had, to put ourselves in the state of “heightened alertness”, which is the term of the Governing Council to characterise our situation. We will examine the situation very carefully and we will, in our next meeting, not exclude the possibility of increasing rates by a small amount. That is the situation which we are in: it is not certain, it is possible. Secondly, demand for your dollar-denominated auctions continues rising and on Tuesday hit another record, with the highest bid-cover rate of any auction since the inception of these dollar-denominated auctions. Are there considerations about further boosting the amount available? And similarly, we are approaching the end of the quarter and in the past the ECB Governing Council has decided that it was in their interests to offer market participants extra funding over these tense periods, would you consider that again? As regards the first question, we have had a collateral framework since the setting-up of the ECB which was more comprehensive and more complete, perhaps, than others. We introduced a number of improvements in the course of our early years, including the fact that we generalised this framework fully for the whole of the euro area – we started with quite different traditions. And we have not changed anything since the beginning of the financial turbulence. We consider that this framework has served us very well and, of course, we apply this collateral framework as efficiently and effectively as possible. As regards the Term Auction Facility, we are very happy with this very close cooperation with the Federal Reserve System. It would have to be carefully checked in historical terms, but it seems to me that it is a “ première”, this cooperation with the Federal Reserve System for delivering liquidity in dollars on this side of the Atlantic – involving not only us, but also the Swiss National Bank – and we are satisfied with the present way it functions. I will not comment now. We will certainly have occasions to restate to market participants how we will deal with this situation, which is a situation we have already encountered at the end of the year and at the end of the first quarter. We observed this behaviour and these tensions before. We will continue to operate fully in line with what we have done earlier. My question is: the position of the Governing Council, do you expect that the inflation rate will diminish to below 2% at the end of 2009? And the second question is: there were quite some discussions on the process of how LIBOR and EURIBOR rate settings were calculated. There were also some suggestions on how to tackle the problem, like with a focus on overnight index swaps. What is the position of the Governing Council on that? On the first question, we do not underwrite the staff projections. We take the staff projections as always – the Eurosystem staff projections at the present moment – as a very important input for us, but they should not be seen as the analysis of the Governing Council. We look at other projections and we could observe that the most recent surveys of other institutions, including the OECD, are very close to what our staff are saying. But that being said, it is an important input but it is not our position. Our position, I said it in the introductory remarks, is that the risks for price stability have further increased. As regards the primary mandate of the ECB and its Governing Council, it is to deliver price stability over the medium term. It is our duty to be able to tell our fellow citizens that we take at any moment the decisions that would permit the delivery of price stability over the medium term, and the medium term for a central bank is a period of 18 months to two years. So in that medium-term period at any moment we have to secure price stability. We would be, in our own analysis, at the level which is in line with our definition of price stability in the medium term, namely less than two, but close to two percent. And we have to be credible in this delivery of price stability and that is the reason why we insist so strongly on inflationary expectations remaining well anchored, in line with our definition of price stability. As regards your second question I will not engage in a discussion on LIBOR, EURIBOR and so forth. As far as EURIBOR is concerned, we have the feeling that the methodology which is utilised is correct and we do not dispute the quality of the figures that are produced. We observe, of course, that we have spreads in the money market and this is something that we have to look at carefully. At this stage all I can tell you is that all decisions we take will be designed to permit us to affirm that we will maintain price stability over that period. But I don’t give you a precise number of months. I give you a range from 18 months to two years. I don’t dispute that it would mean the beginning of 2010. And a second question to follow up: you’ve made a few comments recently about not repeating the mistakes of the 1970s. Is one of the lessons that it’s essential that central banks act rapidly to head off inflation dangers even if growth is slowing? On the first point, I never comment. I have already answered some similar questions. I think it would be totally absurd for me to comment in real-time on market reactions. I will not comment on a day-to-day basis or a week-to-week basis, thus no comment on real-time market reaction. Again we will look at the situation. We will make our decision at the moment of the decision. As you know we are never pre-committed. We always analyse the exact situation on the basis of all information we have at the moment when we take the decision. I said it is not excluded that we will take that decision at our next decision-making meeting, namely at the beginning of July. It is not certain; it is possible. As regards not repeating the mistakes of the past, it is, as you know, a general message that one has even if we are not in the situation of the first oil shock and not in the situation of the second oil shock. There are similarities. It’s not identical at all. But there are similarities and one of the major similarities of course is that we must avoid unanchoring inflation expectations, avoid putting economies in general in a situation where they are weakening their own growth potential, where they are observing slower growth and mass unemployment. And the lesson of the first oil shock was precisely that because there were a number of probable errors in the diagnosis of the situation, in Europe you can date from the first oil shock the start of much lower growth and mass unemployment. I already had occasions to explain that to you in this very room. But it is something which we are not alone in saying, of course. A large number of economists are also saying that, and I trust that governments that have the memory of these shocks are also very lucid as regards the dangers of the present situation. As far as we are concerned, things are for us simple: we have a mandate, we have the Treaty’s primary mandate, and the Governing Council has the mandate to act in order to be able to tell 320 million fellow citizens “We will deliver price stability over the medium term”. We have a protracted period with a high level of the Consumer Price Index for reasons that are obvious. It is up to us to take care that it goes down in the medium term to our definition of price stability. It’s very important for the confidence of our fellow citizens and the confidence of economic agents in general. And again, I repeat this because it’s the strong conviction of the Governing Council; those of our fellow citizens who are less able to protect themselves against inflation are the poorest and the most vulnerable. No. You said you had three questions. I am totally incompetent to answer the third question. I do not know whether Lucas… Papademos: Equally so. Again, I will say nothing more on your first question. We had a deep discussion with an exchange of all views. I would say the synapses function very well in our collective brain, and after the discussions, we reached today’s decision by consensus. As regards the money market, the tensions that we are observing are originating elsewhere. As you know, we have been extremely keen to do everything necessary to maintain policy rates close to those decided in our monetary policy stance. Since the very beginning of the turbulence, we have been, and will continue to be, very keen for our money market to function as well as possible, and with interest rates as close as possible, in the short term, to our policy rates. As far as the turbulence is concerned, it is ongoing, with episodes of high volatility, and of course we have to do everything necessary at the global level and the European level, according to the orientations which have already been approved by the international community, in particular the 67 recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum, which we have approved. Questions: Two questions, first one: Going back to the 1970s again, when there was not only the high oil price but also a decline in productivity in the Western world, which economists say also contributed to the stagflationary period. Do you see similarities? And of course which were not seen by central banks and policy-makers: Would you say that we are in a similar situation with respect to this issue now? And my second question is on the reasons for the high oil price. Do you think that this is just a real economic supply and demand phenomenon or did central banks probably contribute to the increases by leaving interest rates too low for too long? Thank you. On your first question, I have already said that there were similarities with the first oil shock. But, we were not in an identical situation in terms of the technological drive and the associated productivity progress that could be observed. We are not in the same situation at all. You are therefore absolutely right to underline that point. Let me only say that, as far as we are concerned at the ECB, the Governing Council considers that if we could continue to be active in implementing these structural reforms that we all agree to, we would certainly be able to much better exploit the potential for total factor productivity increases and labour productivity increases that are made possible in particular by technology. I would therefore say that one of the advantages of our present situation is that we have probably a large capacity to do much better in terms of productivity, which is one of the major goals of Europeans. As regards the oil price, I will not embark on a long exposition. It is a very complex phenomenon. It was obviously driven by demand at the beginning, and it is absolutely clear that the very rapid development of emerging countries is one of the main drivers. Supply is also playing a role and there are a number of reasons to think that there are also anomalies of a different nature on the supply side, including perhaps geo-strategic elements. But all that being said, it is a de facto situation that we have to cope with. We ourselves would call for all possible measures to be taken to save energy. We believe that we still have a lot to do at the global level. We would call for an as-good-as-possible functioning of the oil and energy market in general, as in all domains. It remains very important for all producers and consumers to take all their responsibilities in these difficult circumstances. I said that the projections of the Eurosystem staff are making the working assumption that we do not have broad-based second-round effects. That is the working assumption. We also have quite a diverse set-up, in this respect, with economies where we have some kind of indexation, and you know what our position is as regards indexation. Full indexation is a good way of having second-round effects! So, again, we have to remain very alert in this domain. Our message is clear and we have to be conscious of the fact that the enemy is the second-round effects in a situation such as this – this is clear and it is what we have said since the very beginning. And my second question is: what is the role of the monetary analysis in the monthly monetary policy decisions? First of all we are not behind the curve! We are, in the view of the Governing Council, at the appropriate position. We are very keen on being correctly positioned as regards our primary mandate and I am very strong on that. It does not seem to me that our reputation is that we are behind the curve, at least when I read various articles. As regards the staff projections the figures are the figures, and we have in front of us the figures that are the projections of our Eurosystem staff – not only the ECB staff but the whole of the Eurosystem staff – and they are, as I said, quite in line with the most recent other projections that I could see. As regards your second question on the monetary analysis, we consider the monetary analysis a very important pillar in our own monetary policy concept. I elaborated on the economic analysis and on the monetary analysis a moment ago, and I do not want to repeat what I already said – that we consider that the monetary analysis gives us very pertinent information. In the past, a number of decisions we took were inspired not only by the economic analysis but by the monetary analysis: in December 2005 in particular, when we increased rates and also at the beginning of 2004, when we did not decrease rates. In those two cases we were vindicated, even if the economic analysis did not necessarily suggest to do what we did. So, again, there are two complementary analyses that are for us very important, and in a world where we see the importance of financial matters, monetary analysis, with all its components and counterparts, is important. The second one is about the independence of central banks. Every time the economy slows down, there is big pressure on central banks to cut interest rates to support the economy in the short term certainly in Europe and we always have in Japan too. Do you think such a situation is improving facing the higher level of inflation? On second-round effects, again, our message is clear. We consider it is of the essence that we do not have those phenomena. I would also stress the fact that I’m not addressing only wage-price spiralling. I’m also addressing the issue of price setting. We have a number of sectors in which we could have abnormal price setting – and particularly those sectors where you do not have the level of competition that would permit the avoidance of such behaviour. I mention, in particular, the services sector, where we have to be particularly alert to avoid abnormal price setting. It would be abnormal precisely to take into account inflation today as if it was a good predictor of inflation tomorrow. It is not a good predictor for inflation tomorrow. A good predictor of inflation tomorrow is what our definition of price stability is. On the independence of central banks: of course, I don’t elaborate on our own institution. I had an occasion, last Monday, to quote Jean Monnet when he referred to men and women being indispensable, but for sustainable progress you need institutions. And we are an institution with its mandate and its independence. It’s very important. But let me tell you that it would be a mistake to think that we are engaging in an arbitrage between growth and price stability. If we were not sufficiently alert, and if we had an unanchoring of inflation expectations, then we would have a financial environment which would be adverse to sustainable growth and job creation. Because we would immediately have these new expectations incorporated in the medium and long-term market interest rates and they would go up and up and up, all things being equal. So we are working simultaneously for price stability and for sustainable growth and job creation. And I have to say our people understand that. They are not ready to trade inflation in the hope that we will have more growth and more job creation. Their common judgement is very close to that of the mainstream of economists at the moment I am speaking. We did not comment in our discussion on that particular point. What I understand is that the position of the Eurogroup and ECOFIN has been expressed by the President of the Eurogroup and the President of ECOFIN. And we strongly encourage them not to embark on tax policies that would counter commodity price increases because we believe it could be counterproductive. That I said on behalf of the Governing Council. And the other thing is, I did not take proper notes, did anyone actually call for rate increases today? And my final question is: you said that if you were to raise interest rates next month, it would be by a “small amount”, does that mean anything, does that mean you might deviate from the path of the 25 basis points that you have basically raised by over the last cycle? First of all, we consider that inflationary expectations are anchored and that we have to secure this anchoring, this is absolutely clear. When I said that a number of us were suggesting increases, it was for today. And on your last point, I would say that ""small"" would mean something of the order of magnitude of what we have done for the last decisions. You mean the state of mind that we have. We are permanently alert, and I said that very often and I even say that credible alertness is the hallmark of the concept of the ECB. So, being alert is our spontaneous natural state of mind. But I have explained a number of things that perhaps clarify what we had said in saying that we were in a state of heightened alertness. It would be also the adjective, which would count, not the substantive alone. Because it was our sentiment that we had to put ourselves in a state of “heightened alertness”, and we also had to monitor very closely all developments, that’s the reason. I will not elaborate more. Again, we decide when we have to decide, we take, as you know, at any moment the decision we judge as appropriate to counter inflationary risk. At the moment I am speaking, we consider that our decision today was a good decision to take and we consider it’s probably our duty to tell you in what state of mind we are, as regards the next meeting, but we will take our decision in the next meeting on the basis of all information we have at the moment of our decision. And again, taking stock of the collegial experience and wisdom that we have around the table – but I was sufficiently explicit on that, it seems to me. One more issue for your information: I would like to inform you on the procedure for the next meeting. We have decided that in the future, we would, as a rule, have our General Council meeting, which is every quarter the same day as the Governing Council, and we have decided that we would start– at five o’clock, say – with the Governing Council the day before, then we have the General Council on the morning of the second day, and then we will terminate our Governing Council. It will permit the Governing Council to have a little bit more time. So, for our next rendezvous, namely, 18 and 19 June, we will have a Governing Council, which will start on the Wednesday, then we will have the General Council on the Thursday morning, and then we will terminate the Governing Council on Thursday afternoon. We make our decisions at the end of the Governing Council meeting, and we will communicate upon completion of the meeting, all the decisions that will have been taken by the Governing Council via our usual channels. It is an optimisation of our organisation. "
2008-05-08,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference here in Athens. I would like to thank Governor Garganas for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation rates have risen significantly since the autumn, owing mainly to increases in energy and food prices. As we have said on previous occasions, inflation rates are expected to remain high for a rather protracted period of time, before gradually declining again. The latest information confirms our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of continuing very vigorous money and credit growth. At the same time, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. However, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions still persist. Against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. The firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest data and survey information on economic activity confirm previous expectations of moderate but ongoing growth in the first half of 2008. In particular, industrial production data for the first months of the year showed resilience, while economic sentiment generally continued to soften. Overall, the euro area economy has sound fundamentals and does not suffer from major imbalances. In line with available forecasts, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real GDP growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. While moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from strong growth in emerging economies. This should continue to support euro area external demand. Meanwhile, investment growth in the euro area should provide ongoing support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation remains solid and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained. At the same time, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. This supports real disposable income and thus consumption growth, although purchasing power is being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices. The uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high, and downside risks prevail. In particular, risks relate to the potential for the financial market turbulence to have a more negative impact on the real economy than previously anticipated. Moreover, downside risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. Risks also arise from protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained above 3% for the past six months. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, it was 3.3% in April 2008. This outturn confirms the ongoing strong short-term upward pressure on inflation, resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, moderating only gradually over the course of 2008. Accordingly, we are currently experiencing a rather protracted period of high annual rates of inflation. In order to ensure that current high inflation rates remain temporary, it is imperative that they do not become entrenched in longer-term expectations or lead to broadly based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. The risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term remain clearly on the upside. These risks include the possibility of further rises in energy and food prices, as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. Most importantly, there is a risk that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures. In particular, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, may prove stronger than currently expected. Moreover, higher than expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation, tight labour market conditions and the risk of second-round effects owing to the high level of current inflation rates. Against this background, it is imperative that all the parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, meet their responsibilities. Wage-setting needs to take into account productivity developments, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, and price competitiveness positions. Moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years. Second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. In the view of the Governing Council, continued responsible wage agreements are of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth remained very vigorous at 10.3% in March, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. At the same time, annual M1 growth continued to moderate in March, reflecting higher short-term interest rates which encouraged further shifts from overnight into time deposits. While the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors suggest that annual M3 growth currently overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion, nonetheless, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. The growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. However, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. While some future moderation can be expected in the light of tightening financing conditions and slower economic growth, bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 15.0% in the year to March 2008, and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong. For the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence seen since early August 2007 has strongly influenced the development of broad money and loans. Continued strong loan growth to non-financial corporations suggests that the availability of bank credit to euro area firms has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and with no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. However, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high. Against this background, we emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Regarding fiscal policies, the latest forecast by the European Commission points to a rise in the euro area general government deficit ratio in 2008, followed by a further small increase in 2009. This deterioration in part reflects a less favourable economic environment and a likely reversal of windfall revenues accrued in past years. However, it also reflects a standstill in fiscal consolidation and new deficit-increasing measures in a number of countries with fiscal imbalances, including some with high deficits. For several countries, the attainment of the country-specific medium-term objectives by 2010 at the latest, which is the commitment made by euro area governments in Berlin in April 2007, is clearly at risk. In these countries, much more ambitious policies are imperative. For all countries, prudent fiscal policies would also help to counteract current inflationary pressures. At the current juncture, it is also important to reinforce the structural reform agenda, in particular with a view to fostering market integration and to reducing rigidities in product and labour markets. Policy initiatives aimed at enhancing competition in market segments with low competition, such as services and energy, would allow pricing behaviour to adjust and thus contribute to lower inflation pressures. Furthermore, policies to increase trend productivity growth would contribute to smaller unit labour cost increases and ultimately also to higher employment. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * And I have a question regarding Greece – can you confirm that you had a meeting today with Bank of Greece employees regarding their problems with the social security fund and the efforts of the government to pass the new resolutions? If yes, what did you discuss and what did you tell them? First of all, let me confirm that, as usual, we examined the situation, which has for a number of months been technically largely multi-dimensional. We were unanimous in taking the decision to maintain interest rates at the present level. As I said on behalf of the Governing Council, and I also said that last time, we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. I have no reason to say that “vigilance” has disappeared from our potential vocabulary. It is an expression which we can certainly utilise when we judge that it is time to utilise it. I would also say that we are in a state of permanent alertness, and all observers know that, at all times, we will do what we judge appropriate in order to be faithful to our mandate, namely to deliver price stability in the medium term and to be credible in that delivery. As regards Greece, at this stage I would only say that the Governing Council has made its position public and sent it to the Greek government. We are expecting a response from the Ministry of Finance at this stage. That is what we said. I have said what I had to say: it is clear that we believe that the present monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will produce and make public the staff projections next month. We will see what our new staff projections are. At this stage all I would say for the present year is that the average growth which is projected by the international institutions – and I could take a number of them, including the OECD – and by the private sector – would be reasonably close to what our own staff published in the last projections. And this is largely due to the fact that the first quarter appears to be resilient, which, whatever the slowing down of growth in the second semester is, could permit us to have an average rate of growth for 2008 which again is very much, in the view of observers, public and private, in line with what we had said previously. But I do not want to anticipate what our staff will present next time. It is work in progress, and a number of new pieces of information are coming. They are mixed, at a global level as well as at the European level. From time to time we have good news in comparison with expectations; from time to time we have less good news, obviously. And it is true for outside the euro area as well as inside the euro area. You have noticed for instance that the services sector PMI was a little bit better than anticipated in April, that the European Commission’s service confidence indicator was a little bit less flattering than anticipated, and that consumer confidence in March was unchanged. Again, we have a number of indications that are coming; we have to take stock of all those indications in the new staff projections. The second question is: can there be real inflation without an accommodative monetary policy on behalf of the central banking authorities? As regards your first question: I don’t see that I have pronounced the word “augured”. In any case we, at the level of the Governing Council, do not underwrite any particular projections, even the staff projections. We are taking stock of all the information available from our own staff, which is a very important input, and from the public and private sector. On your second point: our monetary policy is designed to deliver price stability in the medium term. It is our mandate. It is what the Treaty is calling upon us to do. And it is what the people of Europe are asking us to deliver. All the information we have, including surveys, show to what extent our 320 million fellow citizens are very eager to have price stability in the medium term. And again I have to say that it is important because not only is it our mandate, not only is it what the people of Europe are calling upon us to do, but it is also very important in the present turbulence that we are experiencing in the financial markets. A solid anchoring of inflation expectations permits additional volatility in medium and long-term market interest rates to be avoided. And avoiding such volatility in this component of European finance is important in the present circumstances. Secondly, in terms of the financial crisis we are now more or less three-quarters of a year into the present liquidity crisis, what’s your latest verdict on where we are in this crisis? Do you see any easing of the liquidity situation at all? If one looks at the eurozone money market it doesn’t really seem like it. And thirdly, we are only a few weeks away from an important anniversary, the tenth birthday of the European Central Bank. If you had a birthday wish list, what would be on it for the next ten years? On the last question, the celebration will be a unique occasion to say what has happened over the last ten years and to look at the perspectives. 2 June is a very important date. As regards the first question, inflation rates are expected to remain high for a rather protracted period of time before gradually declining again. On the financial turbulence, this process of market correction of great amplitude, with episodes of high levels of volatility, episodes of very high levels of turbulence and elements of overshooting that we see in a number of markets is an ongoing phenomenon. We are observing elements that are in some respects encouraging and seem to show that a number of markets are going progressively back to normal, or closer to what would be normal functioning, but it is not the case for all the markets concerned. And, in a domain which is important for us, namely the tensions which we are observing in the money market that do not originate in the money market but are reflected in it and originate outside of it, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council a moment ago, we continue to see those persistent tensions. And that is one of the illustrations of this ongoing process that we are observing. A number of decisions have been taken, on both sides of the Atlantic, to cope with these persistent tensions. All market participants and institutions know that we are alert in this domain. This is an ongoing correction and I will not qualify the phenomenon that we have in front of us in any other way. One of the main reasons why we have market tensions in our own money market and interbank money market is that a large number of institutions – and not only banks or financial institutions – are expressing a strong preference for liquidity which is atypical in terms of historical observations, and this preference for liquidity is continuing to influence all the markets. And my other question is: what is your forecast for the euro area? Do you feel that we’ve gone through the main damage in the financial markets or do you think that there is worse to come? For the second question, as I have just said, this is an ongoing process of market correction which is complex. On the economies of the euro area, I would emphasise something I said on behalf of the Governing Council which is important for all economies, including Greece, namely that particular attention should be given to cost competitiveness indicators and to relative competitiveness indicators, particularly in countries or economies where deterioration of the competitive position has been observed over time and where current account deficits of considerable magnitude have also been observed, as you have mentioned, and where we also have a level of employment which is not necessarily satisfactory. These are major criteria: the level of competitiveness, the level of unemployment and the level of the imbalances which stem from the absence of sufficient competitiveness. It is a message for all economies that are members of the euro area that the Governing Council thinks is important to convey. It is also the case here. We were unanimous in our decision to maintain rates as they are. As always, we examined the situation from all angles, but there was no call for anything but the decision that we took. I also understand you would have had the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters on inflation expectations, and I would ask whether they are still showing that inflation expectations are anchored. And then, could I just follow up with another question about foreign exchange markets, and whether you would agree that US and European interests are now closer aligned in favour of a stronger dollar? As regards the bank lending survey, we will publish the latest bank lending survey at 10 a.m. tomorrow. We have had a hint at what is likely to be observed in this survey: a continued increase in the net tightening of credit standards for loans in the first quarter. If my memory serves me correctly, we could have a net tightening of 49% in the first quarter of this year instead of 41% in the last quarter of last year. That is to say, a further increase in the net tightening of credit standards confirming the tendency we have observed during the recent period. Also the net tightening for loans to households for house purchase is increasing, i.e. 33% instead of 21%. This indicates clearly that we have a continuous tightening. As I said, it does not fit well with the fact that we see some of the counterparts of the monetary aggregates continuing to be extraordinarily dynamic, for example outstanding loans to the non-financial corporate sector are growing at a pace of 15%, which is more than last month, when they grew at 14.8%. We are not 100% sure that we have captured all the underlying factors, but it is clear that we have a degree of substitution because a number of non-financial corporates have decided not to issue bonds and paper in general, including commercial paper and shorter-term commercial paper, as they used to do. That might explain the dynamism of the loans. There are also drawings on previous lines of credit, standby credit or confirmed credits. These would be no new credit decisions but old decisions, upon which non-financial corporates are drawing. We might have other explanations. But, if all this is true, we should eventually see not only the end of the continuing acceleration in these outstanding loans to non-financial corporates, but the start of a deceleration. Again, it is work in progress, even if we can identify the underlying phenomena a little more clearly. As regards the exchange rate, you will be aware that we changed the wording during the last meeting at the level of the G7. I signed this communiqué. I was asked myself what it meant and I said that “it speaks for itself”. I also mentioned that I was taking what was said by the US authorities, the President, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, very seriously. Namely, that a strong dollar was in the interest of the United States. I have said this before, and I will say it again. And, if it is considered by a number of observers as being serious and convincing, I would be very happy. And my second question is: the most recent inflation data was a bit milder than the month before. It was 3.3% in the eurozone, and in Germany it was a little bit down as well. What do you make of this decrease? Do you think that this has an implication that your rather protracted area of high inflation will be shortened, or anything else? Do you have anything to make of it? I don’t know why you say that we have a different view of the inflation risk, and inflation as it is materialising, from last time. We are very much in the same mood and we don’t draw particular conclusions from the fact that headline inflation came down from 3.6% to 3.3%. I would say the best description of our attitude as regards this short-term evolution of the CPI would be that we didn’t change our vision today in comparison with the last meeting. We continue to consider that inflation will be high for a protracted period of time, as is seen. Again, I don’t draw a lot of consequences from what we are observing from one month to the other; we have volatility and we have to remain cautious and prudent. It will then gradually decline, and that was our judgement last time as well as this time. I think this answers your two questions. And my second question is for Mr Garganas, since this has been an opportunity for those of us based in Frankfurt to acquaint ourselves with the commanding heights of the Greek economy this week. You are coming up on a transition of your own and I wondered if you could comment on what you would like to see from Greece in the coming years. Of course you and Mr Papademos were large participants in the macroeconomic stabilisation of Greece in the last ten to fifteen years. Of course, now the real fun begins, with all sorts of structural reforms that presumably Greece needs to undertake. I wonder if you could give us some insight into what you would like to see happen when you look back five or ten years from now. I will respond to your first question, and also to Mr Atkins’s question, because I didn’t mention that, as regards the Survey of Professional Forecasters, it will be published on 15 May in our Monthly Bulletin. As you know, we are following inflation expectations through a large number of channels and indicators. We have the Survey of Professional Forecasters, we have a number of private sector analyses, appreciations and judgements, and we have the financial markets. What I see in the area of the Survey of Professional Forecasters is that clearly there is an impact of the level of headline inflation that we are observing today and of the fact that this high level of inflation has been observed in the past, for quite a number of months, under all the influences that we know. But at this stage I would say that the medium-long-term inflation expectations that we can extract from surveys are in line with our mandate and our definition of price stability. But we have to remain constantly alert; it is no time for complacency in any respect. Again, we consider that the anchoring of inflation expectations is absolutely fundamental for us to deliver price stability in the medium term. From the financial markets we have also indications that the volatility of the break-even has been quite substantial when you extract for example the five-year break-even, the ten-year break-even and the five-year in five years’ time. In this respect alertness is important. We have indications that are from time to time contradictory – the break-even goes up, it goes down – but in any case we, even when we withdraw from the break-even the embedded insurance premia, see levels that signal absolutely no room for complacency in any respect. Garganas: I published my Annual Report on 22 April and so my views are clearly expressed there. Nevertheless, because this report is in Greek and I assume that you did not read it, I will give you an outline of what our views are there and my views in particular. I think the challenge for Greece is to maximize the benefits of participation in a monetary union by making further progress along the path of reforms. It is for Greece particularly important to bring down the relatively high inflation rate in order to improve its competitive position. We have persistently had an inflation rate above that of the euro area average since we adopted the euro. And to achieve this objective it is particularly important to continue on a sustainable and credible path of fiscal consolidation and to improve further fiscal performance by reducing further Greece’s high government debt ratio. And of course, and this is another issue on which my views are well known, in this country at any rate, I believe that public finance in this country should have sufficient room for manoeuvre in order to better cope with expected substantial increases in age-related expenditure, because Greece is faced with one of the worst problems of an ageing population, which will have serious consequences for both healthcare and pension system expenditure. And it is important of course both in the public and private sectors to attain moderate labour cost developments. I have been criticised for that because people believe that we suggest a wage freeze or a cut in wages – we do not. We suggest labour moderation; we suggest that labour cost developments should take into account productivity growth, labour market conditions and developments in competitor countries. This is a standard position of the Governing Council, if I may say so Mr President, and of the Bank of Greece all these years. Attention must also focus on other coming structural constraints on economic growth and job creation. There is an issue of fostering labour force participation and the strengthening of competition in product markets. Product markets are not functioning properly in Greece in many sectors, and this will help keep profit margins consistent with price stability. And an improvement in the functioning of labour markets is also very important, particularly in Greece. And a question to Mr Papademos, are there any persuasive steps that you believe national governments could take to cushion the blow of higher inflation without making your job more difficult? Let me say again that, as far as the Governing Council is concerned, what I said today on behalf of the Governing Council was that it is imperative that all the parties concerned in both the private and public sectors meet their responsibilities. Wage-setting needs to take into account productivity developments, the continued high level of unemployment in many economies, and price competitiveness positions. We are also saying that moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years. That is a very strong message that we are sending to all countries, and of course those recommendations apply more to some than to others, because we are mentioning a number of specific criteria, including these price competitiveness indicators. As regards your implicit question on whether it is appropriate to offset some price increases in oil, in commodities or in other areas by means of operations that will artificially lower some other elements, I would say that no, it’s not the position that we would take. Of course, we advise all parties, including governments, not to create additional problems by increasing indirect taxation or increasing administrative prices, but we are not calling for exceptional offsetting of some of the price increases because in most cases this corresponds to a real transfer, and we have to accept that. You will remember that those who tried, in the first oil shock in 1973 and 1974, to cancel out the impact of the oil shock in their own economies did very poorly afterwards. We can make a clear distinction between those economies which recognised that prices had changed – and that had to be recognised and accepted – and those who thought that they could protect their economies from the real transfer: the second had very poor results in comparison with the first. And the second oil shocks tell exactly the same story. The mass unemployment in Europe started with the inappropriate response of several economies to the first and second oil shock. That is something which has been very well documented. But there was a question for Lucas. Papademos: I should first say that there have been a number of positive developments over the past few years. Greece has experienced robust economic growth and has made further progress towards fiscal consolidation and structural adjustment. On the negative side, the weak feature of the Greek economy has been the low degree of competitiveness, as measured by a variety of indicators. And the persistence of significant divergences in unit labour cost increases over a number of years has had adverse implications for the inflation increase, as well as for the country’s competitiveness position. The cumulative loss of competitiveness over several years is reflected in the widening of the current account deficit, which has reached very high levels as a percentage of GDP and may not be sustainable. So far, the negative impact on economic activity from the growing external imbalances has been partly or fully offset by the positive influence of various domestic factors that have stimulated economic activity. But the influence of these factors may decline over time, and were this to happen, the adverse effects of the external imbalances on activity and employment would be felt more. So what is important – and what I’m saying is very much in line with what was said earlier on by President Trichet and Governor Garganas – is the pursuit of policies that will strengthen competitiveness, which, as you suggested, first of all involves further structural reforms in order to foster higher productivity growth and strengthen competition in markets. Moderate labour cost increases are also necessary and are particularly important in helping to restore competitiveness over time. A combination of policies in labour and product markets, in order to strengthen competition, foster productivity growth and ensure wage moderation should be pursued so as to increase competitiveness. I think this is the path to take in the years to come. We have never been alarmed. We have a Treaty: the Treaty says that we are independent. The Treaty says that we cannot receive instructions, and we cannot even ask for instructions. The Treaty says that no entity, including governments, can even try to influence the ECB, its President, its Vice-President, the members of the Governing Council, the members of the Executive Board. This is clear, and if you look at the market participants, observers, investors, savers the world over, they have absolutely no doubt that we are independent. And that we are fiercely attached to respecting the will of the European democracies, because we did not invent our own independence! We were given a mandate and we were given independence by the European democracies; very solemnly and in a way which has been exemplary in terms of democratic decision-making. Not to mention that the 320 million fellow citizens are extremely attached to us doing our job; the last survey that we carried out – and I already said this publicly – showed that 78% of our fellow citizens answered yes to the question: “Do you consider it important that the ECB is independent from governments in order to deliver price stability?”. And also, the second question is, if higher energy and food costs persist for longer than anticipated, would it be effective for the ECB to tighten policy to target inflation, which is being generated by prices beyond its control? I already responded to those questions, and have nothing to add that would give a different view. We are very clear on what is our mandate, the fact that we believe that the present monetary policy stance will permit us to achieve our objective and, that being said, we are constantly alert, as everybody will understand. As I said, what we see is that our fellow citizens are not happy with the present level of CPI or headline inflation – understandably so – and that they consider price stability to be of extreme importance. They decided to give us that mandate. That mandate was given to the Governing Council of the ECB by the European democracies. All the surveys we have in the 15 countries of the euro area show that citizens are calling for price stability. So we are faithful to our mandate. We might see a number of judgements on what we are doing here and there. Perhaps, some people are simultaneously asking for more price stability and a more accommodative monetary policy, because they are not called on to be coherent necessarily. But, of course, we in the ECB are called on to be coherent. We trust that the decision we took today will permit us to achieve our objective of price stability in the medium term. I have already responded to this question in the past. Of course, this is totally excluded, because I have explained the extent to which the solid anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence in order for us to live up to our mandate and to what the people of Europe are asking us to do. If we were to follow the line you are implicitly suggesting, we would ourselves unanchor all inflation expectations. I invite you to do the following thought experiment: say we followed this advice and announced another figure for the definition of price stability: immediately, all inflation expectations would be unanchored. Then there would be, on top of the arithmetic augmentation of inflation expectations, additional risk premia: market participants would think that if one changes the definition of price stability once, one could change it again, so there would be no protection against future changes. The addition of the change of definition of price stability and the risk premia would immediately trigger a significant augmentation of medium and long-term market interest rates. So it is certainly not something we can envisage for one second. "
2008-04-10,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The latest information has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation. In fact, we are experiencing a rather protracted period of temporarily high annual rates of inflation, resulting mainly from increases in energy and food prices. The latest information also clearly confirms our assessment of prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of continuing very vigorous money and credit growth. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. Incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. However, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions may last longer than initially expected. Against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. The firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council and there is certainly no room for complacency in this regard. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat’s second estimate, quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 0.4%, following 0.7% in the previous quarter. The latest information on economic activity also underpins previous expectations of moderate but ongoing growth in the first quarter of 2008. Overall, the euro area economy has sound fundamentals and does not suffer from major imbalances. Looking ahead, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real GDP growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. While moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from strong growth in emerging economies. This should continue to support euro area external demand. Meanwhile, investment growth in the euro area should provide ongoing support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation is high, profitability has been sustained and there are no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans. At the same time, as a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. While being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices on purchasing power, consumption growth should continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with real disposable income growth. The uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high, and downside risks prevail. The risks relate mainly to the financial market turbulence, which could last longer than initially thought and could have a broader than currently expected impact on the real economy. Moreover, downside risks also stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices, as well as from protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate was 3.5% in March 2008, after 3.3% in February. This outturn confirms the ongoing strong and lately further increasing short-term upward pressure on inflation, resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices in recent months. Looking ahead, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, moderating only gradually over the course of 2008. Accordingly, we are currently experiencing a rather protracted period of temporarily high annual rates of inflation. The risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term remain clearly on the upside. These risks include the possibility of further rises in energy and food prices, as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. Most importantly, there is a risk that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures. In particular, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, may prove stronger than currently expected, and stronger than expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions. Against this background, it is imperative that all the parties concerned meet their responsibilities. Second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on wage and price-setting behaviour must be avoided. In the view of the Governing Council, this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth remained very vigorous at 11.3% in February, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. While annual M1 growth has moderated further in recent months, as higher short-term interest rates have increased the opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of M3, the growth of time deposits remains extremely strong. This reflects the relatively flat yield curve, which has made it more attractive to hold monetary assets remunerated at close to market rates than to hold riskier, longer-maturity instruments. Overall, the impact of the flat yield curve and a number of other temporary factors suggest that annual M3 growth currently overstates the pace of the underlying monetary expansion. However, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. The growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. However, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. Bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.8% in the year to February 2008. Overall, bank loans to the domestic private sector have grown at around 11% on an annual basis for the past two years. For the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence seen since early August 2007 has strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. Notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area, continued strong loan growth to non-financial corporations suggests that the supply of bank credit to firms in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and with no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans to households and non-financial corporations. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. Incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. However, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions may last longer than initially expected. Against this background, we emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Regarding fiscal policies, the intentions reflected in the latest round of stability programmes imply a rise in the euro area general government deficit ratio in 2008. Further fiscal pressures are likely to arise as overly optimistic macroeconomic assumptions are already being revised downwards and political demands for fiscal loosening are increasing. In this situation, countries with fiscal imbalances are urged to make further progress with structural consolidation, in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. At the current juncture, particularly prudent and stability-oriented fiscal policies would also contribute to containing inflationary pressures. Turning to structural reforms, we welcome the launch of the 2008-10 cycle of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs by the European Council. The favourable labour market trends in the euro area suggest that economic reforms are paying off. However, many challenges remain as overall employment is still below the Lisbon target of 70% and unemployment is still unacceptably high. Moreover, productivity growth remains weak, constraining general income growth. Therefore, we strongly encourage euro area countries to increase reform efforts, in particular to foster market integration and to reduce rigidities in product and labour markets that restrict competition, employment flexibility and wage differentiation, and we support them in these efforts. They would not only promote employment and support potential growth, but would also contribute to moderating price pressures. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * With regard to the financial turbulence, you know that we have always said that it was a very significant market correction, with episodes of turbulence and a very high level of volatility, and that it was ongoing. From the very beginning, our judgement was that it was very serious and that it was an ongoing process – remember that we were the first in the world to take very bold decisions to cope with what we considered to be a very serious market correction. As regards our recent decisions, you mentioned that the Governing Council of the ECB had decided to embark on a six-month refinancing operation and that it had been oversubscribed. That is true, and it meant that there was high demand for this kind of refinancing. And we are looking at it very carefully. We will continue to do what we judge to be appropriate, utilising the instruments that have been at our disposal since the very beginning of the ECB. It is the mark of the ECB that we have had the appropriate instruments right from the beginning of the turbulent episode that we are presently observing, unlike other central banks. We will continue to look at it carefully. I don’t want to suggest that we will take any new decisions at this stage. On your question regarding second-round effects, you know that, for us, it is key to live up to our mandate: we have to deliver price stability in the medium term, in line with our definition, and to continue to solidly anchor inflationary expectations. This is essential, first, to deliver price stability, second, to permit the financial markets and the money markets to incorporate a low level of inflation in the various medium and long-term market interest rates. In that way, we are contributing in an appropriate manner to calming down the financial markets. I insist on that point: by solidly anchoring inflation expectations, we are making a major contribution to financial stability, and to the orderly functioning of markets. As regards price settings and wages you know that we have always recommended moderation. This recommendation was for all countries and all social partners in the euro area. At this stage, first, we will reinforce our call for social partners to be responsible. The second-round effects that we observed in the first and second oil shocks created mass unemployment in Europe. Before the second-round effects following the first oil shock, there was no mass unemployment in Europe – all economies were close to full employment, or at full employment. So, it is very serious. It is very serious for us to deliver price stability and for protecting against inflation all economic agents, households, in particular the most vulnerable and the poorest of our fellow citizens, because they cannot protect themselves against inflation. It is also extremely important for job creation, and for preserving the first success of the euro since its creation, namely a very dynamic job creation. Once more, we are making a very strong call on all social partners in Europe. On your first question: As you know, I never comment, on the day to day evolution of markets in general, and much less so in real time at this very moment! That would be very strange. I would only say that the sentiment of the Governing Council is today the same as in our last meeting. So if there is any interpretation that it goes in another direction, it would be a wrong interpretation. On your second point, we were unanimous in taking that decision after due meditation and discussion of the situation,. As was the case during the last meetings of the Governing Council, it was obviously very complex, multi-dimensional discussion. After weighing up all the elements of the situation, we were unanimous in maintaining rates at 4%. On your first question, the bank lending survey undoubtedly indicates that banks are tightening their credit standards, and we have no reason to call that into question. It is clearly what it is telling us. On the other hand, as you have mentioned, we see very dynamic growth continuing in outstanding loans, in particular, as I mentioned in the introductory statement, as regards non-financial corporations, where the figure jumped to 14.8%. This is a magnitude of three times GDP in value terms for these particular outstanding loans. And it is more than last time. The turbulence started in August last year and we still see this continued dynamism. We do not think that it comes from a repatriation of instruments that were off-balance-sheet and are coming onto the balance sheet. Our staff who are analysing the situation do not see evidence of that. It might come from the fact that a number of firms want to be as liquid as possible and so are drawing from their credit lines, standby credit, confirmed credit. That can be understood in the present circumstances. It could also be that they are embarking less on issuing instruments like bonds and commercial papers and have less access to stock issuance, and prefer to draw from banking loans. So there is probably a certain degree of substitution. But what we have in front of us and what we have to take into account as an important counterpart of the monetary aggregates is this dynamic outstanding loan to the corporate sector I mentioned. As I said, we continue to do a lot of work to understand better what the underlying factors are that explain this phenomenon. We do not observe this phenomenon with regard to households. There is a continuing slowdown of the growth of households’ outstanding loans, and also a continuing diminishing of credit for housing. As regards the exchange markets, you asked the theoretical question of the pass-through and of what happens in the domestic economy when you have moves in the exchange rates. It is a very interesting question. It is true that it looks to be very much less acute and significant in comparison with what we observed perhaps twenty years ago, or even perhaps ten years ago. This is a matter for reflection and meditation, but as you suggested, I am not particularly eloquent on the exchange rates. And I will remain disciplined, because in this domain verbal discipline is absolutely of the essence. On the accord that we have with the Federal Reserve and that other central banks also have with the Federal Reserve, as you know we have this accord on an ongoing basis. So we will judge the situation, and if we judge at any time that there is no new need for that accord to function, we will interrupt it. But at this stage I would say we certainly do not see that to be obvious, so we will continue to participate in this agreement at this stage. On the coordinated action of central banks, of course this swap agreement with the Federal Reserve is a good example of such coordinated action. We started this action, as you remember, last year. So it’s an ongoing process. In a way there has been another sort of coordinated action because when I look at what has been done by other sister central banks, I see that they have very much improved their own set of tools and instruments in order to be as able as we have been since the very beginning to cope with the unexpected tensions and unexpected challenges that we all have had to cope with. I really believe that as regards the functioning of the money market it’s very important that the central banks remain in close contact, as they are. It’s obvious when you look at certain indicators that there is some kind of arbitrage, over the Atlantic, for instance. As regards the three-month interbank money market and the overnight swap interest rates in three months’ time, we have exactly the same kind of spreads, and that says something about the kind of challenges we all have to cope with. Let me mention again that as far as we are concerned, we make a clear distinction as regards what we need to do to deliver price stability and be credible in the delivery of price stability on the one hand and our responsibility as regards the smooth functioning of the money market on the other hand. We have made that distinction since the very beginning, since the first day, we have taken seriously the challenge that we have had to cope with. We have been bold and I would say with the benefit of hindsight everybody recognises that our analysis was lucid. But since the first day we have also said that we have our monetary policy stance, which is designed to deliver price stability, and once the interest rate is decided then we implement our monetary policy with a view to maintaining the very short-term interest rates at the level of our decision whatever the tensions are, whatever the challenges are. As regards your last point I have said often that we are, on the two sides of the Atlantic, facing different economies, different economic structures, different levels of flexibility of the economies, and different shocks. I have said that we are also facing different imbalances and, to be clear, we are not imbalanced as regards investment and savings on this side of the Atlantic, while there is obviously a big difference between savings and investment on the other side of Atlantic. So all this makes the two economies, the various shocks they have to cope with, and the reaction to shocks in the two economies different, and that’s the reason why, again, as regards the ECB’s Governing Council, we have our own response to the present situation. I think we should not overestimate the difference that exists between our own response to what we have in front of us and what the US Fed has in front of it. What counts for us – it’s clear – is that we have a mandate, we have one needle in our compass, we do not have two needles in our compass. We have to deliver price stability, and we believe – not only in Europe but in a large part of the world – that by delivering price stability and being credible in the delivery of price stability we not only deliver price stability but also create the conditions for job creation, for sustainable growth and, particularly in this period of turbulence, also to calm down the financial markets by solidly anchoring the inflationary expectations that are embedded in medium and long-term market interest rates. And let me again mention the fact that, with this mandate for the central bank, we created 15.7 million jobs in the euro area from 1 January 1999, the start of the euro, up to the end of 2007. 15.7 million jobs, which is more than three times as many as during the equivalent period of nine years before the euro was introduced and more than in the United States. This is not necessarily very well known but is the reality of the figures and of the facts. On your first point, we do not envisage at all the solution that you have been mentioning, and, as far as we are concerned, we consider that we have in our framework all the instruments that are necessary. As I said, we did not invent any new instruments, we did not enlarge the eligibility of the collateral of our own refinancing operations and, at this stage, I would say that we are reasonably satisfied with the present framework. Of course, I do not exclude any further decision that we could take when the time comes: we will follow the situation cautiously, but at this stage, there are absolutely no such intentions. As regards the bank lending survey, we have no anticipation of what we could see in the future. I would say that I only fully confirm what I have already said. It seems to me very normal, in the present situation that the banks are more cautious, more attentive, they look at the credit risk with great caution and, so, I am not surprised at all by the response that we are receiving from the banks. And, again, still we have this level of growth of outstanding loans, which is very important. And we have to take this as a given, as these are the figures that we have in front of us. I gave you one explanation, perhaps we have other explanations. It relies very much, to my understanding, on the fact that demand from the corporate sector is strong. No. As regards your point on the exchange rate, let me say again – because I would not like you to interpret my silence on the exchange rate – that I deplore the excessive volatility of exchange rates. I was concerned by the recent excessive moves, and, as I have already said – but it is even truer, certainly at the moment – I have observed with great attention and interest what has been said by the US authorities, including the highest authority, which is the President of the United States, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury and my colleague Ben Bernanke. On the UK, I would only say that excessive volatility is not welcome for any of us and I guess that it is not welcome for the United Kingdom, as it is not welcome for us. It is a good question. As you know, what we do ourselves is we publish projections of our own staff. And those projections incorporate a large element of range, because we consider that we are in a universe which remains uncertain. Nobody is, of course, the master of the price of oil, or the master of the price of commodities, or the masters of the price of agro-food products. We are the master of other prices: Economic agents, price-setters are the masters of domestic prices. Governments are the masters of a lot of prices: administrative prices, indirect taxation – which has a direct impact on inflation; they are also the masters, as social partners in their turn, of the wages and salaries in the public sector and the civil service. So, we have a lot of prices that we fix, but others that we do not. And the protracted period of high inflation which we are in, is, as I said, due very much to those phenomena of oil, energy, commodities – let us not forget commodities other than oil, because we have also had very protracted prices increases in this domain – and food. The projection of our staff for 2009 is that HICP would be between 1.5% and 2.7%. And if we were to restart this exercise at the level of staff at the moment, the figures would not probably be exactly the same, because a number of factors would have to be taken into account: parameters would have changed in a number of directions. Again, it is a very multi-dimensional exercise – you have a number of parameters that have changed: the price of oil, the price of commodities, the exchange rate, etc. But all that being said, within the horizon of 18 months, which is the horizon for decisions that we take today – today, for instance, we took the decision to maintain interest rates at 4% when some, as you know, are publicly calling on us to decrease rates – we will, we think, we trust, that we would deliver price stability in line with our definition after this lag of, say, 18 months. That being said, I remain cautious and prudent. We remain alert – permanently – and it is in this perspective that I said that we had a protracted, but temporary period of very high inflation. We remain permanently alert because all depends on our own credibility and on the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations, because the price-setters today take into account what they expect to be inflation in the medium run after this hump has progressively disappeared. We are, at the level of the 320 million people of the euro area, in exactly the same situation as the Federal Reserve is with 300 million people or more. We both look at the economy as a whole. We have a single economy with a single currency and we have differences. You mentioned a number of countries: Ireland is certainly a country which is not necessarily at the average of the euro area, just as California, Florida or Alaska are not necessarily at the average of the US. When we take a snapshot of the situation today in the US, state by state, and in the euro area, country by country, I would say that we have approximately the same standard deviation of inflation and of rate of growth. This is what our own research, which has been published and confirmed, has shown. So you have to take this into account. The Governing Council looks at the continent as a whole, from Helsinki to Lisbon, from Nicosia to Dublin, from Malta to Ljubljana – these are the geographic dimensions of the continent which is a single economy with a single currency. First of all, let me take advantage of your question to repeat how much I have appreciated Toshihiko Fukui. He was a very impressive governor of the Bank of Japan, and a very wise participant in all our meetings at the level of the G7, at the level of the G10, and at the level of the global economy meeting in Basel. And I have already had the opportunity to say how we had all appreciated enormously his contribution. I know Mr Shirakawa. I have been in touch with him. In his previous position, he had been in touch with a lot of important persons in all central banks, including here in the ECB where he has a lot of friends. So I am expecting that we will have a very close relationship with him and with Bank of Japan as we had in the past. And this is very important because the “brotherhood” of central bankers is certainly going to remain, particularly through a period of very difficult challenges and very demanding circumstances, of the utmost importance. We have a level of confidence between us which is priceless. This is true across the Atlantic, across the Channel, across the Pacific, and with all the central bank governors of the emerging countries that are also playing an important role in the present circumstances, particularly because their own economies are providing a persistent dynamism in the global economy which is very important at the present time. Of course, all experiences are welcome. We live in a world where wisdom based on experience, the accumulation of experiences is probably more important than ever. Those who have lived through great difficulty have discovered things, just as when you x-ray an object or a body you see things that you do not see in normal times. So having the chance to have lived in very demanding times and to have observed exceptional circumstances is important. On the first question, taking into account the diagnosis that we made even before the start of the turbulent episode it was clear that an important market correction was both unavoidable and necessary because we had, before the turbulent episode, an under-pricing of risks in general in global finance that was documented. This diagnosis was shared with other central bankers. When we discussed it in Basel at the end of 2006, we were thinking that a market correction was unavoidable and necessary. So, I am no more and no less worried than I have been since the start of the turbulent episode. What is clear is that it takes time for this market correction to proceed. But I think it would be wrong to say “it is a total catastrophe, it has been going on for a much too long period of time” because a lot of work has been done in the private sector – a lot of corrections have taken place. The private sector has certainly learned a lot and taken a lot of decisions that are going in a better direction, namely paving the way for a more sustainable pace in global finance and the global economy. But it is also equally important to be pretty conscious that we might also have in front of us very difficult challenges, and we have to be alert. We have to be permanently alert. It is no time to be complacent in any domain – that is absolutely clear. As regards Sweden, Sweden is welcome in the euro area. Sweden is a country which has no opting-out clause, so as soon as Sweden meets the Maastricht criteria, Sweden is committed to joining the euro area. The euro area is now a little bit different from when we started: stricto sensu we started with 11 countries – we are now 15. We are now 320 million, and I already mentioned the geographic dimension of this vast economy with a single currency. So again, Sweden is indeed very welcome. First of all, this is very much the reflection of the perception of the market itself. One measure of the market perception was that, before the end of last year, the measure of tensions that I mentioned – the three-month interbank money market in comparison with the overnight interest swaps – had a hump on three months and was lower before three months – say one month, two months – and lower after three months – six months, one year. So you had a hump at these months. After the end of last year, we could see that the hump had disappeared. There was an increase in the spread up to three months and then it remained at an elevated level. That is a reflection of the fact that the market itself, in its own functioning – at least if you consider that this is a pertinent indicator – was thinking that it was not only a short-term episode but, perhaps, a longer-term episode – an ongoing process which would take more time. This is one of the readings of what we see. But since the very beginning we didn’t believe that it would be an episode that would not last – we said it’s an “ongoing process”. And I never said, myself, we are guessing and hoping that within two months, or three months, or six months, tensions will evaporate. I never said that because we did not believe that. We will see. I said that not all economies are alike. We see a number of factors operating on the other side of the Atlantic which we do not see here. As I mentioned in the Introductory Statement, uncertainty is there. We know that we are living in a world which is uncertain. We have to remain alert. We have the immense luck to have a compass, and that is important of course. And we know that by sticking to what our compass indicates, we not only do our job and are faithful to our mandate, but we are also contributing to calming the tensions and contributing to sustainable growth and job creation. That’s our mindset at the moment I’m speaking. "
2008-03-06,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Mr Bajuk, President of the ECOFIN Council, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The latest information has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation. It has also confirmed the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. Incoming macroeconomic data point to moderating but ongoing real GDP growth. Yet the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high. Against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. Indeed, the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest information on economic activity confirms the picture of moderating growth around the turn of the year. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of euro area real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 0.4%, following 0.8% in the previous quarter. Surveys of business and consumer confidence, which have followed a downward trend since the summer of 2007, overall remain consistent with ongoing growth. Looking ahead, in 2008 both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real GDP growth in the euro area, albeit at lower rates than during 2007. The fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound and the euro area economy does not suffer from major imbalances. While being dampened by the global slowdown, investment growth should provide ongoing support, as capacity utilisation is high and profitability has been sustained. At the same time, as a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. While being dampened by higher commodity prices, consumption growth should continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with rising employment. These factors are also reflected in the March 2008 ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Annual real GDP growth is projected to lie in the range of 1.3% to 2.1% in 2008, and to be between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2009. In comparison with the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards, reflecting weaker global demand, stronger pressure from commodity prices and less favourable financing conditions than were foreseen in December. Available forecasts from international organisations broadly confirm this outlook. In the view of the Governing Council, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains unusually high. Downside risks to the outlook for economic activity continue to exist. They relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments. Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional commodity price rises, protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat’s first estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate was 3.2% in February 2008, unchanged from January. This confirms the strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term, stemming mainly from the increases in energy and food prices in recent months. Looking ahead, we expect a more protracted period of relatively high rates of inflation than we did a few months ago. The annual HICP inflation rate will most likely remain significantly above 2% in the coming months and moderate only gradually later in the year. The March 2008 ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual HICP inflation of between 2.6% and 3.2% in 2008, and between 1.5% and 2.7% in 2009. Compared with the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projected ranges for HICP inflation have shifted upwards, mainly reflecting significant additional increases in food and energy prices. It is important to recall that these staff projections are based on a number of assumptions which are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. In particular, the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates are taken from market expectations as at mid-February. Moreover, it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumptions that the recent dynamism in commodity prices will diminish over the projection horizon, in line with futures prices, and that pressure from labour costs and profit margins will be limited. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term are on the upside. These risks include further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months. Furthermore, they include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions. Moreover, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, could be stronger than expected. Increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far also pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. At this juncture, it is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on price-setting, on the one hand, and on wages, on the other hand, stemming from current inflation rates be avoided. In the view of the Governing Council, this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth remained very vigorous at 11.5% in January, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. A number of temporary factors suggest that M3 growth currently overstates the pace of the underlying monetary expansion. The relatively flat yield curve in particular has made holding monetary assets more attractive. However, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. The growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. However, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. Bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.6% in the year to January 2008. Overall, bank loans to the domestic private sector have grown at around 11% on an annual basis for the past two years. For the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August 2007 strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates up to January 2008. In addition, according to the available data, the turmoil has not led to substantial portfolio shifts into monetary assets, as were observed between 2001 and 2003. Notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area, continued strong loan growth to non-financial corporations suggests that the supply of bank credit to firms in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. Incoming macroeconomic data point to moderating but ongoing real GDP growth. Yet the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high. We emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the fact that the Berlin Eurogroup agreement of April 2007, including the consolidation targets, was confirmed in the ECOFIN Council’s opinions on the latest stability programme updates. There is no justification for delaying structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining fiscal imbalances. On the contrary, the challenges ahead call for particularly prudent and stability-oriented fiscal policies to support private sector confidence. Achieving and maintaining sound fiscal positions will also allow the free operation of automatic stabilisers and contribute to the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union. Structural reforms would not only be beneficial for employment and potential growth, but would also help to reduce inflationary pressures. Enhancing competition, especially in services and network industries, is essential at this juncture to support price stability and enhance productivity growth. Similarly, administered prices, indirect taxes, minimum wage legislation and public sector wage-setting should not add to inflationary pressures in the economy. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * My second question is: how worried are you about the euro’s recent very rapid appreciation? And also, would you still regard your monetary policy stance as neutral? On the first question, I would say that the words I used on behalf of the Governing Council speak for themselves. We were unanimous in deciding to leave interest rates unchanged. We restated that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective. This is our mandate. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations is, as I have said, of the highest priority for the Governing Council. We trust that this solid anchoring allows us to deliver price stability in the medium term, as well as making a major contribution to sustainable growth and job creation. We believe that the current monetary pol icy stance will contribute to the achievement of this objective. I would also say that we are not underwriting the present future market interest rates. We never do that. Let me restate our constant position in this respect: first, we never pre-commit in the medium term, and that is a fundamental feature of our handling of monetary policy; and second, we always decide whatever is necessary, in line with our mandate, to deliver price stability in the medium term. As regards your second question on the exchange markets, I would say again what I have said recently: I note with extreme attention the statements repeated on the other side of the Atlantic by the public authorities, including the President and the Secretary of the Treasury, that a strong US dollar is in the interests of the United States. On your last point, I said already that we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to the achievement of our objective. And second, have you considered providing more dollar liquidity? Are the market problems which made it necessary to do that last year still there? On the first question: I always say when we publish the staff forecasts that these are the staff projections. They are made under the responsibility of the staff, with a methodology that you know, and we at the level of the Governing Council do not underwrite the staff projections. They are an important element that we consider together with all the other informations that we have, including from international institutions and the private sector. As regards your second question, as you will remember, we agreed with colleagues in the United States – together with the Swiss National Bank, in a framework that also included the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and a number of other central banks – that we would provide dollar liquidity in December last year and in January this year. We said that we would not necessarily do so every month. If need be, we could certainly continue with such cooperation, but at the moment I have nothing else to say on that. Second, you made it very clear that you want us to take the expectations embedded in the staff forecasts for interest rates as a technical reality, but you stress that in terms of inflation. Would you also stress that in terms of the growth forecasts? Finally, I wonder if you could tell us what you think is behind the resurgent credit tensions in Europe at the moment and whether you don’t ultimately expect that this will come through and start affecting the supply of credit to households and non-financial corporations, notwithstanding the contradiction you discussed between the bank lending survey and the money data. In answer to your first question, we were unanimous. Of course we always discuss the situation, which is particularly multi-dimensional in the present international and European circumstances. There was no call for either a decrease or increase in rates. We were unanimous. And again, we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective of medium-term price stability and solidly anchoring inflation expectations. As regards the ECB staff projections, I have already said that it was the staff projections and not the projections of the Governing Council. These projections are based on an assumption which is of technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. That assumption is considered by a number of other institutions and our own staff to be appropriate, but we do not endorse that ourselves. As regards the other assumptions you know that they are based on assumptions related to the price of oil, the price of food and of other commodities. As part of the present methodology, they take the indications given by the future market when they exist. Concerning the impact of the turbulence, I will say again that we are living in a multi-dimensional world. What I have noted on behalf of the Governing Council is the dynamism in the outstanding credit growth that we continue to observe, particularly in the field of non-financial corporations. In our last publication of monetary developments the growth of the non-financial corporate credit outstanding was 14.6%, which represents very dynamic growth. This process has still to be fully explained and it is necessary to disentangle all the various influences that are at stake. On the other hand, it is clear that outstanding credits to households are progressively decelerating in line with the previous series of increases in interest rates that we embarked on, which is in line with what should be expected. Second, you’ve repeated several times today this statement ‘we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective, the objective of anchoring inflationary expectations.’ Forgive me for not quite understanding the purpose of inserting that statement this time, but is that another way of saying that given this short-term rise in inflation, what you describe as a short-term rise in inflation, that a monetary policy stance that perhaps tends towards being restrictive might be appropriate. Is that the way we might interpret that statement? A final third question, also on interpreting what you said today, just going back to the assumptions on interest rates, you make the point that these were taken from market expectations as of mid-February. Can I read that sentence as saying that actually what the markets were assuming at that point was tending towards wishful thinking? As regards the exchange market, I said that I noted with great attention what had been said on the other side of the Atlantic. You can deduce from that what you believe would be the right understanding from your standpoint. I am certainly sticking to what we agreed upon at a global level, at the level of the G7 in particular, i.e., that excessive movements, excessive volatility are undesirable for global growth. Answering your second question the sentence speaks for itself as regards the fact that we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. Regarding interest rates, I have already said that we do not underwrite the present future market interest rates, that we never underwrite medium-term future interest rates. It is a fundamental part of our handling of monetary policy in the medium term. And again, we never pre-commit, but always do what we judge necessary to deliver price stability, and be credible in that delivery, in the medium term. They are not our forecasts. As I have said, we always do what is necessary to deliver price stability and be credible in the delivery of price stability, and everybody knows that it is our position. As regards the present monetary policy stance we believe that it will contribute to achieving this objective. Second, to what extent do you believe that the frozen US credit markets are at risk of spreading to Europe in a similar fashion to the way that the turmoil broke out in August? On the first point, we have one needle in our compass, as I have said often enough, although I need to repeat it, because I see that there is a tendency to consider that we are in a two-needle universe. This is not the case. We have one needle in our compass, which is price stability. I have already said that price stability is also a prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation, so that also has to be fully understood. I would say that this is the position of the very large consensus of economists. Slower growth has an impact, because it diminishes the inflationary pressure. To what extent, how, and through which channel is something which has to be fully understood, as well as all other parameters. We have a lot of parameters, and those together concur to influence inflation and price stability – instability – and that is, again, the needle of our compass. That is my response to your first question. As for your second question, we are in a very largely interdependent world, so anything that happens in Europe has an influence on the United States and everything that happens in the United States has an influence on Europe. It is a relationship which is not necessarily asymmetric – we are all influencing one another. So, if any good or bad evolutions come from the United States, they have an influence on the rest of the world, as we are all in one universe, we are all interdependent. That being said, we have our own economies – they are not the same; our own shocks – they are not the same; our own flexibility – they are not necessarily the same on all continents and certainly not necessarily the same on both sides of the Atlantic. If you consider the various central banks some are moving, others are not, some are moving down, and others are moving up. In a way, we are all in close relation, because I trust that we all are doing what we judge, in the best of our analysis, in order to continue to solidly anchor inflationary expectations. But the reasoning, for example in Australia cannot be exactly the same as in Canada, here or in the United States, or in the United Kingdom. In that sense we are in a different universe. We have to judge, based on our own mandate, what is appropriate in the various economies in which we exert our responsibilities. We have no particular theory on that. We are certainly living in a universe where the weakness of some currencies can be associated with the weakness of domestic features, but I will not comment on particular currencies. With regard to commodities, there are various ways to look at it. They are not the same. Oil is perhaps of a different nature. However, there is no doubt that we can see the effect of supply and demand and the encountering of supply and demand, as well as the effect of fairly high levels of cartelisation in the various markets. Let me only make a general remark: if it is confirmed that the global economy is slowing down, it would be a normal feature of the global economy that a number of commodity prices, including oil, would be pushed up less or would go down. This would be a normal feature of the functioning of the global economy and would form part of the automatic stabilisation at the global level. I make this remark as an economist. There is absolutely no doubt that we must be faithful to our mandate, and our mandate is clear. Moreover, if I had to interpret our mandate from the perspective of the people – our 320 million fellow citizens in Europe – they would tell us: be faithful to your mandate. That is very clear. So, we are in a situation which is, as always, multi-dimensional, but which is perhaps unusually multi-dimensional. We must continue to be scrupulously faithful to our mandate and sure that by being credible in delivering price stability, we continue to solidly anchor inflationary expectations. There is no contradiction between price stability and growth and job creation – on the contrary. If inflationary expectations were unanchored, what would happen? All medium and long-term market interest rates would increase, rather than diminish because these higher levels of expected inflation would be incorporated in the medium and long-term interest rates. This demonstrates once again that we have two elements that we should never forget: when we are faithful to our mandate, we are paving the way for sustainable job creation. Secondly, does the present level of the euro reflect economic fundamentals? And this sentence that we all keep coming back to: “We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective”. Does that mean that the monetary policy stance is equally likely to be restrictive or accommodative in future as circumstances warrant? I have already responded to the third question so I will not comment further. We will do what is necessary to deliver price stability. On the first question, I said it was an economist’s remark. When we have a buoying global economy, we see the prices of commodities accelerating. This was easily explainable by the fact that demand was getting stronger and stronger. If – and I repeat if – there is a slowing down of growth in the global economy, we should see a symmetrical evolution, namely a deceleration of those prices. But I have already mentioned that we have a number of cartels that could explain why these evolutions may not be as symmetrical. On your second question: I have already said all I have to say on the euro. And I have another question: As credit markets are tightening again and you may have to intervene again, how closely are you monitoring the creditworthiness of the asset-backed bonds you are accepting as collateral because you know there have been some questions marks over some of the collateral that you have been accepting. On the first question: observers and economists – the mainstream of the analysis – consider that what we have done in the past was right. Prices were countered by a succession of shocks, but that did not hamper the credibility of our medium-term delivery of price stability. That is clearly the way we are perceived. We have observed a succession of shocks in this period, particularly in the domain of oil and commodities. The latest shock we have to cope with is a food shock which struck us in the fourth quarter of last year and which is having an important impact on prices in the present period. We will do what is necessary to deliver price stability in the medium term. You can deduce whatever conclusion you judge appropriate from that. It seems to me that we have proved in the past that we were able to do whatever was necessary to deliver price stability, including in two periods in particular. In one period, namely in 2004, we were at the level of 2% for short-term interest rates, while others were at the level of 1% and we were called upon constantly to decrease rates. We believed that our monetary policy stance at the time was in line with the delivery of price stability. In another period, namely in December 2005, everybody was asking us not to start increasing rates and we did it. As regards the collateral, we have not changed our collateral policy since the introduction of the euro. Since 1 January 1999 we have had the same collateral policy, which we have not changed, and we are certainly eager to have the best possible collateral checking at all times. I have already said - anticipating your remark - that our 320 million fellow citizens are asking us to be faithful to our mandate. It seems to me that a number of observers, including market participants, often forget that we have a mandate, and that this mandate is clear. If we need any confirmation that we have to be faithful to our mandate, this would certainly come from the 320 million fellow citizens of the euro area, who are asking us to deliver price stability. They know very well that we are not ourselves able to modify the price of oil when there is a commodity price shock at the global level. However, they are asking us to deliver price stability in the mediumterm. This is our mandate. So, I will very much echo what you said. That said we believe that the present monetary stance is precisely in line with this objective. To my knowledge, we are the only central bank among those which have had to cope with exceptional tensions that has not changed its collateral policy since the very beginning of its existence. We regularly review the processes, see how they evolve, but we have not changed our concept. We have been lucky enough to have the possibility of 3-months refinancing since the very beginning, which was not the case on the other side of the Atlantic or over the Channel. Since the very beginning, we have had the capacity to take private paper, which was not necessarily the case for other central banks. That said, as we intended from the outset, we are very cautious and take pains to have the best collateral fully in line with our initial, unchanged concept. I think that it is certainly a wake-up call, and caution is required as far as fiscal policies are concerned. I trust that what I said on behalf of the Governing Council is important. I mentioned that the Eurogroup had confirmed the Berlin Agreement that was approved last year. It is very important that this commitment by the Eurogroup and ECOFIN is fully respected. It is, as you know, our constant position. There are other elements that we also have to take into consideration, elements that are probably associated with differences in various bonds liquidity, as well as the across-the-board correction that we see in spreads in financial markets in general. I think that it is too early to draw definitive conclusions from this observation, which could also be made in respect of a very large area of markets, certainly treasuries, as you just said, but also, private paper, across the board. Again, we are closely observing this ongoing correction, which is affecting all markets, and is a sign of the times. "
2008-02-07,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. This decision reflects our assessment that risks to price stability over the medium term are on the upside, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth. The current short-term upward pressure on inflation must not spill over to the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium and long term is of the highest priority to the Governing Council, reflecting its mandate. Against this background, the Governing Council remains committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. As the reappraisal of risk in financial markets continues, there remains unusually high uncertainty about its overall impact on the real economy. While the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, incoming data have confirmed that the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest information on economic activity around the turn of the year points to a more moderate pace of growth in the euro area than the quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8% observed in the third quarter of 2007. This assessment is in line with indicators for business and consumer confidence which, while having declined over the past few months, overall remain consistent with ongoing growth. Looking ahead, while the slowdown in the economies of some of the euro area’s major trading partners is likely to have an impact on euro area real GDP growth in 2008, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing growth. This assessment is broadly in line with available forecasts from private and public-sector sources. The fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound. The euro area economy does not have major imbalances Profitability has been sustained and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. As a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation, the number of people employed and labour force participation have increased significantly. Consumption growth should therefore continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with real disposable income, and investment growth should provide ongoing support. That said, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth is unusually high and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity have been confirmed to lie on the downside. Risks relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments on financing conditions and economic sentiment, with negative effects on world and euro area growth. Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional oil and other commodity price rises, concerns about protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments due to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate the annual HICP inflation rate was 3.2% in January 2008, compared with 3.1% in December 2007. This confirms the continued strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term, stemming mainly from strong increases in commodity prices, in particular oil and food prices, in recent months. Looking ahead, the annual HICP inflation rate will most likely remain significantly above 2% in the coming months and moderate only gradually in the further course of 2008. This confirms our expectation of a protracted period of temporarily high rates of inflation. Moreover, it is important to stress that the moderation in the rate of inflation which is embedded in the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections is based on the assumption that the recent rises in commodity prices will be partly reversed, in line with futures prices. More fundamentally, the projections assume that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on HICP inflation do not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour. Risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are confirmed to lie on the upside. These risks include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions. Furthermore, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, could be stronger than expected. At this juncture, it is therefore imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from current inflation rates be avoided. In the view of the Governing Council, this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium run and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. Indexation of nominal wages to the consumer price index should be avoided. Finally, further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth, although declining somewhat in December, remained very vigorous at 11.5%, whereas M1 growth continues to moderate, reflecting the dampening impact of higher interest rates. Broad money dynamics in recent quarters are likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, notably the flattening of the yield curve, which may have supported some substitution into monetary assets. Overall, taking these special factors into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. This conclusion is supported by the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.1% in December. Although the growth of household borrowing has moderated further over the past few quarters, reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. Bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations was 14.4% higher at the end of December 2007 than a year earlier. For the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August 2007 has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. In particular, according to the available data, increased financial market volatility has not led to substantial portfolio shifts into monetary assets, as was the case between 2001 and 2003. Notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area, continued strong loan growth suggests that the supply of bank credit in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. The impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on the real economy is still surrounded by unusually high uncertainty. Incoming data have confirmed that the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. Accordingly, we will monitor very closely all developments. The Governing Council remains committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. It is paramount that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. Reflecting its mandate, such anchoring is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. With respect to fiscal policies, a discretionary fiscal loosening in EU countries should be avoided. There is ample evidence that activist fiscal policies were not effective in stabilising European economies but rather led to sustained increases in the ratios of government expenditure and debt to GDP. Allowing the free operation of automatic stabilisers in countries with strong fiscal positions and safeguarding the long-term sustainability of public finances are the best contributions that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. Countries with fiscal imbalances are urged to make further progress with consolidation, in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. There is a clear risk that some countries will fail to comply with the provisions of the preventive arm of the Pact, thereby undermining its credibility. Structural reforms help economies to adjust to adverse shocks, foster productivity growth and increase employment and competition, thereby also helping to reduce inflationary pressures. In particular, enhancing competition in the services sectors and network industries, as well as applying adequate measures in the EU agricultural market, would be conducive to price stability in the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * My second question is: what options did you deduce regarding interest rates, whether there were voices for an interest rate increase or decrease? And my third question concerns how the Governing Council interprets the Federal Reserve’s actions over the last few weeks, and the key here is, by the way, not what the Fed did, but your interpretation which is: do you interpret this as an effort to stop an economic contraction that is already underway or a highly proactive effort to add risk management in the future in the United States, because I think that this has some bearing on how you would see the future as related to the euro zone. As regards the first question: as you know, it is in one month’s time that we will have the new staff projections, and thus a new base-line scenario. I would only mention that we said – and I said on behalf of the Governing Council at the last press conference – that the risks that we were perceiving were on the downside. And if you compare the introductory statement with that presented at the previous press conference, you will see we insisted much more on the risks, risks which were mentioned in the important paragraph at the very beginning of the introductory statement. So, what I said today on behalf of the Governing Council is that incoming data have confirmed that the risks to the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. But I will not, at this stage, make any other reference to the so-called base-line scenario. I did not mention base-line scenario in the introductory statement, and I will only say that we will, of course, have the staff projections next month. As regards your second question on the options, I will say that we were unanimous in deciding to maintain rates at 4 %, which was our decision today – certainly an important decision. And there was no call for an increase of rates and no call for a decrease of rates. So, we were unanimous, but that does not mean that we did not discuss very thoroughly all the elements that are making up the situation we are facing at the global level and at the European level. In the euro area, we live in a multi-dimensional universe which is demanding a thorough analysis. And at the end of this very thorough analysis, we were unanimous and there was no call for an increase or a decrease in rates. As regards your third question I have always told you that all of my colleagues – in the Governing Council, or in the Monetary Policy Council, or in the Open Market Committee – take decisions on the basis of their respective mandate and responsibilities that are very important and heavy, taking into account different economies and different situations, the various features, including structural features, of their economies and the different shocks they have to cope with. So, I take it that the Fed has taken its decision on the basis of its analysis which is clear. I have always told you that, where the US economy is concerned, I have always stuck to the analysis of the Fed, and this has proved to be a wise position in the past. My understanding is that, in taking the decision it has taken, the Fed has considered the evolution of the various parameters, including the risk of a strong slowdown of economic activity, and the alleviation of inflationary pressures that would be associated with this strong slowdown of the US economy. Remember, on both sides of the Atlantic, we say that price stability is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation. We say that ourselves, because it is the underlying reasoning of the European democracies: it is our mandate to maintain price stability, our primary goal. On the other side of the Atlantic, you will find this understanding of price stability being a prerequisite for sustainable long-term growth and job creation embedded in speeches of both the Chairman and the members of the Open Market Committee. Secondly, you’ve said you confirm that the growth risks are to the downside. Would you say those risks have materialised? And third, in the past you’ve acknowledged that the word “vigilance” has a certain predictive power, notwithstanding the Governing Council’s non-pre-committal stance. Does that word have the same predictive power when rates might be going down as it did when they were going up? On the first question: again, what the Governing Council says today by my voice is that we remain committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. This issue is a very important one. You know that our main message is that we do not want second-round effects, and when we say second-round effects, we are addressing two major possible destabilisations. One is price-setting, and we are observing in some parts of the euro area economy a level of price-setting which is not in line with what we should observe in an economy with a high level of competition. And I’m speaking in particular of food prices, for instance, in some parts of the euro area economy. And we also mention the social partners deciding on wage-setting. So this is extraordinarily important because it is the only way we have to avoid the disanchoring of inflation expectations, the only way we have to be able to deliver price stability in the medium run, which is our mandate, our primary goal. As regards your third question I will not comment on vigilance in the other direction. No comment. You had another question? I said that incoming data that we had, even if mixed in some domains – we had data that were more positive than expected by economists, including the Ifo institute for instance, or data as regards industrial production that on a month to month basis might be better than expected – but if I take all the data and all the surveys that have been made, I would say that they confirm that risks lie on the downside. And of course we have the international environment and the analysis of the Federal Reserve I just mentioned. Secondly, could you give us your assessment of the credit conditions in the euro area at the moment and the impact it might have on growth and investment. And thirdly, are you worried about the increasing amount of mortgage-backed securities that some European banks are posting as collateral at the ECB and how do you see these stocks as being unwound? On the first question, as you know, we have a very clear concept, which is that we are never pre-committed and we are always alert at any time and always ready to take the decision that would permit price stability to be delivered. That’s as simple as that. And I think it is something which has characterised our actions since the setting-up of the ECB in all periods. We had periods when we were increasing rates, periods when we were going in the other direction, and we had periods when we maintained rates for quite a long period of time. But even when we maintained rates, for instance, for a long period of time, we always said,”we are alert and we can move any time”. We never said we are pre-committing to whatever monetary policy stance in the medium term or in two months’ time, three months’ time or four months’ time. So, again, we remain constantly alert to make sure that we deliver price stability. As regards your second question as you know, because we published it – and we were very prompt to publish it because we wanted to have this bank lending survey as soon as possible – we observed that there was a tightening of credit conditions. So this is an element that we have clearly in mind. On the other hand, and I am speaking very carefully, up to now, when we look at all data that are available, what we are observing on the credit side, and I mentioned that in the introductory statement, is that we continue to have very, very dynamic credit as regards in particular non-financial corporations. It has increased from month to month to culminate at the moment I am speaking at a level which is higher than 14%. 14% is very, very dynamic credit outstanding, obviously. We are observing a slowing down of other components, other counterparts of M3, which is fully in line with the decisions we have taken as regards interest rates since December 2005, particularly as regards credit to households and credit for house purchase. This is fully in line with the decisions we have been taking. It doesn’t seem to be directly associated with the financial turbulence, so for the present moment what we have in front of us, which calls as I said for further analysis –very deep analysis, are data that are not reflecting what we have observed since June/July and certainly August, which was the start of the turbulent episode on the financial markets and credit market. As regards your third question as you know, there is a difference between the ECB and a number of other central banks, not all central banks but a number of other central banks, which is that because we had merged at the origin the concepts of a large number of national central banks, we had from the very beginning, as regards the instruments of monetary policy implementation and the refinancing of commercial banks , more tools than others that were available to the Governing Council. For instance, since the very beginning we have had not only the weekly main refinancing operations but also the three-month longer-term refinancing operations. We have been since the beginning open to collateral that is not only Treasuries but also private paper. Since the very beginning we have accepted – of course provided certain conditions are met – private paper such as ABSs or bank loans. So we didn’t change anything. When we had to cope with the financial turbulence we utilised the concepts and the instruments that had been decided at the very beginning and we did not invent any new tools or any new instruments. So what has been observed – and I don’t want to speak for all the central banks, but I think that on the other side of the Atlantic you would probably observe more or less the same evolution in the turbulent episode which started in August and that we still are experiencing – I would say is that Treasuries were less utilised by banks as collateral, and other paper, including private paper, were more utilised. And we have observed that on both sides of the Atlantic. But as far as we are concerned, we have changed nothing; we have maintained exactly the same concept and the same rules We will certainly continue to apply our rules. As you know, we have rules as regards the ratings of these instruments, we have rules as regards the quality of the instruments. For instance, if I take the asset-backed security, we ask for true sale, we ask for bankruptcy remoteness so that they would not be trapped if there was a problem in the bank in question, and so forth. So we have our rules, we apply our rules and we of course stick to our rules. I said what I said. And I also said that we were unanimous in considering that keeping rates unchanged today, which is – as I have said – an important decision, will allow us to deliver price stability in the medium run. And that is the point because it is our mandate. As regards monetary policy, I will let you be the judge of what the appropriate qualification is. Again, what we have always done, since the very beginning, has been to take decisions which will allow us to deliver price stability in the medium term in constantly changing circumstances. And as I have said, we are in a multi-dimensional situation which requires all elements to be taken into account. As regards the other questions that you had? Again, I do not comment on the exchange rate here, as you know. What I would say is that we have no reason to change our perception of growth potential, and there is general agreement on that. I do not want to say that we have, at the moment, a clear view on what the present medium-term trend is. I would say, however, that the information and data we have – including those data which are, I would say, less flattering than had perhaps been expected – certainly confirm that growth is ongoing. And how does this ongoing growth compare with growth potential? I would say that it is close to potential, but perhaps at the lower end of growth potential. I would say that it seems to me that I am in line with what is presently being said by a large number of observers and public and private institutions. For instance, if I take the OECD, or if I take the Consensus forecasts which have been published recently, even in mid-January, I see a number of forecasts of around 1.8% growth for this year. We will see what our staff will suggest. And my second question, picking up on the point about the use of residential mortgage-backed securities, is: Can you give us some idea – figures if possible, and a qualitative feel if not – of how much more is being used as collateral in ECB market operations? Is this not a case of the ECB bailing out banks facing problems? That seems to be the accusation that’s floating around the markets. Would you like to comment on that? And one final thing, just going back to monetary policy: Since the end of 2005 you have won lots of plaudits for being predictable, for we always knew a month in advance when rates were going to change. Is that going to remain the case? On your first question: As I have just said, we are constantly alert and we never pre-commit in the medium term. So I will only say that in the months to come, which will be characterised by a very high level – an unusually high level – of uncertainty, we will continue to do all that is necessary in order to deliver price stability in the medium term and solidly anchor inflation expectations. We will see what happens. A lot of things can happen on all sides. We could have new developments in this ongoing turbulent episode. We could have bad or good surprises coming from the rest of the world. The question of whether or not, and to what extent, the emerging world will offset the slowdown in the US economy is still open. We will have the evolution of the wage negotiations I was talking about, which are important. We will have the evolution of the price-setting that we are observing. And we are in a universe where it would be very naive to claim that you knew in advance everything that could happen. What is certain is that we have an anchor. We have only one needle in our compass, as I have always said, which is that we have to deliver price stability in the medium term. And we measure very carefully by all means – and they are numerous – the anchoring of inflation expectations, which we consider to be absolutely essential not only in order to deliver price stability in the medium run, but also in order to contribute to the calming down of the financial turbulence, and I have said that many times. So, we will do whatever is necessary. Today, as I have told you, we considered, looking at all the information available to us, that the appropriate decision was to keep rates unchanged at 4%, and there were no calls inside the Governing Council for increases or decreases in rates. We were unanimous. And this is something that you will certainly have noticed, because I said that when responding to the very first question of today. As regards asset-backed securities, again we have not changed our rules. We have kept the rules as they were. Other central bankers have changed their rules because they had, perhaps, fewer instruments and fewer tools available than they would have liked, taking into account their own traditional practices. I would say that it is clear that all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have noted a relative increase in the use of collateral in the form of private paper and a relative decrease in the use of paper in the form of treasuries bills. I would not say in any respect, on either side of the Atlantic, that institutions are being bailed out. Institutions are regularly making losses, as you can see. So they have their losses and they take their losses, and we are certainly not bailing everybody out. I have responded to that remark before. You had a third question? Again, predictability for us lies in the fact that, at the moment of the decision of the Governing Council, surprises have been extremely rare – and that will certainly continue in my opinion. We are very clear on our own strategy, we are clear on our goal, and we are clear on our monetary policy concept. Everybody knows that we have only one needle in our compass. We have an arithmetic definition of price stability which is clear. And so, there are a lot of good reasons why we are predictable. We have been predictable in the past, and we will continue to be predictable in the future. But again, predictability does not mean that we will pre-commit in the medium run. On the contrary, I would make the point again that we do not pre-commit in the medium run. And we believe that, if we have been exceptionally successful to date in the anchoring of inflation expectations in line with our definition of price stability, and we have been exceptionally successful in achieving very low volatility in these inflation expectations in the medium and long run, it has been precisely because we have been constantly alert, and observers, market participants and economic agents have known that we were constantly alert. And a second question related to fiscal policy, do you think the European Commission ought to take firmer steps against countries related to their budget deficits, and related to that, is an early warning for France appropriate in your view? On the G7 you know, because I always say that I do not comment myself in advance on the meeting of the G7, I will have a press briefing after the meeting of the G7 in Tokyo and then I will say what we will have discussed and decided in terms of a communiqué wording, so, at this stage, no comment. On fiscal policy the sentiment of the Governing Council is very clear –it is essential for Europe to stick to the rules. We have a Stability and Growth Pact. The Stability and Growth Pact has been designed, I would say, both to address the long-term, medium/long-term soundness of the various economies that make up the euro area and Europe as a whole. As you know, the Stability and Growth Pact is for the 27, and we are in a universe where it is very important not to lose sight of the long-term conditions for sustainable growth and job creation, in particular as regards the level of public spending as a proportion of GDP, the level of deficit and so forth. We also have the possibility, when things are run correctly in good times of the automatic stabilisers able to function. If we were all in Europe behaving as properly as possible according to the rules, then the functioning of the automatic stabilisers would be very substantial. So, again, you could see that the Governing Council is very firm on that and it calls for all countries to strictly implement the Stability and Growth Pact. And I have to say that we fully support the Commission, which is the guardian of the Stability and Growth Pact in this respect. I don’t want to say in advance what would be the communiqué of the G7, but on other issues, I can At the level of the international community and certainly of the G7, as you know, we have agreed on the methodology. We will have a provisional report, a progress report, which will be made and presented by the Financial Stability Forum to the G7. The Financial Stability Forum itself is the pool of a large number of workshops and committees that are working very actively to draw the lessons from the present episode of financial turbulence. So it’s really a very large number of workshops and committees, including the Basel Committee, you were speaking of banks, that is working actively to permit the Financial Stability Forum to advance its work. We will have the report of the Financial Stability Forum to the ministers and governors in Tokyo. Then there is the definitive report based on work to continue very actively in a number of domains and that would be presented at the following meeting of the G7 which will take place in Washington on the occasion of the IMF/World Bank spring meetings. As regards the question on the private sector, I would say that my own position, is that, in a number of domains, it is very good that you ask the private sector to work out what would be the code of appropriate conduct, or whatever you call it, set of principles, benchmark principles that would be considered by the industry as being the appropriate, fit and proper conduct in a number of domains. We utilised this methodology after the Asian crisis, and it worked well in a number of domains. We have utilised this methodology recently in the domain of the sovereign risks to prevent or tackle a crisis, e.g. we have the possibility of debt risk scheduling and so forth, and it worked well and we have principles that are agreed upon by a very large number of countries and private sector participants. So, it’s a good methodology – that does not exclude that if it is impossible for the private sector to deliver, or if the delivery is not convincing or if, again, it is impossible to have a consensus of the market participants and of the private sector entities, then, of course, it is always possible, and in some cases, very important and useful, to embark on regulation, that’s clear. Now, of course, regulations themselves, which exist in terms of banking prudentials, of insurance prudentials, of market prudentials and market surveillance and so forth, have to be permanently updated and upgraded themselves, and we did that after the Asian crisis, we certainly have to do that taking into account the present turbulences and it is a work in progress., So, again, we have to progress on a very large front, the rules and regulations have to be improved to be up to date with our observations. The experience that we have today shows that we are certainly not at the optimum and because of that we have to make progress on a large front also with the private sector and again, not excluding regulation, give the private sector a chance to work out itself what would be in its view its own self-regulation. That’s my sentiment. And the second question is on fiscal policy. You have been very categorical in rejecting the usefulness of discretionary fiscal policy. The US is just about to implement a discretionary fiscal package which was supported by a large number of economists, international institutions, and even the Fed. Does your rejection of this instrument have to do with the fact that the European economy might react differently from the US economy to such packages or is it that you have a different view of how the economy operates? On the first question, I do not want to launch into the discussions that take place in the Basel Committee chaired by Nout Wellink, the governor of the central bank of the Netherlands, and the work of the Financial Stability Forum, which is also examining the report of the Basel Committee. So I think that we have to be very careful in this respect and see what would be the provisional and, when the time comes, definitive conclusion of these discussions. What is clear, in my opinion, is that we have – through the banking prudentials as well as through all other possible grids –to look at what is procyclical in the present set of rules and behaviour and try to avoid procyclicality, because one of the lessons of the present observations is that there is probably a tendency for parts of global finance to be much too procyclical. So I do not exclude the possibility that some changes will be proposed in order to be less procyclical. We will see what happens. But, as you know, under the present Basel II Agreement there is certainly always a possibility for the banking surveillance authority to augment the capital requirement – according to Pillar 2 – on top of what would be suggested by Pillar 1, which is the computation of the appropriate capital requirement – whether you use a sophisticated methodology or a more standard methodology. But, in any case, you always have the possibility, on the basis of an assessment made by the surveillance authority, to increase the capital requirements. So this particular point is already embedded in the present methodology of Basel II. As regards our fiscal position, again, I said that for monetary policy we have different economies, different features, structural features of the economy and different shocks that we have to cope with. One important difference between the US and Europe which I have to underline – at least at the level of the single economy, with a single currency, the 320 million people that are making up the euro area – is that we are balanced. We are financing our investment with our savings and we have no domestic or external imbalances. We are balanced. In the US, as you know, you have a big level of imbalance. That makes a difference on the two sides of the Atlantic. I mention that en passant but it is something which deserves to be underlined. Let me also say that when I look at the level of public spending as a proportion of GDP, we are very significantly higher in the euro area in comparison with the US. So when I say “let the automatic stabilisers do their work”, it means something much more important as a proportion of GDP in our own case than in the United States of America. So, again, when you look at the precise situation on both sides of the Atlantic, you see that you have to take everything into account. We have to take into account the Stability and Growth Pact. It is not just a matter of the Commission, which is the guardian of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Stability and Growth Pact has been decided by the governments themselves. We did not sign the Stability and Growth Pact. It is not the Commission that signed the Stability and Growth Pact. It has been signed by the governments: the unanimous governments of the European Union and, of course, the euro area. I will say that I have enormously appreciated the fact that the Secretary of the Treasury and Ben Bernanke said that a strong dollar was in the interests of the United States of America. And my other question would basically be – it’s just something that’s just popped up – bond insurers and re-ratings of bond insurers seem to be a big issue at the moment and Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann just said, if I read it correctly, that the rating downgrades of bond insurers could be a tsunami-like event comparable to sub-prime. So is that something that you’re concerned with? I never subscribe myself to the theory of decoupling. I always said that we were in a world which was interdependent and that, all things being equal of course, if any component of the world goes up or down it has an influence on all the other components. We are ourselves influencing the rest of the world very much; the European Union is the first commercial entity of the world. The euro area is a very important commercial entity and from that standpoint we are very much at the level of the United States of America, so through the trade channel we have both, I would say, a great influence. I think that those who were speaking of decoupling had in mind that you could have simultaneously in the world for instance a business cycle which would be very much on the downside in the United States and a business cycle which would continue to be on the upside in the emerging world, particularly in emerging Asia., But that in my opinion doesn’t mean decoupling because it’s clear that, all things being equal, if the US had not gone down quite strongly, then of course the emerging Asia would have gone up even more. It is clear that all elements that we have in mind are confirming that the downside evolution of the real economy in the US is likely even if we have to be totally pragmatic and depending on facts and figurs. And we will see what happens and what we have today is that China, India and the Asian countries continue to have very significant dynamism, and the offsetting of the US slowdown could be partially or more than partially be done by Asia. But at this stage I really think that decoupling is not an appropriate word. We have to take absolutely all elements into account. As regards your second question on the insurers again, you remember we always considered in this press conference that what we were observing was an ongoing market correction with episodes of turbulence and episodes of high levels of volatility and that it was an ongoing correction across a very large array of different markets. In line with the diagnosis that we made a long time ago, before the start of the turbulences and that I reported to you concerning the fact that we had in a large array of different markets an underpricing of risks, a level of volatility, a level of spreads, a level of risk premia, which were too low. So the fact that this correction continues in various markets is not something which should surprise us, it's an ongoing process again, and I will certainly not call it a tsunami or anything of that sort, but I would say that we have to remain very alert. I said myself that we were continuing to observe this market correction. Let me say, also for your information, that we have decided today that we would renew the supplementary long-term refinancing operations of 23 November 07 and 12 December 07. You might remember it’s the additional long-term refinancing that we had decided on last year that were of the level of €60 billion each and we are renewing those operations. So there is no change but when they reach maturity they will be renewed. You will have a press release providing further information on this decision of the Governing Council today. On your first remark I must confess that central banks are used to hearing that from time to time and, if I measured the level of decibels on behind the curve and ahead of the curve and so forth, I would say that, perhaps on this side of the Atlantic, we had slightly fewer decibels than what I could observe on the other side. But what I can say is that we are doing our job. Our job is very important and we take our decisions on the basis of our mandate. And our mandate – price stability – permits us very clearly to contribute – precisely through price stability, which is our primary goal – to long-term sustainable growth and job creation. And let me only mention that one of the biggest successes of the euro area in the real economy, which is absolutely remarkable since the setting-up of the euro, is that we have created a huge number of jobs – more than in the US, to be clear – and that the first nine years of the euro have been, from that standpoint, remarkably successful. And I want to insist on that, because it is not a well-known fact. I would say that, on both sides of the Atlantic, again, we are used to observers and remarks and so forth. I trust that we are doing what is necessary. There is a good criteria, which is to see exactly what you do in terms of anchoring medium term inflationary expectations, and from that standpoint it seems to me that our own results are solid. As regards the money market evolution it is true, and we are very satisfied with this on both sides of the Atlantic, that the tensions, as far as we measured them, have undoubtedly diminished and, depending on the measure, you could say that they progressively came down from a very high level and now we are – as regards the spread between the three-month rate and the overnight rate in three months’ time, which is a good measure, perhaps, of the tension – we are probably around 40 basis points now. However, having said that, we considered that we had to consolidate and to accompany this progressive improvement of the situation. We judged it to be appropriate to renew these long-term refinancing operations. We have mentioned already publicly that we were extremely satisfied with the cooperation we had with the Fed in December; that it worked very well and it contributed certainly very significantly to the improvement of the situation of the money market and the appeasement of tensions. We were also very satisfied with what we were doing with the Fed and with the Swiss National Bank in January. We said that, at the present moment – after the good results we obtained with this dollar supply on this side of the Atlantic – taking into account the need of our own market, it was not necessary to continue, and the Swiss National Bank made the same observation. We will see what happens and, again, we are totally pragmatic. If, at any time, it appears that it is opportune to reactivate such a concept, we will do it, but at this stage it looked unnecessary, both for us and for the Swiss National Bank. Thank you very much for your attention. "
2008-01-10,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our first press conference of 2008. Let me therefore wish you all a very Happy New Year. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Cyprus and Malta as countries which have adopted the euro as their currency. With Cyprus and Malta, the euro area now comprises 15 EU Member States. Accordingly, Mr Orphanides, the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus, and Mr Bonello, the Governor of the Central Bank of Malta, became members of the Governing Council on 1 January 2008. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. According to the latest information, strong short-term upward pressure on inflation has continued, with HICP inflation remaining at 3.1% in December. As regards the medium term, and in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth, our assessment of upside risks to price stability has been fully confirmed. The Governing Council remains prepared to act pre-emptively so that second-round effects and upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and, consequently, medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. Reflecting its mandate, such anchoring is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. However, the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still accompanied by uncertainty about its potential impact on the real economy and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity are on the downside. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest information on economic activity suggests that quarterly growth at the turn of the year was at a more moderate pace than the quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8% observed in the third quarter of 2007 (revised upwards from 0.7%). This assessment is in line with indicators for business and consumer confidence which, while declining over the past few months, generally remain at levels that continue to point to ongoing growth. Our main scenario remains that of real GDP growth broadly in line with trend potential. The fundamentals of the euro area economy are sound, profitability has been sustained, employment growth has been robust and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. Consumption growth should therefore continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with real disposable income, and investment growth should provide ongoing support. On the expectation that the global economy will, on balance, remain resilient – with the slowdown in economic growth in the United States being mitigated by the continued strength of emerging market economies – external demand should support euro area exports. That said, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains high and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. The latter relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and economic sentiment, with a negative impact on world and euro area growth. Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional oil and other commodity price rises, concerns about protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments due to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate the annual HICP inflation rate was 3.1% in December 2007, unchanged from November. This confirms the strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term, stemming mainly from strong increases in oil and food prices in recent months. Looking ahead, the annual HICP inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months and is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008. Hence, the period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected. Moreover, it is important to stress that the expectation of a moderation in the rate of inflation – which is embedded in the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections – assumes some reversal of the recent rises in commodity prices – in line with what is currently captured by futures prices – and, more fundamentally, that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on HICP inflation do not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour. Risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. These risks include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account capacity constraints and the positive developments in labour markets. Furthermore, the pricing power of firms – notably in market segments with low competition – could be stronger than expected. At this juncture, it is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from current inflation rates be avoided. In the view of the Governing Council, this is absolutely essential in order to preserve price stability in the medium run and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area countries with particular attention. Any indexation scheme of nominal wages to prices should be eliminated. Finally, further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far, could materialise. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Money and credit have both continued to grow vigorously in recent months. The annual growth rate of M3 in November, unchanged at 12.3%, is likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve, the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups. Nonetheless, even taking these special factors into account, the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. Moreover, the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.0% in November, points to the continued vigour of underlying monetary dynamics. Monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to form a better understanding of shorter-term monetary dynamics. Such monitoring will also provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important at present given recent financial market developments. Heightened financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby complicate the extraction of the underlying trend monetary developments. At the same time, monetary and credit data can also offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market turmoil. For the time being, however, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August 2007 has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. Indeed, the growth of bank loans to the domestic private sector has remained robust in recent months, which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired thus far. The growth of M1 and household borrowing have moderated further over the past few quarters, reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 rather than the influence of the financial turmoil. Borrowing by non-financial corporations remains very strong. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks’ balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. At the same time, the potential impact on the real economy of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets remains uncertain. Consequently, we will monitor very closely all developments. The Governing Council remains prepared to act pre-emptively so that second-round effects and upside risks to price stability do not materialise and, consequently, medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. Reflecting its mandate, such anchoring is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. Turning to fiscal policy, most euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes. On this basis, after a reduction in the euro area aggregate deficit ratio in 2007, an increase in the ratio is projected for 2008 despite many countries not having achieved sound fiscal positions. There is a clear risk that some countries will fail to comply with the provisions of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby undermining the credibility of the Pact. In 2008 some countries with fiscal imbalances will consolidate by less than the required minimum of 0.5% of GDP in structural terms. In these countries, much more ambitious policies will be necessary to ensure that they achieve their medium-term objectives by 2010 at the latest, in accordance with their commitment of April 2007. With regard to structural reforms, the new three-year cycle of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs has started. While the achievements made over the last three years of the relaunched Strategy are encouraging, it is important that governments step up their reform efforts to deliver enhanced knowledge and innovation, competitiveness and labour market flexibility. Such reforms are crucial to raising productivity and fostering employment opportunities in the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * I think that you have missed the point. I said on behalf of the Governing Council that we were prepared to act pre-emptively, so that second-round effects and upside risks to price stability would not materialise and that, consequently, inflation expectations would remain anchored. We are in a position of total alertness, and we are saying very clearly to all decision-makers in all countries, in the whole euro area – and that means a great number of decision-makers in the public and in the private sector, in the 15 countries that are members of the euro area – that we are calling upon them not to permit a spiralling of this headline inflation, which originates from oil and commodity prices, which also comes from, as we all know, food prices at present and from a number of decisions that were taken earlier, particularly in the field of indirect taxes, and administrative prices. We are telling all of them that we will not tolerate their engaging in any spiralling. It is our responsibility and we are totally alert. We are calling upon them to behave properly, in circumstances that are – as you have said – demanding. I repeat: we will not tolerate a materialisation of these risks. That is clear. We are not in a position to engage in trade-offs. We are telling them the following: you can take whatever decision you want, it is your responsibility, but we warn you in advance not to let it contribute to a spiralling of current headline inflation in the medium term through what we call second-round effects. These effects are not only to be found in the wage settlements – although wage settlements are a very great, perhaps even a dominant element. We also have all the other price setting mechanisms. Again, we are fulfilling our mandate, which is absolutely clear, namely to deliver price stability in the medium term. We are experiencing a protracted period of high inflation, because of a number of factors which are not under our own control and, amongst those factors I would mention not only oil, commodity and food prices, but also a number of decisions that have been taken by the governments, and also by the parliaments, in a number of countries. Decision makers know and everybody knows that we are here to guarantee price stability in the medium term. That is clear. As you know, we do not vote and have never voted in the past. Today, we took a consensus decision on the basis of the explanation that I just gave in the introductory statement. Our message is very clear: no second-round effects. That being said, I would say that we had a very important discussion, weighing up very carefully the pros and cons of the various positions that we could take, and ultimately came to the decision, – by consensus – that I have just explained. My second question is just on this matter of acting pre-emptively. That word suggests to me that if you are prepared to act pre-emptively, we are staring down the barrel of a significant number of wage negotiations. Why not act? What exactly are you aiming at, I mean, if you are going to act pre-emptively then now would seem to me to be the time. And my third question is, I wanted to ask if you could comment on the developments in the credit markets, specifically the interbank market seems to have relaxed considerably, especially in the wake of your unexpected Christmas gift of the most recent liquidity injection, but, in particular, I wondered if you could also address the fact that there have been some changes in the corporate credit market which have indicated rising tensions, as well.. As I said, we discussed the pros and cons of increasing rates and of not increasing rates, and finally came to the decision – by consensus – that it would be appropriate not to increase rates and to communicate the strong message that I just gave you. Regarding your second question, as I have said before, the role of a central bank is to solidly anchor inflation expectations and to not let second-round effects materialise, because when they do, it is too late. The pre-emptive attitude of a central bank is therefore fundamental. We will see what happens. Our message is: you have to know that we will not tolerate the start of second-round effects. That is very clear. As for your third point, in the interbank market – by the way, we did not give a gift to anybody, as you know – I can say that we actually made money out it. But that being said I have to say that it was certainly something that highlighted the cooperation between various central banks, including ourselves, and a number of banks that had decided to cooperate together. Let me mention that today the ECB’s Governing Council has decided, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve and in the context of the term “Term Auction Facility”, to further offer US dollar liquidity in January in order to contribute to satisfying the exceptional need for dollar funding and to facilitate further normalisation of conditions in the money market. For your information, the operations will be of the same size and will be conducted according to the same procedures as those carried out in December 2007 on this side of the Atlantic. They will be settled on the 17 and 31 January 2008 respectively, with a maturity of 28 days each and for an amount of USD 10 billion each, as was the case in December. Having taken everything into account and having talked to Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve, it appeared that it was useful for a number of reasons. Again, we took this decision for the month of January. As you say, there is a swap market that is functioning and there are a number of other observations that could lead us to decide that it is not necessarily worth continuing. But, in this particular case, taking into account the fact that some tensions remain, as well as the fact that the opening up of the market in New York could be a little bit under strain owing to demands and requests coming from European banks, we think it is a right way to cooperate in the month of January. The only way I would describe it is that first we discussed those different possibilities and we agreed by consensus on both the decision and the message. No, if that were the case I would say so. I have not said that and we will continue to examine the situation and look very carefully at all the information we are getting from the markets. Secondly, can you help me understand the Governing Council’s thinking on emerging markets? Those of us who read your statements closely have noticed that over the past couple of months your characterisation of the support that the euro area economy might get from emerging markets seems to be weakening. First they would “largely offset” a US slowdown then they would “partly”, today we hear that they could “mitigate”. It sounds like you are changing your thinking. If you’re not, please let us know and if you are, please also let us know. On the impact on the real economy of the significant market correction that we are observing, I would say that it’s an ongoing process which has been envisaged for a long time as being probably unavoidable and probably also in many respects a necessary correction. And the risks for the real economy as we see them, stemming from a number of factors including this ongoing correction, are on the downside undoubtedly. That being said, when we look at all the facts and figures, whether in the surveys, in the real economy or coming from the financial sector, at the moment we see mixed signals. Some are good, such as the revising up from 0.7% to 0.8% of growth in the third quarter, as I said earlier. We see that there are surveys that hint at a diminishing of the positive balance, but most of these surveys are over the threshold which signals ongoing growth. We are in a complex environment from that standpoint. As I said on behalf of the Governing Council, our baseline scenario remains one of ongoing growth, but risks are clearly on the downside. I wouldn't say that we are convinced that the dust will settle at the moment of the publication of the certified accounts by financial institutions, as regards the financial turmoil, even though that is certainly an important moment. But I think it would be wrong to think that doubts will evaporate by virtue of this. That being said, it is the position, not only of the Governing Council but of the international community in its entirety that we call for clarity, transparency and a fair and candid picture of the situation. Because it is clear that the absence of full transparency and clarity plays a major role in complicating the functioning of a large number of markets including the money market. As regards emerging markets, there are two phenomena as seen from our standpoint on this side of the Atlantic. There is, on the one hand, the robustness of growth in the emerging markets and, on the other hand, the issue of the United States and the rest of the industrialised world apart from the euro area. In this respect the subtle changes that you noticed in the comments of the Governing Council are due not only to the emerging markets themselves but also to the risks that are associated with the developments in the industrialised world and the United States in particular. So I would rather suggest that you interpret our comments to mean that we have to take into account the fact that the risks coming from the United States seem to be strengthening. Then, of course, the “offsetting” or “mitigating” role of emerging markets, to pick two of the words that we have used, would operate in a different fashion. But up to now we have seen continuous encouraging signals coming from the emerging markets and I was able to say that recently in Basel after the global economy meeting. The response is very simple: again, we make a clear distinction between what we have to decide in order to deliver price stability, be credible in the delivery of price stability and continue anchoring solidly inflationary expectations. That is the policy stance. Then, once that has been decided, we have to ensure that the money market acts properly. But we are only influencing directly the shortest part of this money market. So, we are not particularly satisfied to see that, all over the industrialised world, not only on this side of the Atlantic but also on the other side of the Atlantic and in other industrialised countries’ money markets, we have these tensions that are the reflection in the money market of, I would say, tensions that are originating out of it and are associated with the complex market correction we are experiencing. Secondly, just to push you once more, you just said that you discussed all different options at your meeting today. Was there any discussion at all about an interest rate cut, or was the view advanced that the credit market developments and the euro foreign exchange market developments might have done some of the work for the ECB already? And my third question, very quickly: the UK is the euro zone’s largest export market and the pound has weakened quite considerably. Would you agree that a strong pound was in Britain’s interest? To take the last point first, I do not give advice to colleagues, as you know, and I have always said in this forum that we are a very strong brotherhood of mutual admiration. And so I will not say anything on the US policies or on the UK policies. On the discussion we had, let’s be absolutely clear that, for all the reasons I have given already, we are in a position of alertness, in a position of giving messages and in a position of saying very clearly that we will not accept second-round effects, because it is our mandate. So, the debate, the discussion we had was on the pros and cons of two possibilities and not three possibilities. As regards the bank lending survey, I can tell you that we will publish on Friday 18 January 2008 the results of the January 2008 bank lending survey via the usual means, press release and ECB’s Website. All I can say is that we have had some kind of first hint, but I am very cautious and prudent because we do not have the survey itself yet, although we have some preliminary sentiments which were given and which seem to confirm that there is an ongoing increase in the net tightening of credit, I would say, both for loans to enterprises and for housing loans to households. That was the very preliminary, provisional information we were given this morning. I would say that we permanently encourage Bulgaria to have the best possible control over inflation and over the other elements that characterise the present pace of the real economy in Bulgaria, and the financial and monetary economy. We expect that in Bulgaria, as well as in all the other Members States of the European Union, appropriate measures would be taken. But we have no particular message in this respect apart from saying that it is in the interest of all countries concerned to have the soundest and wisest possible policy both on the fiscal side and the monetary side. The fiscal side is very important for all sorts of reasons, particularly in the countries where you have current account deficits that are quite large and a number of other factors like inflation. So, I do not have particular message for Bulgaria, but a general message for all countries. So, what is the question, Sir? So the question is: “If things went worse, who is the lender of last resort?” As far as we are concerned, we have proven that we were able to maintain rates on the money market – those short-term rates that we directly influence – in line with our own monetary policy decisions. We will continue to consider our monetary policy stance with our primary goal of delivering price stability and being credible, and therefore anchor inflationary expectations, and we will take care of this shortest part of the money market if there are abnormal tensions. That said we are not an institution which has to take care of solvency problems. So, your question was about solvency problems – and I have to say that this is another question. We must draw a clear-cut distinction between liquidity issues and solvency issues. I have already responded many times to such questions, because – as you know – we are running a currency for 320 million people in a large number of sectors, and we have very different situations from country to country. I always say that three parameters are essential in normal times. One parameter is the present level of competitiveness in the particular sector where you are, and of course this is of great importance. A second parameter is the level of unemployment in your sector and in your economy. A third parameter is productivity, the yearly labour productivity progress that you are making. You have to take account of those three parameters. On top of that, we have today the exceptional hump in headline inflation. What we say to the unions as well as to entrepreneurs, all social partners and, of course, governments on account of the public sector, is to consider that after the temporary hump, we will be back to our definition of price stability. Take that into account. If you don’t take that into account, you will engage in the spiralling of wages and salaries, you will disanchor expectations. We have given a very clear warning of what the consequences would be. I said a word on Bulgaria, and I would say exactly the same on Slovakia, and for the whole euro area itself: sound fiscal policies, sound structural policies and sound wage and salary policies. In the case of Slovakia I will only say that the Governing Council of the ECB will very carefully examine the situation of the country within a few months, as will the European Commission. We are certainly not neutral. It’s a good interpretation of what I said. You could also say there was a very strong message to all price-setters and social partners. That was really an important part of the message. I would not correct too much what you said, but it is your own responsibility: what I said is what I said. When the Governing Council so decides. But this is not new. I have always said that we are constantly alert. And I have always said that at any given time we will do what we judge appropriate to preserve price stability. The circumstances are obviously very difficult because of the oil price, commodity prices and food prices, and because of other decisions that have been taken and that have an impact on headline inflation. And this is the reason why we have a very strong message. I said that the end of the year had passed in a way which was technically satisfactory and, in that sense some tensions which were associated with the end of the year have receded. But I never said that tensions had been eliminated, and everyone can see that we are, still, at least according to some indicators on the money market, in a situation where those tensions originating outside of the money market are reflected in the money market. It would be best to have a consensus on running sound policies. This is the case in some countries which then have very good results. So my general advice is to have policies that are as sound as possible. Fiscal policies are very important in all respects and, particularly, when you are in a catching up process where growth is quite significant. In such a position we strongly recommend that you do not hesitate to have surpluses. Of course the action is in cooperation with the United States, because it is based on an accord with the Federal Reserve System and the dollars are from a SWAP agreement that the ECB has with the US Federal Reserve System. We are responsible for a single currency, the euro, which has its own characteristics, credibility, associated interest rates and relationship with other currencies. We are running a currency for 15 countries and 15 economies and it is true that each country's situation is not the same. The Governing Council is the guardian of the currency for the 320 million citizens and it is clear that our message for the 320 million has to be understood at the level of each particular situation. I have a number of occasions to say with my colleagues – the governors of the national central banks – that in some economies indexation in particular is totally adverse to what is needed today, because precisely what is needed today is not to engage in the spiralling of prices and of wages and salaries. So it is absolutely clear that our message is particularly strong for those economies where you have, de facto or de jure inbuilt elements of indexation with all the risks that are associated with the hump being transferred to a number of prices and to wages and salaries. As you know the prices of oil and commodities go up and down. What I have said is that in our own staff projections we looked at prices at a certain moment and then the futures market indicated what would be considered the best objective information, although the volatility of prices is very significant. I have to say that the futures market does not appear to be a good predictive indicator when you look at what has happened in the past. So I would not qualify any particular short-term development. We have, unfortunately, to live with these short-term developments. As you know, we have very different monetary policy concepts in the European Union outside the euro area. I think that those central banks to which you alluded have all the means to counter – within their own responsibility and their own economy – the pressures that are coming. We are obviously all in the same situation. A number of supply shocks are there and we have all to cope with them. It is our responsibility as central bankers to continue to solidly anchor inflation expectations. We do not have exactly the same monetary policy concept on both sides of the Atlantic or on both sides of the Channel but I know the goal and the goal is exactly the same. And it should, of course, be the same for the countries that are members of the European Union without being members of the euro area. As I said, we are in a universe where you have a complex set of influences, and to disentangle the various influences and understand better what’s behind the figures that we have is a challenge. But it’s a very good challenge, because these are questions which permit us to better understand what exactly is going on in the financial sector. When we know that the present market correction is influencing all of the economy, including the real economy, it would be paradoxical if we did not examine the financial sector carefully, when it has such an influence on the real economy. And I draw your attention to the fact that, from this standpoint, our two-pillar strategy seems to me particularly pertinent, because we are in precisely a situation where the most important issue is what exactly is the influence of the financial sector on the real economy, and what are the dynamics behind it? Just to give you an example: when we look at the latest information we have on the rate of growth of loans to non-financial corporations, we have 14%, and the previous month, it was, if my memory is correct, 13.9%. So it has remained at a very high level. What is behind it exactly? We probably have very complex phenomena, including the fact that it is possible that a number of corporations are more inclined to be more liquid, perhaps to draw on their lines of credit. We perhaps have a phenomenon of re-intermediation, even if we are not sure that it is visible in those figures. We have a phenomenon of genuine dynamics of credit. It is very complex, and we are working a great deal on that. It is important. I will confirm that what we have in front of us, as you see, still very dynamic figures for the components and the counterparts of the monetary aggregates. We have also some provisional conclusions: for instance, M1 was clearly growing fast before we increased rates in December 2005, and since we engaged in this increase of rates, we have seen the dynamics of M1 decrease progressively month after month. That is a very clear evolution, in comparison with others that are very complex, calling for a better understanding. We are all working on it. I have to say that, all colleagues, including those who do not have a two-pillar strategy, would certainly not deny that it is important to do a lot of work on the financial aspects of the situation. Let me also say at the end of this press conference, just for you to know, we issued a press release at 3 p.m. on the biannual information on euro banknote counterfeiting. You will have this information as well as the one regarding the dollar liquidity operation, relying on the swap agreement with the United States, to which I alluded during this press conference, in a press release. Thank you very much for your attention. "
