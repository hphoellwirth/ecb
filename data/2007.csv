2007-12-06,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The latest information has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation, with the HICP inflation rate reaching 3.0% in November. It has also fully confirmed our assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Against this background, and with money and credit growth remaining very vigorous in the euro area, the Governing Council stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by its mandate. The economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound. However, the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and is accompanied by continued uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy. We will therefore monitor very closely all developments. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that second-round effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Firmly anchoring medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of euro area real GDP in the third quarter of 2007 was 0.7%, in line with the earlier flash estimate. Domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth in the third quarter, confirming the sustained nature of economic expansion in the euro area. The latest information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that economic growth has continued into the fourth quarter of this year, though probably at a more moderate pace than in the third quarter. Overall, the fundamentals of the euro area remain sound. Profitability has been sustained, employment growth has been robust and the unemployment rate has fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. These factors are also reflected in the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. Annual real GDP growth is projected to lie in the range of 2.4% to 2.8% in 2007, and be between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2008, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2009. In comparison with the September ECB staff projections, the range projected for real GDP growth in 2008 has been revised slightly downwards, whereas for 2007 the new range lies within the upper part of the previous one. Available forecasts from international organisations broadly confirm this outlook. The scenario of sustained real GDP growth broadly in line with trend potential is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient, with the slowdown of economic growth in the United States partly offset by the continued strength of emerging market economies. External demand should therefore provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. Consumption growth should also contribute to economic expansion, in line with developments in real disposable income, as continued employment growth provides supportive conditions. That said, in view of the potential impact of ongoing financial market volatility and re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the level of uncertainty remains high. In the Governing Council’s view, the risks surrounding this outlook for economic growth lie on the downside. They relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and confidence and on world and euro area growth, possible further oil and commodity price rises, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate increased sharply again in November 2007, to 3.0% from 2.6% in October. Oil prices have risen strongly in recent months, and food prices have increased substantially, reflecting higher global demand. In addition, as emphasised on previous occasions, we are currently in the midst of a period in which unfavourable effects from energy prices are having a strong upward impact on annual HICP inflation rates, owing to the marked decline in oil prices a year ago. Looking ahead, the HICP inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, and is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008. Hence, the period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected. The December Eurosystem staff projections foresee annual HICP inflation to be between 2.0% and 2.2% in 2007, but then to rise to between 2.0% and 3.0% in 2008. For 2009, HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.2% and 2.4%. Compared with the September 2007 ECB staff projections, the projected ranges for HICP inflation in 2007 and 2008 have shifted upwards. Forecasts from international organisations which incorporate recent inflation developments give a broadly similar picture. These projections largely mirror the assumed path of oil and food prices, for which available futures prices suggest a deceleration in the course of next year. On the domestic side, unit labour cost growth is projected to increase over the projection horizon. In this context it is important to emphasise that the staff projections assume that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on HICP inflation will not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage-setting behaviour. This is a key assumption. A further key assumption is that growth in profit margins will moderate over the projection horizon. In combination, these two assumptions imply, in the context of the staff projections, a continuation of overall contained domestic cost pressures, which contributes to the moderation in inflation projected in 2009. In the Governing Council’s view, risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. These risks include the possibility of further rises in oil and agricultural prices , continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. Moreover, taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive developments in labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge. Furthermore, an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from recent commodity price rises be avoided. To that end, any explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices should be eliminated. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Money and credit have both continued to grow vigorously in recent months. The annual growth rate of M3 in October, at 12.3%, is likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve, the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups. However, even taking these special factors into account, the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. Moreover, the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.2% in October, points to the continued vigour of underlying monetary dynamics. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to better understand shorter-term dynamics. Such monitoring will also provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important at present given recent financial market developments. Heightened financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby complicate the extraction of the underlying trend monetary developments. At the same time, monetary and credit data can also offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market turmoil. For the time being, however, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates, although specific balance sheet items, such as holdings of money market fund shares/units, may have been affected. Indeed, the growth of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations has remained robust in recent months, which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired. Further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market developments on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of vigorous money and credit growth and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. At the same time, the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy has continued. Consequently, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. Our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. In particular, for the recent increase in inflation to remain temporary, it is of the essence that no second-round effects materialise via an impact from current inflation rates on wage and price-setting behaviour. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that second-round effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. This is all the more important in the current context. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks. Turning to fiscal policy, the European Commission’s autumn 2007 economic forecast generally confirms the picture of improving budget balances in the euro area this year. However, progress with structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining budget imbalances is generally disappointing. This lack of ambition unnecessarily prolongs the correction of remaining fiscal deficits and could lead to negative surprises should the macroeconomic environment turn less favourable. In this context, Member States should meet the commitment they made in the Eurogroup’s Berlin agreement of April 2007, namely that most euro area members would achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all should aim for 2010 at the latest. With regard to structural reforms, it is important that governments continue their efforts to make progress. The improvements in the employment situation over recent years show the fruits of past reforms. It is essential that the reform momentum to enhance competition, productivity growth and labour market flexibility is maintained and that there are no reversals of the reform process in the countries of the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * As regards economic growth projections, as you have said, these are the staff projections; they are made according to the best professional standards and of course with a very high level of skill. They are not underwritten by the Governing Council, as you know; we are not in a concept where we would ourselves say “these are the Governing Council projections”. These are the staff projections. And they are an important input that we have, but they are an input. They are not our own projections. We look at all information that is provided by our staff, as a very important input, and also through other channels. What the staff has worked out as far as economic growth is concerned seems to me very much in line with the sentiment of the Governing Council that I expressed in the previous press conference, when I said that, in our opinion, we would be around potential, potential being around 2%. I don’t want to say anything else but that. As you know, we always publish ranges and not mid-points. You yourself expressed the computation of some mid-points, but what we are publishing is ranges, in order to reflect the level of uncertainty that exists for growth as well as for inflation. As regards the inflation projections, I said last time, that, as far as we were concerned, new information on oil price increases and on food products were suggesting that we would have a hump which would be higher, more protracted and longer than what had been previously projected. And this, not surprisingly, is captured in the work which has been done by the staff, with the range for 2008 of 2% to 3% and for 2009 from 1.2% to 2.4%. Again, as far as I am concerned, I give the range, I don’t give the mid-point. It is your own responsibility to do what you think you should do with the ranges that are published by the ECB as regards the staff projections. As regards your last question: it is very important for me to restate that what is absolutely decisive for all members of the Governing Council is that this working assumption of the staff as regards the absence of second-round effects be fully confirmed by what will really happen in the reality. It is absolutely fundamental, it is a key working assumption, and we will do all that is necessary to ensure that there is no materialisation of second-round effects. We must not have second-round effects. We will do what is necessary. You know that we are alert. We call upon social partners, we call upon price-setters; we call upon the corporate constituency to be fully aware of the fact that we will not tolerate second-round effects. It is essential. It is essential for the meeting of our mandate and the achievement of our primary goal of price stability in the medium term. It is essential to meet the clear demands of our 320 million fellow citizens and it is also essential to continue solidly anchoring inflation expectations and therefore to pave the way for sustainable medium and long-term growth and job creation. I think this reproach, if any, comes a little late, because I remember that when we increased rates in December 2005, most of the economists were telling us that we should not, that their economic analysis strongly recommended not doing so. I have a clear memory that the IMF said “you should not do that”, and the OECD said “you should not do that”, and I do not have many memories of editorialists, either the major international media or the national media, telling us “you should do that”. Not to mention, of course, that at the time an overwhelming majority of executive branches thought it useful to say that we should not do that. But despite the comments of executive branches, of a large majority of economists and of the two important international financial institutions I mentioned, the Governing Council decided to do it, and now we have been fully vindicated for having done what we did in December 2005. And as I have said on a number of occasions, we did it on the basis of our economic analysis and on the basis of our monetary analysis. The monetary analysis was decisive in telling us “you should do that now, even if the large majority of market participants, economists and international institutions are against it”. But again today we have been fully vindicated. At the present level of headline inflation, a number of price hikes have been observed in food products, as well as this creeping oil shock that we continue to observe. I should also mention that, at the very moment I am speaking, it seems that the impact of the VAT increase in Germany might be of the order of magnitude – at the level of the euro area – of perhaps 0.4%. It is not negligible, and it is something which was decided on the basis of very good reasons, but it had an impact, and we knew at the time that it would have a significant an impact on headline inflation. But all that being said, what is important is that we continue to anchor inflation expectations. We have this protracted hump in front of us now, and we know why. Our staff is projecting that in 2009 we are likely to be back to our definition of price stability, but it is absolutely essential that the working assumption that there will be no second-round effects is fully confirmed. And it relies on our own capacity to do whatever is necessary to prevent these second-round effects. On the first question, as always, we examine all pros and cons, all assets and liabilities associated with the possible decisions, the possible decisions being increasing rates or maintaining rates as they were. We exchanged all views on the situation. We finally decided on the basis of a consensus after having exchanged all views and weighing up the two possibilities very, carefully. On your second question, as regards 2009, we have in front of us the projections of our staff, and we also have other work which has been done by the public sector, by the OECD, by the private sector. We take all of that. What we have to do is to deliver price stability in line with our definition in the medium term. That is the needle of our compass. That is the primary goal, the primary mandate. We will do what we have to do to deliver. And the credibility of this delivery is essential to anchor inflationary expectations. We will be constantly alert. And, as you know, we never pre-commit, we are never blocked, we never tie our hands. Everybody knows that we will do whatever is necessary to deliver. As regards your third question on the sub-prime issue, I said that there is certainly a significant level of uncertainty. What I can say is that, in the figures that we are observing at present, in the figures that are available, we do not see a materialisation, in the various data, in particular in the components and counterparts of M 3, of anything which would be substantial and would correspond to major changes, to significant changes induced by the present market correction. I do not say that we will not see that in the future; on the contrary, we will have to continue to look at it very carefully and extract all information. But we are entirely pragmatic and we see the facts and the figures that we have before our eyes. This remark is also true for the real economy: at the present moment, we see the risks for the real economy on the downside, for a number of reasons that we have listed, the same reasons that I listed at the last press conference. That being said, what we have, as far as facts and figures before our eyes, and what the other institutions that are looking at us also see – and they publish their own projections and forecasts – is that we are around our potential. But that does not mean that I am sure that we will continue to have that. At the present moment, we have to be humble in front of the facts and the figures. First of all, I do not comment on any particular declaration by colleagues. I comment on the sentiment of the Governing Council as a whole. It seems to me that what has been said corresponds to the fact that we have one needle in our compass. Very often we are asked: how do you compare balance the balance of risks to inflation and the balance of risks to growth? We do not reason in that fashion, as you know. And I make the point regularly here and this was probably the intention of my colleague. We have one needle, not two, and of course the balance of risks to inflation is influenced by what we have as regards the pressure coming from the real economy, or absence of pressure, and all the other parameters that have an influence on the risks to inflation. So, no other comments on that. As regards the decoupling, we are living in a world, a global economy, which is extraordinarily complex, with trade links, financial links, confidence links, direct influences, indirect influences... So, I would say, coupling or decoupling is very much a way of seeing things as white or black which does not capture the complexity of the situation. We are all interdependent. We are all mutually influencing one another and if we have unexpected events that would come from the US or from our neighbours or from Asia and Asian emerging economies, then it has an influence. I made the point a number of times that the US was a partner, a trade partner that was less important than the UK for us when you look at the figures. I also made the point that of course the US had an influence on the rest of the world which was indirectly also influencing our own economy. I mentioned the fact that we have very buoyant economies in the emerging world and that that was certainly something which was contributing to our own baseline scenario of a global economy continuing to be relatively robust, even if a little bit less than before. But again we will see what happens. I will not get into the debate on coupling or decoupling. If any part of the world is behaving more properly, we are positively influenced. If it is behaving less properly, we are negatively influenced. And the United States is of course an important part of the global economy. That being said, all observers looking at the economy in Europe are seeing elements that suggest that we have a sound economy. It was said recently by the IMF when looking at us that they see a healthy economy with a growth which is based very much on domestic demand, as I have said. In domestic demand it is also striking that over the last twelve months that are known, so adding up the four last quarters that are known, we have a contribution to growth of investment, or gross capital formation, which is of the order of magnitude of 0.9%; a contribution of consumption which is also of the order of magnitude of 0.9%, that is for private consumption; then on top of that we have the export contribution, the net exports; we have also public consumption. Well, this makes a level of growth and a balance of contributions to growth which is obviously healthy. But again this is what we see today and we know that there are uncertainties. Your last question on the financial market functioning gives me the opportunity to restate that we have a primary goal of delivering price stability. We are inflexible on that. Anchoring inflation expectations calls for a certain monetary policy stance. And today we confirmed that 4% is what we think is appropriate, but we have also the responsibility of having the money market functioning as properly as possible at that level. This has been disputed a little bit, you might remember, in August, after the 9th and 10th of August. Now it is not disputed by anybody that we have to be up to our responsibility in this respect. It does not solve the problem. We have tensions coming from the functioning of the market and they are persistent, but it permits us to stabilise at the level that we judge appropriate the very short-term rate of the yield curve. It is certainly essential to have this solid anchoring both of the inflation expectations and of the very short-term rates, for which we have direct responsibility, at the level which we judge to be in line with the delivery of price stability. And I would say that particularly in periods of turbulences, to have a steady hand and solid anchoring is absolutely essential. Again, we have to be prudent as regards the tightening of credit standards. The latest information we have comes from our last survey, and it has been made public. You can see exactly what was observed. The figures that we have do not confirm that this tightening of credit standards – which was undoubtedly the result of this survey – has materialised in the growth rate of outstanding credit or outstanding loans. You know the figures, which remain very dynamic. The most striking figure I can think of is that of loans to non-financial corporations, which are still growing at a rate of 13.9%, which is extraordinarily rapid and does not suggest that we are experiencing a credit crunch. That being said, this is an ongoing process, and we will continue to monitor it very carefully, looking at the succession of data and of surveys available to us. As regards the issue of competition, I take your question on recent French measures as confirming that the issue of competition is essential. I have mentioned wages and salaries, and I have mentioned price setting where we must avoid second-round effects. It is absolutely clear, as regards the price setters, that the more you have a high level of intense and fierce competition in any particular economy, the more you are protected from these second-round effects. The less appropriate competition you have, the more you are vulnerable in terms of second-round effects. So we call on the whole of the euro area – not any one economy in particular, but the whole of the euro area – to reinforce competition, having competition which is as fierce as possible, in the interests of consumers, in the interests of the economy as part of the completion of the Single Market, and of course in the interests of avoiding second-round effects. The methodology applied is not new; there has been no change of methodology. Interest rates and both, oil and non-energy commodity prices, are based on market expectations with a cut-off date of 14 November 2007. With regard to short-term interest rates as measured by the three-month EURIBOR, market expectations are derived from a forward rate, reflecting a snapshot of the yield curve on the cut-off date. So this is the methodology that we usually apply, and this implies an average level of 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007, falling to 4.5% in 2008 and 4.3% in 2009. We have not changed our methodology in any respect. One can always say “well, you could use another methodology”. But it is very important that we stick to this methodology, and the staff believe that we should stick to this methodology. Our situations are not the same. We always have structural evolutions that are of great importance and are different, and I would certainly not rely on making what I would call too naïve a comparison. What is clear is that we are all placed in various situations. We have different economies. We certainly have very responsible central banks on both sides of the Atlantic, but again, we do not have the same economies. Fortunately we do not have the sub-prime mortgage issue, even if we are affected by it and know that we are affected by it. But it is not in continental Europe – it is not in the euro area – and, again, the two economies do not have the same structure. So, I will not comment on what is done on the other side of the Atlantic. I will comment on what we do taking into account all factors: the upside risks for price stability that are fully confirmed, the uncertainty in which we are presently and which is fully captured by the Governing Council, taking into account the fact that we remain constantly alert and are ready to act at any moment in order to deliver price stability. All that is part of our own understanding of the overall situation. There is nothing new in our attitude. I have always told you that we have never pre-committed; we have always been alert and have refused to make medium long-term pre-commitments. It has been the case in other economies but it is not the way that we are looking at it. We have proved in the past that this alertness and this capacity to do things, even when we were advised not to do things, was of the essence. I thought I had explained as clearly as possible that the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and is accompanied by continued uncertainty of the potential impact on the real economy. And that is why we consider that it is not opportune to decide today. But again, it does not mean that we are in any way mixing the present situation of the market correction – the significant market correction with episodes of turbulences and so on and so forth – with the monetary policy stance. The monetary policy stance is there to deliver price stability and we have – at the level at which we consider ourselves able to deliver price stability – this responsibility to have a correct functioning on the money market. I have just said that we did not mix the two responsibilities. So I say no to your question as it was presented. We did not mix the two responsibilities. Taking everything into account we consider that 4% today is what is needed to deliver price stability and we simultaneously say that we will do whatever is necessary to prevent any second-round effects. The prevention of any second-round effects is essential in today’s message. And perhaps you have noted that the Governing Council also says that we should eliminate all traces of indexation in our economies, including wage and salary indexation, and we should reinforce as fiercely as possible competition for price-setters so that there are no second-round effects. There were some. As I once said, the central bank governors are a very impressive brotherhood of mutual admiration. So, what is done by colleagues is certainly fully justified by what they are observing in their own economy. They are all totally committed to deliver price stability, as we are. "
2007-11-08,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting fully confirms that the outlook for price stability over the medium term is subject to upside risks. Against this background, and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. The economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound and support a favourable medium-term outlook for economic activity. However, the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets has led to continued uncertainty. This warrants a thorough examination of additional information before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium term-oriented monetary policy strategy focused on maintaining price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. This will favour an environment conducive to sustained economic growth, well-functioning markets and job creation. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. On the basis of the available data, it appears that the sustained real economic growth experienced in the euro area in the first half of 2007 has continued through the third quarter, as reflected in the data for industrial production and retail sales that have been released since our meeting in early October. While financial market volatility seems to have contributed to a decline in euro area consumer and business confidence indicators in the past few months, these indicators generally remain above their historical averages and continue to point to ongoing sustained growth. Overall, the fundamentals of the euro area remain sound, including in particular sustained corporate earnings and profitability, robust employment growth and falling unemployment to levels not seen for 25 years. Available forecasts for 2008 continue to confirm our main scenario of real GDP growing at around trend potential. This scenario is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient, with the slowdown of economic growth in the United States partly offset by the sustained strength of emerging market economies. Continued strong external demand should provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. Consumption growth in the euro area should also contribute to economic growth, in line with developments in real disposable income, as continued employment growth provides supportive conditions. That said, in view of the potential impact of prolonged financial market volatility and the re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the level of uncertainty surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic activity remains high. On balance, risks to the outlook for growth are judged to lie on the downside. These downside risks relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on confidence and financing conditions, further oil and commodity price rises, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate increased very strongly to 2.6% in October 2007, from 2.1% in September. This sharp increase is a matter of particular concern and it is essential that it does not affect medium to longer-term inflation expectations. To that effect, we have already indicated on previous occasions that we are now in a period during which unfavourable effects from energy prices will have a strong upward impact on annual HICP inflation rates, owing mainly to the marked decline in energy prices a year ago. In addition, these effects have been strengthened by recent substantial further increases in oil, non-oil commodity and, in particular, food prices. Overall, we expect the HICP inflation rate to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months before moderating again in the course of 2008. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. These risks include the possibility of persistently high oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months, as well as unanticipated increases in administered prices and indirect taxes. Moreover, taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters, and the positive signs from labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments may occur. Furthermore, an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. Such developments would pose upward risks to price stability. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects be avoided. In addition, the explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices should be reduced and ultimately eliminated. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. The strength of both money and credit growth in recent months – with the annual growth rates of M3 and MFI loans to the private sector both at more than 11% in September – may have been influenced by a number of temporary or special factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve and the recent financial market volatility. However, even taking into account these special factors, the underlying rate of money and credit expansion remains strong. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring so as to detect underlying trends on the one hand and to better understand shorter-term dynamics on the other. This monitoring will provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important given recent financial market developments, since financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby affect monetary developments. Monetary and credit data can therefore offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market volatility. Indeed, previous episodes of heightened financial market uncertainty have been associated with large portfolio shifts into safe and liquid monetary assets. For the time being, however, there is little evidence that such shifts have influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates since the onset of financial market volatility in early August, although specific balance sheet items, such as holdings of money market fund shares/units, may have been strongly affected. The rate of growth of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations has remained robust in recent months, tentatively suggesting that there is no impairment in credit supply. However, it cannot be excluded that the strong loan flows partly reflect the re-intermediation of some financing onto bank balance sheets given illiquidity in some segments of the asset-backed securities markets. Further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market volatility on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has fully confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term, with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. At the same time, given the continued uncertainty, additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn. Consequently, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. Our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is all the more important in the current context. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Turning to fiscal policy, the Governing Council welcomes the ECOFIN Council’s agreement to strengthen the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Governing Council also welcomes the recent confirmation by the ECOFIN Council of a reinforcement of its commitment to the full implementation of the Pact. In particular, the provisions of the preventive arm, including the call for a structural adjustment of at least 0.5% of GDP per annum, need to be adhered to by all countries with fiscal imbalances. In this regard, 2008 budget plans in a number of countries point to a pro-cyclical fiscal stance and an unwarranted relaxation of consolidation efforts. This gives rise to concern as consolidation shortfalls undermine in particular the Eurogroup agreement to achieve sound budgetary positions by 2010 at the latest. With regard to structural reforms, the Governing Council stresses that a key effect of well-designed structural reforms is a sustainable improvement in the employment and income situation of workers and households. Reforms which increase the incentives for firms and individuals to invest in human capital tend to enhance overall labour demand and productivity. Reducing non-wage labour costs would also enhance employment and the net income levels of workers. Moreover, labour market regulations should not discourage firms from offering jobs, or workers from accepting them. It is encouraging to see that past labour market reforms have contributed to job creation and reduced unemployment. It is important that governments continue in this direction and do not reverse past reforms just at the point when they are starting to bear fruit. Moreover, the Governing Council reiterates its full support for all efforts which foster market flexibility and enhance competition. This also applies to the agricultural markets. Against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices, further liberalisation and reforms in EU agricultural markets would help to enhance their efficiency and benefit European consumers through lower prices. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * As regards the financial market situation, I said that we have the same level of uncertainty as that we had mentioned after our previous meeting. I would say that this is an ongoing process, so we will continue to observe the evolution of the market very carefully. We are experiencing a multi-dimensional correction with episodes of turbulences, episodes with high level of volatility, episodes of overshooting, and again it is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon that we have to follow very carefully. On the impact of this situation on growth, I have mentioned that, at this stage and taking into account all available information, and knowing that new information will be gained in the period to come, we did not – on the basis of the information we have at the moment – change our baseline scenario. This is not particularly original, because it seems to me that it is very much the attitude taken until now by most international institutions and observers. I also stated on behalf of the Governing Council that the balance of risks was on the downside. And I say that very clearly. Risks for growth are in our judgement clearly on the downside. To your second question: I do not have any memory at all of any such declaration. Again, we are qualifying the situation as – without calling our baseline scenario into question at this stage – one of growth that would be around potential, but I also said that the risks were on the downside. And I would be surprised if the previous analysis you are referring to was not used on the same principles, because we are very consistent in the way that we, in the Governing Council, judge the situation and assess the developments. Let me repeat that there is only one Governing Council and there is only one assessment of the Governing Council, which is enshrined in the introductory remarks. I know that none of us will start departing from the introductory remarks. There might be some communication phenomena, translation, a number of interpretations – in my opinion, very much over-interpretation. So, let us be careful – there is only one Governing Council; there is only one voice for the Governing Council in the introductory remarks. And I think that this is very important. You will not be surprised when I tell you that the meeting today was a meeting at which we have come to our judgement, as always, on the basis of a very thorough examination of all arguments, looking in all directions, but we were unanimous in coming to the decision we took today. As regards the US dollar, first of all, we said in Washington in the G7 that disorderly movements of exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth. This is true, now more than ever. Secondly, we had, as you might remember, explicitly sent a clear message to a number of currencies of emerging Asian markets including the Chinese currency. Thirdly, we had noted the position of the US authorities as regards the strong dollar being in the interest of the United States. It seems to me that, in the most recent period of time, it has become even clearer that a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States. And, finally, as regards the yen, I said myself in commenting on the G7 communiqué that we appreciated what had been said by the authorities in Tokyo on the fact that the pick-up of the economy should be recognized progressively by the exchange markets. In the recent period, we have observed moves that, I would say, were undoubtedly sharp and abrupt. And I have said already that brutal moves are never welcome. As regards your last question, I confirm once again that we consider the anchoring of inflation expectations to be absolutely decisive. It is because inflation expectations are solidly anchored that we can put the European economy in a favourable environment in the medium and long run with sustainable growth and job creation. We will do what is necessary to continue to ensure solidly anchored inflation expectations. We are looking very carefully at all survey data and all the other information we extract from the financial markets. We see reasons to solemnly reaffirm that we will not allow any de‑anchoring of inflation expectations, which is very closely associated with our call for there to be no second-round effects to be observed. Inflation expectations and the delivery of price stability over time are totally dependent on the absence of these second-round effects in a period in which we have a hump in headline inflation. On the first question, as I said, we are capturing all the information available. As regards inflation expectations, we have a number of channels: we have the Survey of Professional Forecasters, we have other surveys and we have the financial markets. You referred to the financial markets. If I refer to the Survey of Professional Forecasters, we are at 1.9%, as we have been for a long period. As regards the information that we are extracting from the markets, you are absolutely right to say that we are observing a pick-up in an indicator that we consider very important to follow, which is the five-year break-even inflation rate five years ahead, because it captures very well the medium-to-long-term situation as regards expectations. But it is complex because a risk premium is also incorporated in the figures that you obtain when you extract the break-even inflation rate. So whether the observed pick up is reflecting or not something happening in the “pure” inflation expectations or whether there is an increase of this risk premium – which would not be surprising in the present period – is a complex issue. I would say at this stage that what we are observing would certainly reinforce our absolute determination to continue solidly anchoring inflation expectations. On the external value of the euro, I have said what I have to say. And I can only confirm to you that when we take our decisions, (there is nothing new there) we look at absolutely all parameters. The exchange rate is one of the parameters amongst many, many others that we look at when reaching conclusions on the inflation risk and on our capacity in the medium term to deliver price stability in line with our definition. With regard to your subtle last question, I have no advice for other central banks! I have noted since the beginning of the period of “turbulences” that we were all in different economies with various characteristics and with various instruments at our disposal, taking into account our own histories and our own structures. I take it that what has been done has been responsible and I think we could certainly prove that we – each of us, in our own environment – probably did what was required by the situation. In the Governing Council, we will continue to consider that we have a major responsibility, which is our primary goal in line with our mandate: to deliver price stability and to be credible – particularly in the eyes of our fellow citizens – in the delivery of price stability over the medium term. And that being ensured, we have to make sure that the money market in particular is in line with the monetary policy decisions that we would have taken in order to attain our primary goal. And this is what we have been doing since the start of the “turbulences”, which I would call a significant market correction, and of course, it is what we will continue to do. I have said, on behalf of the Governing Council, from the very beginning that we have our primary goal and everything that goes with it, and then that we also have our responsibility as regards the functioning of the money market independently of the primary goal and at the level of rates required by the primary goal. You know that I never respond to the question “How do you balance the risk for inflation on the one hand and the risk for growth on the other hand?” because we have only one needle in our compass, not two needles. Of course, you were right in saying that the risks to growth have their own impact on the risks to inflation. I have been very clear that the needle of our compass is inflation, and this needle signals risks. And I have said that our new information fully confirms the risks that we had identified. One of the reasons – as I have already explained – is that we will have a hump in headline inflation because there is a base effect as we had foreseen very clearly. And on top of that, we have an additional pick-up of prices of oil and commodities, which is very substantial as you can see, and also a pick-up in prices of agro products and food, processed food in particular, which again adds to the headline inflation. And that is the reason why, as I said, we will have quite a series of months with inflation being much above 2%. It is an immediate consequence of what we are observing, coming from these two areas in particular, on top of what has already been observed and explained. And, as I said, it will then progressively moderate next year. To the fellow citizens – and through you the Governing Council is talking to 320 million fellow citizens of the euro area – we say we will do what is necessary to deliver to you price stability in line with our definition in the medium term. So, we will have this impact of the big pick-up that we are observing in a number of prices, which are global prices, on top of everything else here in Europe, and we consider it to be our duty to ensure that this pick-up is transitory and that inflation falls back progressively to our definition of price stability. This is extremely important. In our own remarks, we also call upon absolutely all parties concerned to assume their responsibilities. This is not new. You have heard it from the Governing Council when we had previous oil shocks or new unexpected, sharp and abrupt increases of commodity prices or oil prices. It is extremely important that all parties concerned – and this means all social partners and all economic agents which have pricing power – assume their responsibilities. To your first question, I will not change anything in what I have already said. Second, we see, as I said, a number of reasons to have a hump: everything that we have previously observed, plus the most recent evolution of the price of oil and the most recent evolution of the price of food and processed food in particular and a large number of agro products. This puts us in a situation where the hump will probably be a little bit longer, and certainly bigger in terms of absolute magnitude, than what we would have had, had we not had to incorporate the two elements that I have mentioned. And the fact that headline inflation is higher than it should have been, had we not had this bad news, creates an additional element for which we have to be particularly alert as regards second-round effects. Certainly, our main message today would be: no second-round effects. As regards the alertness of the ECB, I think that nobody has any doubts about our alertness. As you know, the ECB takes pride in the fact that it has never pre-committed itself for a certain period of time by saying that we will not increase rates for any period of time or that we will do this or that for a number of months and so on. We have always said and we have never changed our concept in this respect: we are constantly alert. We always reserve at any time the right to move when we judge it to be necessary in order to counter the inflationary risk in the medium term. On the first point, I said that we were observing an ongoing process, and that process is under our eyes. We have the sentiment that it is a very significant market correction. The correction had been identified a long time ago as probably necessary, taking into account a number of phenomena that had been observed by the central bank constituency in particular, but not only by us: namely an underpricing of risks on a series of markets and for a large number of instruments. From that standpoint the sub-prime mortgage market has been emblematic. I would only say that we will observe and monitor all these developments on the financial markets very closely. I will not give you any date or embark on any kind of forecast for this phenomenon. You can perhaps extract the sentiment of the market itself as regards the future evolution of the present market anomalies. If you look at the three-month money market in particular, you can see the present views of the market participants as regards the progressive alleviation of the tensions and these can be observed on both sides of the Atlantic. I will not say any more than that. As regards our own monetary policy stance, we took a decision today, as we do at each of our meetings, based on what we judge to be appropriate in order to counter inflationary risks and to continue anchoring inflation expectations solidly. It is our mandate and we are constantly alert in that respect. As for our December forecast, we will have a rendez-vous at our next meeting and I will be able to explain it in detail. At this stage I do not think it would be reasonable for me to do so. I have said that the hump will be incorporated in our forecast, I would be very surprised if it were not the case, but I do not want to embark on any other remark at this stage. And on the euro, I have said all that I have to say on the exchange rate. First, with regard to the second question, if we do not have any second-round effects – which, fortunately, we have observed in the past, because we have already had to cope with sharp and abrupt increases in some global prices – then, after a period of around 12 months, these progressively disappear from the screen when calculating headline inflation. So in our analysis there should not be second-round effects. The cooling down or any kind of change in the evolution of the real economy itself as regards its own pace would have an impact of a different nature. You do not offset a short-term spike by means of a longer-term parameter. These are two different issues. We have to treat the spikes that we are observing in a number of prices as transitory phenomena and this is the reason why we have to prevent second round effects. Then we have to incorporate all pertinent medium-term observations regarding all the parameters that are relevant for inflation in order to define our own monetary policy stance, including of course the prevention of second-round effects. As for the figure of the hump I will not say anything at this stage. What is absolutely clear is that, because we had this additional element coming from agro-food products, processed food and oil, we have a figure, which at the level of the euro area as a whole, could be from 0.2% to 0.3% over and above the previous hump. I have already said that we should be conscious of the fact that there is a hump, which should be observed for a number of reasons. I do not want to confirm any figure at this stage, but it is absolutely clear that it will be significantly over 2%, for a number of months. And I expect that it will progressively moderate in the course of 2008. We should not see it as being permanent. It will be transitory and we will treat it as transitory by preventing second round effects. I am telling you that and, through you, our fellow citizens. As I often say, we live in a multi-dimensional world. You are absolutely right to say that, we are observing this phenomenon simultaneously on both the financial side and the monetary side of our analysis, where we have a number of very dynamic figures. The most dynamic figures are for the loans to non-financial corporations. When the situation was last observed in September, the figure stood at 14.1%, coming after 14.2% in the previous month. However, I have to say that – and everybody knows how complex it is – we would certainly not be credible if we were to say that it was clear cut and very simple. We say that the situation is complex and we have to analyse and disentangle all the phenomena that are behind it, including the re-intermediation in the banking sector that I mentioned in the Introductory Remarks. However, in my opinion, it does reinforce our own monetary policy concept, namely that what we are observing in the economic analysis is confirmed by what we are observing in the monetary analysis and vice versa. So, it is clear from the cross-checking that the risks are there. There is no doubt about that. On the first point, never forget that we are and have always been reasoning over the medium term. So in the medium term, we will deliver price stability in line with our definition, because it is our mandate, it is our duty, it is what has been called for by our democracies and it is also what the people of Europe are requesting very strongly, and they are right. So, again, my reasoning is that we will continue to deliver price stability in line with our definition. The hump is transitory. It is big, it is bigger than what was foreseen before, but we will ensure that it is transitory; we will not tolerate second-round effects and spiralling. On growth, I have already said that our baseline scenario has, at this stage, not been modified significantly; we consider that we would be around potential. We will see. There are risks, and they are risks that I have already mentioned. You had a second question on the liquidity injections: again, as I said, we ensure that money markets function as properly as possible; we did that in the past in a fashion that has been observed very carefully the world over. We will continue to do what is necessary, in line with our own decision as regards the main refinancing operations, which is at 4%. Let me only mention that today, in the Governing Council, we decided to renew the two supplementary longer-term refinancing operations – in our wording the LTROs – that had been allotted in August and in September (you will remember that there were two tranches), in order to further consolidate the progress that has been achieved so far in the normalisation of our euro money market. So we will have two new LTROs to be rolled over, each of EUR 60 billion. All details regarding dates and the way they will operate will be provided in a press release that you will receive at the end of this press conference. Certainly not unrealistic. It is our definition of price stability. We are credible in the delivery of price stability in the medium run and we have a transitory phenomenon. Full stop. On the exchange rates, I have no other comments than those I have already made. On the interventions, I never comment. On the present market correction I will not say anything as regards timing. As I said before, it is a significant market correction with episodes of overshooting, of high volatility and turbulent periods and it is an ongoing process that we are looking at very carefully. I will only say that we have observed a progressive appeasement of tensions in the money market, and we had a responsibility in this respect. If you extract information from the market, you can have a view that it will continue over 2008 progressively. So, that is an indication that you might have, and I will not comment on any particular provisioning of commercial banks. I always ask all commercial banks – all financial institutions – to be as transparent as possible and as responsible as possible. It is a message for private financial institutions; it is also a message for absolutely all parties concerned, whether private or public and whatever their responsibilities are in any kind of regulation or banking survey and institution survey in general. There will certainly be lessons to be learnt from this episode and I think that a good set of lessons to be learnt is to treat absolutely all parties concerned without putting aside any one of them, because we certainly have to improve the situation in this respect. I do not want to embark on a discussion of all items. Some are not moving at all, and I am very happy with that. Some are perhaps even decreasing in price, because of strong competition. But it is true that in that category in particular we see increases, for a number of reasons that are very much associated with the increasing prices of inputs. That being said, we are asking for competition to be as intense as possible in the euro area. We are not at the appropriate level in the economies concerned or at the level of the euro area in terms of having a real, totally fluid and highly competitive single market. That can be seen from a number of observations in various national economies in the euro area. So we are calling for full liberalisation of markets and, particularly in this domain, we certainly need to have more intense competition across the board in the euro area. This would be in the interests of consumers, in the interests of our fellow citizens. It would also be in the interest of sustainable growth and job creation and help to keep inflation as low as possible. We would all benefit from an increase in competition and the implementation of the appropriate structural reforms. This is one of the messages from the Governing Council for today. This is true at the level of each individual economy and, of course, at the level of Europe as a whole, particularly in this domain. Long question, short answer. No, we did not discuss this at the level of the Governing Council. "
2007-10-04,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference here in Vienna. I would like to thank Governor Liebscher for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting has confirmed that the outlook for price stability over the medium term is subject to upside risks. Against this background, and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our primary objective. The fundamentals of the euro area economy support a favourable medium-term outlook for economic activity. In particular, corporate earnings and profitability have been sustained, employment growth has been robust and unemployment has fallen. However, given the financial market volatility and the reappraisal of risk seen in recent weeks, this assessment is surrounded by heightened uncertainty. In view of the only limited range of new economic data that have become available since our meeting in early September, particular caution needs to be exercised when assessing any potential impact of the financial market developments on the real economy. Hence, it remains necessary to gather additional information and examine new data before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy focused on maintaining price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. On the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby favouring an environment conducive to sustained economic growth, well-functioning markets and job creation. Providing such an anchor for medium and long-term inflation expectations is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. On the basis of the available data, it appears that the sustained real economic growth experienced in the euro area in the first half of 2007 has continued through the summer. This is also reflected in available forecasts for real GDP growth for the third and fourth quarters of 2007. While financial market volatility appears to have contributed to a decline in euro area consumer and business confidence indicators in September, these indicators remain above their historical averages and continue to point to ongoing sustained growth during the second half of 2007. Looking further ahead, available forecasts for 2008 continue to confirm our main scenario of real GDP growing at around trend potential. This scenario is based on the expectation that global economic activity will remain robust, with the moderation of economic growth in the United States largely offset by the continued strength of emerging market economies. This will provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. Consumption growth in the euro area should also contribute to economic growth, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions remain supportive. That said, in view of the potential impact of increased financial market volatility and the re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the uncertainties surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic activity have increased. On balance, risks to the outlook for growth are judged to lie on the downside. These downside risks relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on confidence and financing conditions, concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances, as well as further oil and commodity price rises. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate increased strongly to 2.1% in September 2007, from 1.7% in August. As we have already indicated on previous occasions, we are now entering a period during which unfavourable effects from energy prices will have a strong impact on annual HICP inflation rates. Owing mainly to such effects, as a result of the marked decline in energy prices a year ago combined with the recent substantial increase in oil prices, we expect the inflation rate to remain significantly above 2% in the remaining months of 2007 and in early 2008, before moderating again. Largely as a consequence of capacity constraints and relatively tight labour market conditions, inflation is expected to be around 2% on average in 2008. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They continue to include the possibility of further increases in the prices of oil and agricultural products as well as additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. Taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments may occur, and an increase in the pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. Such developments would pose upward risks to price stability. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. A broad assessment of the monetary data supports the view that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. However, the August annual growth rate of close to 12% in the monetary aggregate M3 as well as the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations, which reached a record level of more than 14% in August, may have been influenced by a number of temporary or special factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve and the recent financial market volatility, and may therefore overstate the underlying rate of money and credit expansion. A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important during the current period of financial market volatility, as the latter may influence the short-term behaviour of private agents and thereby affect monetary developments. Thus, monetary and credit data can offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market volatility. Indeed, previous episodes of heightened financial market uncertainty have been associated with large portfolio shifts into safe and liquid monetary assets. For the time being, however, there is still little evidence in the monetary data for such shifts since the rise in financial market volatility in early August, while it cannot be excluded that the flow of bank loans to the non-financial corporate sector in August partly reflects the re-intermediation of some financing onto bank balance sheets. Further data will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market volatility on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. Overall, the continued vigour of underlying monetary and credit expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring so as to detect underlying trends on the one hand and to better understand shorter-term dynamics on the other. This will provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. To sum up, a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term, against the background of good economic fundamentals in the euro area. Accordingly, and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our primary objective. At the same time, given the heightened level of uncertainty, additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn. Consequently, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. On the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is all the more important in the current context. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Turning to fiscal policy, the Governing Council is increasingly concerned about a weakening in structural fiscal consolidation efforts and the delaying of decisive action to address fiscal imbalances. Against this background, all euro area countries concerned are urged to meet the commitments made in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact to structurally improve their fiscal balances. The commitment made in the Eurogroup to reach medium-term budgetary objectives in 2008 or 2009, and by 2010 at the latest, must also be respected by all euro area countries. Those countries that have already achieved sound fiscal positions need to abstain from pro-cyclical fiscal policies. Sound fiscal policies will also make an important contribution to maintaining confidence at a time of heightened uncertainty in financial markets. With regard to structural reforms, the Governing Council fully supports efforts to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster market flexibility. While the services sector is a particularly important area for reform, further efforts are also needed to improve the functioning of the agricultural markets. Against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices, further liberalisation and reforms in the EU agricultural markets would help to enhance their efficiency and benefit European consumers through lower prices. The successful conclusion of the Doha round of world trade negotiations should also help to improve the functioning of global trade in general and of agricultural markets in Europe and worldwide in particular. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * On your first question, I would say that firstly – as you know – when we take monetary policy decisions and when we meditate on the monetary policy stance, we take all parameters into account. I have always said that, so there is nothing new – we take into account all parameters. Exchange rates are one of the parameters to the extent that they influence risks to price stability. Secondly, exchange rates are a very important question which calls, in the opinion of the Governing Council, for verbal discipline, precisely because this is a very important question. And we have a methodology to address such a question. That methodology exists in Europe, and that methodology exists in the world. In Europe, we have the methodology of governments and executive branches having only one voice, otherwise there is total disorder. And we have a methodology as regards the world, which is the G7, where the meditation crystallises in a message and that message is signed by the central banks and executive branches concerned. So, again, verbal discipline for all parties concerned is a very important issue and we have the appropriate methodology. As I have said already on a number of occasions, we consider excessive volatility very counterproductive from the standpoint of global growth and for the growth of all components of the global economy. And I have already qualified what I could say on the dollar, on the yen and on the yuan, and I stick to what I have said. When I say that we appreciate what the Secretary of the Treasury and colleagues in the United States say about the strong dollar being important and favourable to the US economy, it means something. And, as you know, on the yen, I have already mentioned that the markets should progressively take into account the better fundamentals of the Japanese economy. And as far as the yuan and other currencies of emerging markets in Asia are concerned, the fact that more flexibility would be appropriate, both in their interest and in the interest of the global economy, is also something which is in our own message. And on the second point, I would say that I was clear in the diagnosis of the Governing Council that we consider that upside risks to price stability are on our radar screen. This is very important. I also mentioned that with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability. So it is clear that we have to continue to solidly anchor inflationary expectations. This is extremely important for the European economy. It is all the more important, as I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, as regards the present episode of market volatility. And by doing this, we are paving the way for price stability and therefore for growth and job creation. I have already responded to the question on the euro. So I stick to what I just said. I will take your last point first. We are observing on the money markets – and I would say that it is also a phenomenon very much in evidence across the Atlantic – that the three-month money market rates and the term money market interest rates in general are signalling tensions due to the preference for very short-term liquidity. This is the characteristic of the present market and we have seen that since the beginning of the tensions that occurred in August. It is also due to the clear wish of a number of commercial banks and financial institutions to retain their liquidity and not to embark on term lending. As you know, we have taken that into account ourselves through our own instruments in the recent past. Not only have we embarked on providing liquidity when needed in order to maintain rates in line with our decision on the interest rate for the main refinancing operation, namely 4%, but we have also embarked on additional tranches of long-term refinancing operations - in our jargon LTROs - in order to refinance on a three-months basis a more significant part of euro refinancing. We consider this to be the appropriate way to respond to the tensions that you mention, even if these tensions do not emanate from the money market itself. What I mean is that they are triggered by phenomena that are associated with corrections in a number of other markets in particular in the ABCP market. As regards your remark on some changes in the wording of the introductory statement, you know that no introductory statement reads exactly like the previous one. Otherwise, we would not be doing our job of capturing all the elements that appear to be important. We are very insistent on the fact that against this background our monetary policy stance is weighted to counter upside risks to price stability as it is required by our primary objective. I think it is important. We underline the fact, that we stand ready to counter the risks. We think that the risks are on the upside at the present moment, while, as I have already said, there are also uncertainties and we believe that we need more information to further analyse the situation. We look at the overall situation of the European economy and we analyse the risks to price stability, as well as the repercussions of the turbulence at global level on our own economy. So all of this will be discussed at the level of the G7, and we will make our own contribution to this discussion as usual. I never say in advance what the outcome of the G7 will be. The G7 is precisely there for us to discuss issues at a very high level, because it consists of the top levels of the executive branches, and the central bank governors, in order to be sure that we work out an appropriate diagnosis of the situation. That does not mean that we are not in touch permanently and certainly that we are not in touch in the constituency of central bankers. I understand that the question for Klaus was on hedge funds? Liebscher: I would like to stress that, as this is a press conference of the President of the ECB and the hedge fund issue is not really and purely an Austrian issue, I should like to hand over this question to him, because it is his press conference, and not mine. Let me just say that, with regard to hedge funds in particular and highly-leveraged institutions in general, a lot of very good work has been done by the Financial Stability Forum, in which Europeans are actively participating, in particular, the Vice-President, Lucas Papademos, and Mario Draghi, who holds the Chair of the Financial Stability Forum. A number of orientations have been worked out. As you might recall, these do not all assume that we would embark on the administrative regulation of these particular highly-leveraged institutions, but rather on a number of very important indirect moves with the full involvement of the core intermediaries, namely the prime brokers that are themselves under the jurisdiction of the banking surveillance authorities. It also calls specifically on the banking surveillance authorities to exercise maximum alertness as to whether or not the core intermediaries are doing their job correctly. It also calls for benchmarks for best behaviour to be set by the industry itself in order for the risk management of these institutions to be optimal and the transparency of the hedge funds and highly-leveraged institutions vis-à-vis both their core intermediaries and vis-à-vis their investors to follow best practices. The Governing Council of the ECB has always said that this was certainly very important. Now, taking into account all the new elements that have been observed in this recent period, I would say that we also need to reflect on the so-called conduits and so-called special vehicles, which are also non-regulated entities that might prove to be the source of risks. The lessons to be drawn from what has happened have yet to be worked out, but we can see a number of avenues where work should be done. I have to say that the work that has been done, in particular, by the ECB in the Financial Stability Review, but also by all the members of the Eurosystem and, at a global level, by other institutions contains a lot of very good orientations in this respect. Nevertheless, this work is in progress, and we have a lot to work on. First of all, the question on bank lending: please be informed that we will publish tomorrow – at 10 o’ clock – our report on the results of the October 2007 bank lending survey for the euro area. We have sped up the process considering that it was very useful in the present period of time. But I cannot provide you already now what will be published tomorrow. Nevertheless, at the present moment I can tell you that the results of this bank lending survey for October point to some net tightening of the credit standards on loans to households for house purchase and also, in particular, on loans to large enterprises in the third quarter of 2007. The tightening seems mainly to affect large transactions, such as loans granted to finance mergers and acquisitions. The net tightening follows a prolonged period where credit standards were either basically unchanged or eased. Looking forward, banks expect to tighten credit standards further in the fourth quarter of 2007. You will see that tomorrow, but I think it was useful for me to give you this information already now. As regards inflationary expectations: as you know we extract these inflationary expectations from a large number of tools – we utilise surveys, both our survey and the surveys done by outside institutions, and we also have the financial market’s information. I would say that, as far as the surveys are concerned, they are tilting a little to the upside, even if they remain in line with our definition of price stability – less than 2%. As regards the information that we extract from markets – and this is a phenomenon that we have now been observing for a little while – we see a tendency towards the upside. And this has to be well understood; to explain particularly these upside moves of the break even inflation, there are probably market elements, that are more or less associated with some kind of market corrections. But we have there information coming from the financial markets that we clearly have to take into account. As I said, the solid anchoring of inflation expectations is decisive: not only because it is our mandate, but also because it is essential for the prosperity of Europe. If market expectations weren’t correctly anchored, then all medium and long term market interest rates would go up, all things being equal, the financial environment of Europe would be less favourable, economic decisions would be less optimal and, taking everything into account, we would be in a less favourable situation as regards long-term sustainable growth and job creation. By the way, as far as job creation is concerned, let me tell you that the most current figures I have for the last eight and a half years since the setting up of the euro show that we have created close to 15 million jobs. As regards market expectations, I will merely say that, at the moment and everything taken into account, risks for price stability are on the upside. Upside risks are on our radar screen and, as always, we confirm that we stand ready to act whenever it is necessary in order to solidly anchor these inflation expectations and be in line with our primary mandate. And a question to Mr Liebscher, if I may – I believe this is correctly placed, because Vienna takes a particular interest in what goes on in Central and Eastern Europe and how that affects business here in Austria and in the euro zone – could you give us a sense of whether you believe that the financial market turbulence could have an effect on the euro zone via the avenue of trade and investment and financial flows with the newer Member States of the EU? As regards your first question I would only say, as I have already said, that not all of our introductory remarks are alike. At the present time, we think it appropriate to concentrate on the upside risks to price stability that we see, and to concentrate on the fact that we stand ready to counter these risks at any time. It is something that we consider important and we do not want to enter into a debate on whether or not, given the increase that has been observed in the term money market rates or what has been observed on the exchange market, one could describe the monetary policy stance differently. In any case, when there are risks to price stability which would threaten our delivery of price stability, even if we are not accommodative at all we might increase rates, and if we are accommodative we might not increase rates, because, again, what we have to do is to deliver price stability and be absolutely credible in the delivery of price stability. So, take our message as: (i) we confirm our baseline scenario as regards growth, (ii) we say that we have downside risks for that baseline scenario, and (iii) I will go back because it is your second question, we mentioned that with all this taken into account, we see upside risks to price stability, and we stand ready to counter these upside risks to price stability. But uncertainties are such that we need more information and data to further reflect on what and when it would be appropriate to counter these risks. As regards the real economy, again, we see downside risks, but at the present time we see uncertainties increasing. However, we confirm our baseline scenario. For all the reasons I have given it is true that we have had a relatively mixed indicator. In particular, for reasons that are obvious due to the turmoil, that a number of surveys are less flattering than they were before, but they are still relatively high, as I have mentioned. We have a labour market which has so far continued to be favourable – this is something very important and I have already mentioned some figures; we have, at the level of the euro area, retail sales that remain relatively favourable. Our staff projections are very close to what is being worked out by the other international institutions, having their own forecasts for the euro area economy. So, yes at this stage, our baseline scenario remains the main scenario whilst we fully accept that uncertainties have increased. But I would not say that we are certain that in all the cases currently observed we will have a significantly negative impact on the real economy. And, it is also very important for us to maintain confidence as much as possible, because confidence is the key ingredient at the moment. We are in a period of relative uncertainty. The European economy can count on us to maintain confidence. We will maintain the purchasing power of our fellow citizens, the 320 million fellow citizens that there will be as of 1 January next year. We will maintain confidence in the anchoring of inflation expectations. We will maintain confidence in the capacity to rely solidly on an economy which has anchors. On the last point, Klaus, maybe you would like to say a word? Liebscher: First of all, according to my information and as a result of the recent discussions I have had with one or another counterpart from one or another new Member State, I do not have the impression that the financial market turbulences have spilled over. Second, in general, the economic development in most of the new Member States is very good and is in part also improving the forecasts for real GDP growth. And, thirdly, taking that into consideration, I think that there should be, as the President has said, no reason why we should have severe or strong effects on our trade relations because trade with most of the new Member States is primarily export-led and, therefore, if they have good economic development, then our export situation should not be hampered by that. Thank you very much indeed, Klaus. On the first point, I have already responded twice, so let me sum up. We have not mentioned “accommodative”. If we would have liked to mention “appropriate” we would have done so, but we did not. If we would have wanted to say “neutral” we would have done that, but we did not. Again, our message is that there are upside risks to price stability and we stand ready to counter these upside risks, to solidly anchor inflation expectations, to deliver price stability, and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. As regards the money market, we acted when needed to permit the money market to function as well as possible, in line with our decisions as regards the interest rates for which we are responsible. I have to say that until now what we have been doing has been fully vindicated. We utilised instruments that existed; we did not invent any instruments. At this stage, we will continue to do what is, in our opinion, necessary to help the money market. We know that the reason why the money market is under tension on both sides of the Atlantic is not in our own jurisdiction. The tensions of the money markets are very much coming from this functioning of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) and of the commercial paper itself in a number of circumstances and from problems of refinancing of a number of entities like conduits, special vehicles and money market funds. This is a very complex situation. I am confident that all these tensions will be progressively surmounted, but at this stage we will continue to do what is appropriate in our view to help markets and I think that is well understood by market participants. We currently have an interest rate for the main refinancing operations of 4%. It is absolutely clear that we consider it our duty to act in such a way that the very short term money market rates are close to the level of the interest rate that we have set for our main refinancing operations. We constantly discuss such issues because they are very important. I would say that there is an ongoing meditation, not only at the level of the Governing Council, but also at the level of the staff of the Eurosystem, to see exactly what the situation is and to respond to a situation which is also objectively moving. So I will not mention any particular instrument that we might have discussed. I would only say that we continue to do what we believe is necessary in the circumstances. There was no particular discussion of the Governing Council on any particular point, although we are totally open in this meditation, which – as I said – is ongoing. As I have said since the very beginning, we have taken very seriously the tensions that have been observed. These tensions appeared in a very acute way on 9 August, and we acted immediately. Within an hour and a half, we had taken a decision. I will only say that we will continue to do what we consider important. To sum up again: our primary objective is price stability. We deliver and continue to deliver price stability and continue to solidly anchor inflation expectations. I explained in the introductory remarks that we would have a hump now in headline inflation. I have pre-announced that several times at such press briefings. You may remember that some were saying “you are at 1.7%, you are very low, you are below 2%”, but we have to look forward and looking forward, we knew that we would have a hump. We are now at the start of the hump. It will go up and then alleviate, even if for the full average of next year, we will be – according to our staff projections – at a level hovering around 2%. As regards the second responsibility that we have, independent of the first, it is to do whatever is necessary to keep our money market in good order. We know that the tensions are not coming from the money market itself. Otherwise we would have already solved all the problems on both sides of the Atlantic a number of weeks ago. We have to do whatever we judge necessary to continue to help the money market to function as well as possible. On the first question, on interventions, I never comment: so, no comment on your first question on interventions. On the second question, we do not balance the risks to the real economy and the risks to price stability to make a judgement of which risk is more important. That is not the way we proceed. We analyse the real economy and, as I said, on balance, the risks to the outlook for growth are judged to lie on the downside. I do not want to repeat the reasons why we judge that the risks lie on the downside. I said that our baseline scenario was clearly in line with what we have already said, in line with the previous projections, but the risks are on the downside. But our decisions on monetary policy are based on the risks to price stability. As I have very often said, we have a needle in our compass, and it is indicating the risks to price stability, because our duty, our primary objective, is to deliver price stability. And from that standpoint, we see – in contrast to what we have seen in the real economy – risks on the upside. I do not say that these risks have materialised. I say risks are on the upside. As regards your third question I will not comment on the quarterly results of various institutions. There are a number of them. If I may judge the reaction of the market, which of course has to be seen in a much longer perspective, some reactions were relatively positive. But again, I do not draw any conclusions from that. And it is an ongoing process: most European banks have not yet published their quarterly results. There is a slight difference of one month in the accounting procedures on both sides of the Atlantic for a number of institutions. So we will see. At this stage I will not comment further. Questions: A very short question. And again, it is just a little bit of help with the language that you used today. Can you tell us the difference between “you stand ready to act” versus “vigilance” or “strong vigilance”? How are we to interpret this difference? It is up to you to interpret. What is clear is that we are always alert. And we are never pre-committed, because we can always move when we judge that the risks to price stability command a move from us. I fully accept the fact that a number of observers have attributed a great signalling value to vigilance. I accept that there is, de facto, a great signalling value in the word “ vigilance”, although I always said – and we proved it in the last months – that it did not mean that there was a probability of 100% that we would do something, because I always accompany these words with “we are not pre-committed”. But I would not give signalling value to any other words that we use. I urge you to look at the introductory remarks in their entirety. Consider that it is our best appreciation and judgement of the situation at the level of the collége taking absolutely everything into account. We do not want to signal very subtle messages for you to prejudge what we might do. It would be the wrong interpretation. I accept that the word “vigilance” is special in that respect, even if it does not mean a pre-commitment, but for the rest, please look at the entirety of what we say. Consider that it is the result of an assessment of the situation which is carried out in a collegial manner. We are living in a multi-dimensional world, and we try to capture the complexity of this multi-dimensional world. If we wanted to communicate more simply, I could say at the next meeting that the probability that we increase rates is x%, the probability that we leave rates unchanged is y% and so forth, but that is not the way we operate. Let’s say that you have there our best appreciation of a multi-dimensional, complex situation. I already said all I had to say about the euro. Thank you for your attention. "
2007-09-06,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting has confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks, as identified by both our economic and monetary analyses. Incoming macroeconomic data also confirm the strong fundamentals of the euro area economy and support a favourable medium-term outlook for real GDP growth. Against this background, our monetary policy stance is still on the accommodative side with, inter alia, money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area. At the same time, the financial market volatility and reappraisal of risk of recent weeks have led to an increase in uncertainty. Given this high level of uncertainty, it is appropriate to gather additional information and to examine new data before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy aimed at delivering price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. On the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. This is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. All in all, the data available suggest that economic activity in the euro area is continuing to expand at sustained rates. Euro area real GDP growth in the second quarter moderated to 0.3% quarter on quarter, compared with 0.7% in the previous quarter. However, due account should be taken of the volatility of these growth rates. Accordingly, economic growth during the first half of 2007, as a whole, was in line with potential growth. Data on activity in the third quarter – from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates – remain favourable overall and support the assessment that real GDP is growing at sustained rates. In particular, the latest data on unemployment are favourable and the levels of all confidence indicators to August were high. Global economic activity is expected to remain robust, as the likely slowdown in the United States is expected to be largely offset by the continued strong growth in emerging markets. This will continue to provide support to euro area exports and investment. In addition, consumption growth in the euro area should strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions improve further. That said, in view of the overall potential impact of increased financial market volatility and the re-pricing of risk on the real economy, appropriate monitoring of the economy’s evolution is necessary. This outlook is also reflected in the September 2007 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which for the first time include Cyprus and Malta. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.2% and 2.8% in 2007, and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. In comparison with the June Eurosystem staff projections, the range projected for real GDP growth in 2007 has been revised slightly downwards, mainly reflecting the assumptions of somewhat higher oil prices and slightly tighter market financing conditions due to higher average risk premia. In the view of the Governing Council, the ranges presented serve as a good reminder of the general uncertainty surrounding economic projections, which it is worthwhile emphasising given the current volatility in the financial markets. The risks to these projections for economic growth are judged to lie on the downside. These downside risks relate mainly to a potentially broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets, global imbalances and protectionist pressures, as well as further oil and commodity price rises. With respect to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in August 2007, the same rate as in the previous month. However, over the remainder of this year, inflation rates are likely to increase again to above 2%. In the September 2007 ECB staff projections, annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.9% and 2.1% in 2007, and between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2008. In 2008, a declining impact from indirect taxes and energy prices is expected to be compensated by higher pressures from unit labour costs. Compared with the June 2007 Eurosystem staff projections, the new ranges for 2007 and 2008 are within the ranges previously projected. The Governing Council is of the view that risks to this outlook for price developments lie on the upside. These upside risks include increases in indirect taxes beyond those anticipated thus far and further increases in oil prices and prices for agricultural products. More fundamentally, stronger than expected wage developments and an increase in the pricing power in market segments with low competition may occur. Such developments would pose upside risks to price stability. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. The potential materialisation of these risks – or their abatement – requires close monitoring. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. On the basis of the latest available data (covering the period to the end of July), the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion remains strong. This is reflected in the rapid growth of the broad monetary aggregate, M3, which grew at an annual rate of 11.7% in July, and the strength of MFI loans to the private sector, which continue to increase at double-digit rates on an annual basis. When identifying and assessing the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary expansion, it is important to look through short-term volatility and the impact of temporary factors on developments in specific monetary aggregates. Taking the appropriate broader and medium-term-oriented perspective, there are several indications that increases in short-term interest rates over recent quarters have influenced monetary developments. For example, increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more modest expansion of M1, as the opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of M3 has increased. Moreover, higher short-term rates have led to some stabilisation in the growth of MFI credit to the private sector, albeit at double-digit annual rates, with the growth of household borrowing moderating as house price dynamics and real estate activity have slowed. However, these developments are yet to dampen the overall rate of monetary expansion, as the flattening of the yield curve has increased the attractiveness of monetary assets relative to less liquid longer-maturity instruments, thereby causing broad money growth to rise. Furthermore, the growth of loans to non-financial companies has shown renewed vigour in recent months. In the current situation, let me remind you that volatility in financial markets can temporarily exert considerable influence over monetary dynamics. In previous episodes, private sector perceptions of and attitudes towards risk, and the resulting portfolio behaviour, have strongly affected monetary developments. The monetary data for July may already have been partly influenced by such portfolio considerations and this could possibly apply even more to the August data to be released later in September. However, as has been demonstrated in the past, an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the monetary data can help in our understanding of the impact of financial developments on monetary developments and to extract the policy-relevant signal in monetary growth with regard to longer-term inflationary trends. In such circumstances, the broad-based approach adopted in the ECB’s monetary analysis is at a premium. Overall, the continued vigour of underlying monetary and credit expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring. To sum up, a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term – against the background of the strong fundamentals of the euro area economy. Accordingly, our monetary policy stance is still on the accommodative side with, inter alia, money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area. At the same time, given the high level of uncertainty, additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. On the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. In the current context, it is all the more important that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. In the area of fiscal policy, progress in structural fiscal consolidation remains slow and there are risks that some countries will pursue expansionary pro-cyclical fiscal policies. For the execution of 2007 budgets and the planning of 2008 budgets, it is crucial that the mistakes made during the previous economic upswing of 1999-2000 are not repeated. At present, countries with fiscal imbalances need to correct them in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. The commitment in the Eurogroup to reach medium-term budgetary objectives in 2008 or 2009, and by 2010 at the latest, has to be respected by all euro area member countries. Those countries that have already achieved sound fiscal positions need to abstain from pro-cyclical fiscal policies. Turning to structural reform, the Governing Council welcomes further efforts to increase the productive capacity of the euro area through higher employment. Euro area labour markets have shown clear signs of progress in the last few years, partly reflecting the impact of past labour market reforms. Further progress is needed, however, to enhance occupational and geographical labour mobility and skill creation, so as to overcome the comparatively low rates of labour market participation and still high unemployment rates in some countries and regions. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * First, the decision taken today was unanimous. Second, I would say that you have noted that I did not say the words “strong vigilance”, and I don’t want to comment any further on that. It is up to you, observers and the market to make your own judgement on the overall statement I have just given on behalf of the Governing Council. And third, as you know, we do not compare the risks to price stability with the risks to the economy, and we don’t weigh these risks against each other. We judge the risks for the economy to the extent that they have a bearing on the risks to price stability, because the needle of our compass is always price stability; and the anchoring of inflation expectations is always the most important thing for us, because it’s what our primary mandate calls for – price stability and credibility in the delivery of price stability over time. What counts as far as decisions on the monetary policy stance are concerned is our judgement regarding price stability. The important issue is the fact that we have on the one hand our primary mandate, the delivery of price stability, credibility in the delivery of price stability over time, and the solid anchoring of inflation expectations, and on the other hand we have to care for the proper functioning of the money market. We would say that we have both responsibilities. We must be credible in the delivery of price stability over time – and as I said, on behalf of the Governing Council, this is all the more important in a period of market volatility, because it provides markets with a solid anchor for all expectations in the medium term. It is a crucial part of our responsibility in this present episode to continue being extraordinarily attentive to the solid anchoring of inflation expectations. And separately we have to help ensure the correct functioning of the money market. The market has to function. We helped it to function, you will remember, in an expeditious and, I must say, successful fashion when we had to cope with the dislocation of the money market on 9 August. We conducted a number of quick tenders; we conducted an exceptional operation as regards the LTRO, the three-month refinancing operation. Yesterday we announced a quick tender, and today we displayed the results of this quick tender. This is, again, an important responsibility that we have. We must ensure that the money market functions in an appropriate fashion. But we don’t mix the two responsibilities. We have the two responsibilities, and they have to be fully accepted, but they do not influence one another. That is absolutely clear. As regards other decisions taken in the Governing Council concerning the money market, I have to mention – and you will have a press release at the end of this press conference – that the Governing Council has decided to launch a supplementary longer-term refinancing operation, the details of which will be given in a few minutes. It will be carried out as a variable rate tender, with no preset allotment amount, and we will apply the standard tender procedure. Again, we are living up to our responsibility vis-à-vis the functioning of the money market – and I’m proud of that. I have to say, I am proud of everything that we have done vis-à-vis the money market and the expeditious way in which we have taken decisions whenever and wherever appropriate. And again, this should not to be linked with the monetary policy stance; these are two different things. We did not discuss at all the last point that you mentioned. As regards the monetary policy stance, I have expressed the view of the Governing Council. There are, in our view, upside risks to price stability, and on the other hand we have noted a number of uncertainties, and this has led us to take the decision announced today. Again, let us not confuse the appropriate functioning of the money market and the monetary policy stance. I would say that, at whatever price, at whatever level of interest rates, the market has to function. And it is very important to make a clear separation between those two factors. Second, and this is clear in the eyes of the ECB as well as in the eyes of the Fed – even though I do not want to speak on behalf of the Fed – in the eyes of all of my central banking colleagues: for quite a long period of time we had said that we were diagnosing a level of risk appreciation in global finance that was signalling under-appreciation of risks in general, which was illustrated in particular, but not exclusively, by the low level of spreads, the low level of risk premia and the low level of volatility in a number of markets. So this diagnosis was clear. I could myself find first pages of financial papers in which I had expressed that opinion, and it was very much the opinion of the central bank constituency. So, in what is observed today, there are elements of correction that were diagnosed before the correction took place and, as is very often the case in such circumstances, there are hectic episodes in this correction, there is a level of volatility that can be quite high and there is also a large deal of overshooting. Again, we have to play a very important role in the central bank constituency, in both having the preoccupation of the medium and long-term solid anchoring of inflation expectations, and having a good understanding of what the pertinent trends are in the medium and long-term, of the global economy and of each particular economy; and, on the other hand, having to care for the appropriate functioning of the money market. The long-term, the medium-to-long-term responsibility has to be fully assumed, and we have also, at whatever level of interest rates we are deciding to meet our medium-term goal, to help the money market to function. On market expectations: your comments today I guess pushed out expectations as to whether the next increase in interest rates might not be for a couple of months, maybe towards the end of the year. Would you say that is a reasonable interpretation of your remarks today? And secondly, I wonder if I could ask you a more general question about your diagnosis of what has been happening in the last few months, whether the events we have seen in credit markets and money markets, and in the banking sector, reflect something that central banks can tackle through the market operations that you have been conducting and which you are obviously proud of today, or whether there is a deeper problem that has to be addressed, a confidence problem, something that is going to feed through into a more macroeconomic impact. I wonder whether you could just give us a diagnosis of how you see the events of the past few weeks and what they actually mean for the macroeconomy. On your first question: in what I said on behalf of the Governing Council, I was very clear on the fact that, for us, risks to price stability are on the upside, that in our baseline scenario we will certainly have to consider that those risks are on the upside. I also said that we were in a period of increased uncertainty, which is associated with all the observations we have made since 2 August, but our baseline scenario, our main assumption, remains that the real economy in Europe will behave properly. That is our main assumption, but we fully accept that the level of uncertainty has augmented in a significant fashion. And with all of this taken into account, again, we will follow the situation very closely. It is perhaps a little bit early to draw definitive conclusions from what we have observed. But first of all I repeat that I am very proud of the ECB and of the capacity of the ECB to face up to exceptional circumstances in a responsible and expeditious fashion. On a certain Thursday morning – 9 August – we had in front of us the dislocation of the money market; we were able to respond in real time. And that reminds me of what we did before. I always said this institution had proved in the past that it had the capacity to be wise in its diagnosis and expeditious in its action. And we continue to prove that, and we have proven that today: I have told you what has been decided today. As you mentioned yourself, the functioning of the market, particularly the money market and the commercial paper market, the ABCP market – as regards the short-term segment of the market, the one-month, two-month and three-month segments – is significantly hampered by an absence of confidence, an absence of confidence between the various economic agents and financial agents that are concerned, investors and savers. It is a problem we see in a large array of segments of the money market, and a provisional conclusion I would draw from that situation is that once again – but it is an observation I could make each time we had an episode of very excessive volatility in the market – transparency is of the essence. What we are observing is that a large number of institutions, agents, investors, savers, are displaying attitudes of fear and of an absence of confidence which are probably due to a large extent to an absence of sufficient transparency. For instance, an absence of sufficient transparency as regards the risks that have been taken by institutions, as regards the very nature of the various assets that are backing commercial papers. I would myself call for increased transparency across the board as part of what we should probably do. But again, I am prudent and cautious, and we have to be sure that we draw all the appropriate conclusions with the benefit of hindsight. Let me only remind you that after the Asian crisis we drew the same conclusion: the absence of sufficient transparency had driven a number of investors and market participants to consider that each particular issuer in Asia was to be treated with great caution and fear, because they were not sure of the accuracy of the information and data which were displayed. The international community drew the conclusion that it was necessary to increase transparency as regards monetary policy, fiscal policy and the level of reserve assets in these emerging markets. And it worked, in my opinion, pretty efficiently. So again, it is a lesson that we learnt in the past. We will see what conclusion we will draw now. It has to be drawn at a global level, of course. And we will certainly discuss that with our colleagues in the near future. On the first question: we are communicating in acting. As far as the money market is concerned, you could see what we have done and decided since 9 August and even today. I will not comment on a number of other issues. If we decide something, we will communicate the decision. At this stage, the overall level of collateral that we see seems to be sufficiently comfortable. But again, if we take any decision, you will be informed. As regards the usual discussion on whether or not more regulation is appropriate, you know that we have ourselves a preference for what can be done on the basis of a voluntary benchmark of good behaviour, voluntary code of conduct, voluntary principles. And I remain of the opinion that it is really of the essence that the industry itself work out its own benchmark and its own code of appropriate behaviour. But, of course, if the industry is not able to do that and if the voluntary working out of the industry does not permit an appropriate level of financial stability, then we certainly will have to do more. In any case, we need more transparency. The illustration that we have in front of our eyes as regards the functioning of commercial papers, asset-backed commercial papers in particular, is clearly that we presently pay a high price for the lack of transparency. And the same in the interbank money market, as I said. On the first point, I think we are absolutely clear in the Governing Council. We consider that we have to gather additional information, to examine new data, before being able to draw further conclusions for monetary policy. I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council the fact that we presently have a high level of uncertainty. I also mentioned, and this is very important, that the anchoring of inflation expectations is all the more important in a period of volatility of financial markets, of volatility of global financial markets, because it provides for all agents, investors, savers, in Europe and in the world a solid base for their medium-term and long-term decisions. This is the reason why we have to meet our responsibility. As I said, on both sides, we have to meet our responsibility in the anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations and meet our responsibility as regards the functioning of the market at whatever level of interest rates. As regards our message for fiscal policies, we say very clearly: all countries which are members of the Eurogroup must stick to the decision which was taken in Berlin – all countries, of course, without any exception. And this decision in Berlin called for the medium-term objective to be met at the latest in 2010. As I have said, it is too early to draw a definitive conclusion from the episode that we are experiencing, and don’t forget that I think we are presently in a period of high uncertainty. It is possible that, with the benefit of hindsight, we would say that this has been an episode of correction of the pricing of risks in the global economy and in global finance, and that we have finally been through a hectic period, including episodes of overshooting and intense volatility; but that has driven us to a better appreciation of risk and risk premia, both in general and in terms of global finance, making global finance healthier and global economic growth more sustainable in the long run. But, on the other hand, we cannot exclude that the present episode would appear to include elements that would have a serious bearing on the real economy. We cannot exclude anything at this stage. That said, we will have to draw lessons in all areas, the surveillance authorities, the level of vigilance of the financial institutions themselves and the risk management within the financial institutions. We will have to look at the functioning of the market in general and question the very rapid expansion of derivatives, structured products, CDOs and ABCP. We need to have a better understanding of what has driven this very rapid expansion. We will therefore have to think about this again, and it might be appropriate to draw lessons in transparency from what we are observing now. We have the rating agencies, and again we should look methodically at all the components of global finance and our own financial system. I would not be too hasty in drawing my own conclusions and I certainly would not start to look for scapegoats. We all have to ensure a better functioning of this very complex system. But again, if I had to specify one thing which I think is appropriate at the present time, it would be increased and improved transparency. I would say exactly what I have already said. We have two responsibilities. If we were to tell the market that the short-term considerations are now such that we are hampering our medium-term responsibility, then we would not improve the situation, but make it worse. As I said, the dis-anchoring of inflation expectations would probably be the worst thing that we could do in the present circumstances. We therefore have to live up to our Treaty responsibility – our mandate – and continue to solidly anchor inflation expectations. This is necessary for paving the way for appropriate sustainable growth and job creation, which is also essential as an element of confidence in the present circumstances, but we also have to continue doing what we have been doing, namely responding wisely, quickly, expeditiously and professionally to the challenges we face as regards the functioning of the money market, something I believe we have done well and will continue to do. No. The liquidity needs are very volatile in the present period. But we have a level of 4% for our main refinancing operation and we will take care that this level is reflected in the market. Of course, the short-term interest rates in the market can go up and down, but we have set a level of 4 % for our MRO and we will care for a normal functioning taking into account this level. I would only say that in the present episode, as in all previous such episodes, we have been in close contact with our friends, in particular on the other side of the Atlantic, on the other side of the Channel and on the other side of the Pacific. It has functioned, as it always functions, in a very simple, confident fashion. So, we have been in permanent contact. We are independent. We are independent because the Treaty calls upon us to be independent. By the way, the Treaty calls upon all executive branches in Europe not to seek to influence the central bank: Article 108 of the Treaty. The world over, nobody thinks that we could be influenced. But those who are claiming that they are influencing us are placing themselves outside the Maastricht Treaty. And I draw your attention to the fact that it is very telling to read Article 108. That being said, we take our decision, and we took today’s decision, unanimously, on the basis of our own analysis and on the basis of the various arguments that I just explained to you a moment ago. And we will continue to do that. And if such calls that are contrary to the provisions of the Treaty were to have any influence, it would be in the reverse direction, for obvious reasons. But it is not the case, precisely because everybody knows that we are fiercely independent and that there is not the slightest doubt that we decide in this totally independent way. If we were not deemed by the market to be totally independent, I draw your attention to the question of what market interest rates would be for bonds issued on a 50-year basis. Some governments are borrowing through 50-year bonds. If the signature of government A, B or C was substituted for our own ECB signature as regards the credibility of the currency, I let you draw your own conclusions in terms of market interest rates on a 50-year basis. We are deemed by the market to be able to deliver price stability during the next 50 years. And it is because we are deemed to be able to do that that the market interest rates have a low level taking into account our credibility, this level of credibility. So thank you again for your question. I will only signal that what we have been doing until now is to be able to decide, in a very expeditious and responsible fashion, to use quick tenders, utilising a weapon that we have, which we have utilised before. We have decided now twice to utilise another instrument that we have, which is the three-month refinancing operation. We think that these instruments are efficient, these instruments are suitable to be used any time there is a need. This is what we have been doing, and it is what we will continue to do. As you know, in the constituency of central banking, we don’t embark on giving good advice to colleagues. We consider that each of us has its responsibility; we are speaking of central banks that have major responsibilities. I have full confidence in the monetary policy committee of the central bank of Japan and in Governor Fukui to take the decision which is appropriate, taking everything into consideration. As regards the frequency of our contacts, which were phone contacts, I would say we were frequently in contact. Don’t forget that the trigger of these problems came from the sub-prime mortgage market – it came from across the Atlantic. Perhaps I have been in touch with Ben something like five or six times during the period; with Governor Fukui a little less, because we had perhaps fewer exchanges of views to make, but nevertheless frequent contact. It is the mark of the present period. We are all calling one another by our first name; we all have a very close relationship, a high level of mutual confidence and it is certainly part of the present world, a reassuring component of the present world that the network of central bankers is functioning very well. If and when the time comes, I will utilise the words “strong vigilance” of course. But as for the particular words that were utilised on 2 August, I would like you to go back to what I said on 2 August in the press briefing. I said: “…strong vigilance is therefore of the essence to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise”. I also said “Let me also stress that we never pre-commit, we decide at the moment of the meeting of the Governing Council on the basis of the information that we have, facts and figures, and according to the judgement that we make at that moment. I re-emphasise that we never pre-commit.” I said that, thinking about what I could say today, because I was addressing the next Governing Council. I also said: “Let me also say that we are experiencing a period of market nervousness, a period where we see volatility in markets in general and re-appreciation of risks… We will continue to pay great attention to the developments in the market…” It was a very short introductory remark to this press briefing and you have everything there. But again, certainly, we can utilise the expression “strong vigilance” in the future. On your first question, which is a good question, and I think permits me to provide clarification: For reasons that are manifold, the Eurosystem has a relationship with the commercial banks which is such that the level of refinancing operations is very large in comparison with a number of other central banks, and in particular, I have to say, in comparison with the US Fed. It is due, crucially, to the fact that the outright portfolio that is in the balance sheet of the Fed is significantly bigger than ours. So in normal times the order of magnitude of our outstanding refinancing operations, and of course, it is only an order of magnitude, because it depends very much on the analysis of the liquidity need, it could be something like €400 billion. That would be something which would be normal for us; it could be more, it could be less, but it is an order of magnitude. In the United States it is about one tenth of that, so you might be surprised when you compare the figures, but they are not comparable. I have to add that on top of this difference in the outright portfolio you have also the reserve requirements which we have and which are also contributing to this difference in the order of magnitude. As regards what I would call the present episode of market correction, with its hectic episodes, elements of overshooting and increased volatility, I would say we have to be pragmatic, as realistic as possible, and we have to do our job as well as possible. I think that the main ingredient which is lacking is confidence. Of course, anything that can improve confidence on our side by again continuing to anchor solidly expectations in the medium run and by meeting our responsibility in the money market is of extreme importance, but we have to work to improve confidence in general. I think it is our duty and we will continue, calmly, but resolutely, to help to restore confidence. I also said before, twice, in front of you, that keeping one’s composure was the rule of the game in periods that are difficult. Obviously, it is certainly the rule for public authorities, for central banks. It is, of course, very essential for the various institutions, financial institutions, private financial institutions concerned and I think that if we can all maintain the necessary composure and sangfroid in the circumstances, we will facilitate the return to confidence, which is of the essence. Thank you for your attention. "
2007-08-02,Trichet,"Let me just say a few words and then I will be ready to respond to questions, as usual. Recent economic developments and survey indicators confirm that sustained economic growth continued in the euro area through the second quarter. Rising oil prices, emerging capacity constraints and the potential for stronger wage and cost dynamics, among other factors, imply upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The existence of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons is confirmed by the strength of the underlying rate of monetary expansion: strong vigilance is therefore of the essence to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Both, our previous economic and monetary analysis as expressed in particular in the last press conference have been fully confirmed by the ongoing information we have received since the last meeting of the Governing Council. Let me also stress that we never pre-commit, we decide at the moment of the meeting of the Governing Council on the basis of the information that we have, facts and figures, and according to the judgement that we make at that moment. I re-emphasise that we never pre-commit. Let me also say that we are experiencing a period of market nervousness, a period where we see volatility in markets in general and re-appreciation of risks. We think that these developments in financial markets deserve attention. Shifts in market sentiment need careful monitoring. We will continue to pay great attention to the developments in the market over the period to come. I am now open to questions. On the first question, I do not ask for any new interpretation of the words I have pronounced. They have exactly the same meaning as before. I have always said when using the words “strong vigilance”, do not forget that we never pre-commit. There is nothing new there. On the second point, I told you and colleagues that are here that we thought at the level of the Governing Council, and also in the constituency of central bankers at a global level, that there had been in the past a degree of under-pricing of risks, some under-assessment of risks. And I said that at a moment when there was no particular turbulence on the market, but it was our judgement, our collegial appreciation. In the present episode, we see a process of re-appreciation of risks in general. And I would qualify this episode as a process of re-appreciation of risks which can be interpreted as a phenomenon of normalisation of risk pricing in a number of markets. We will follow this evolution very carefully. I said a number of weeks or months ago – and I said it repeatedly – that we were calling for an orderly and smooth re-appreciation of risks. We asked market participants and investors to be as keen as possible to avoid sharp and abrupt corrections. Now let me turn to your third question. The information we are giving at the moment is very much in the minds of a very large number of observers, economists and market participants. And I trust that what we are doing is to pave the way for economic growth to be as sustainable as everybody hopes. We have good news in the real economy. You gave a lot of attention to the fact that the IMF had revised up global growth and euro area growth. A lot of attention was also given to the fact that our unemployment rate in the euro area is now at the lowest level since 26 years, so this is something which is substantial. It is our duty to preserve stability, to anchor inflationary expectations, and through that mean, to permit sustainable growth to continue as everybody expects it will do. This is the way we are contributing to sustainable growth. On the first question, I will stick to what I said. We are in an episode where prices that were under-assessing an element of risk in a number of markets are normalising. I will not give any other qualification to the situation: it is a process of normalisation. The first quality to be demonstrated in circumstances when we see significant increases in measures of volatility in a large range of markets and asset classes by market participants and investors, and of course by authorities is to keep their composure. That is something important and it would permit the evolution of the market to be as effective as possible in terms of going back to a normal assessment of risks in general. As regards medium-term future interest rates after September, I will say absolutely nothing. My message today is a message of strong vigilance without forgetting that we never pre-commit. Beyond that, I will say absolutely nothing. We will assess the situation and judge on the basis of facts and figures and the development of the situation. I will tell you that when the time comes in September, after our decision, in the press conference. I would only speak about the figures that were published and to which I alluded in my brief words at the very beginning. Drawing on the figures we have on the monetary analysis side of the two pillars, loans to the private sector grew at a rate of 10.8% in June, a little bit more than in May, and loans to non-financial corporations at 13.3% in June, against 12.8% in May. M3, as you know, is very dynamic. So we are in a universe which is characterised by a continuation of the observation that we had made before. On your first question, I will only repeat that keeping one’s composure is important in any circumstances, but certainly in circumstances of market nervousness, as is the case presently. As for the second question, I will say how I qualify the situation at our next press conference. Today I have said that we are in a situation which in our opinion calls for strong vigilance, and that our previous diagnosis has been fully confirmed. On the third question, I would say that we have had absolutely no change in our own methodology and way of assessing the situation and expressing views. I will stick to what my colleague Axel Weber has said on this particular case and what has been said since last Monday. I will not add anything to that. At this stage I have no other comment that the rule of the Treaty must be respected fully in all circumstances. On the basis of very recent news that has come we will analyse the situation very, very carefully. But I repeat: the rule of the Treaty must be fully respected. And this calls for a very rapid and precise examination of what is at stake. We had exactly the same kind of methodology as we had before. I convey this message and this word on behalf of the Governing Council. Our decision today was not to change interest rates. And we always look at all parameters without any exception in taking our decision, without giving this particular parameter that you have mentioned more than its share in our overall assessment. This is not a press conference, this is a press briefing; and we are very keen to issue information not anonymously but publicly as frequently and as soon as it is necessary because, as you know, we have a policy of communicating only publicly. All other communications are null and void and are made on the basis of something which is not in line with the decision of the Governing Council. That being said, we constantly reflect on what we could do in order to be as efficient as possible in terms of our relationship with you. Let me add that it was worth having this press briefing also in view of how many of you did come. On the particular issue that you have mentioned, I will not add anything to what has been said by the German entities concerned themselves, by the authorities and by Axel Weber. On the overall assessment of the situation on the markets, I feel that we are observing a reassessment of risks. I mentioned already what our judgement was some time ago and, again, I see a phenomenon of normalisation of the assessment and pricing of risks. I also said that, in circumstances that are characterised by increasing volatility and by the reassessment of a number of risks in a number of markets, it was important that the market participants, investors and authorities, keep their composure, maintain their “sangfroid”. "
2007-07-05,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in June. It has also confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks. Given the positive economic environment in the euro area, our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side, with overall financing conditions favourable, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample. Looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest data and survey releases have remained broadly positive, supporting the view that economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of 2007 continued to expand at solid rates in line with our baseline scenario. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. The conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate. As regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust. External conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from overall financing conditions which remain favourable, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, balance sheet restructuring as well as business efficiency gains achieved over an extended period. Meanwhile, consumption should be supported by developments in real disposable income, as labour market conditions continue to improve. The risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At medium to longer horizons, the balance of risks remains on the downside, owing mainly to external factors. These relate in particular to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices, concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and potential shifts in financial market sentiment. As regards price developments, as reflected in Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in June 2007, unchanged from previous months. Looking ahead, the short-term profile of annual inflation rates continues to be determined largely by current and past energy price developments, as last year’s volatility in energy prices leads to significant base effects. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, which show an upward slope, annual inflation rates are likely to fall only slightly in the months ahead before rising again significantly towards the end of the year. At the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, risks to the outlook for price stability remain on the upside. These risks relate notably to the domestic side. In particular, as capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is high and labour markets continue to improve, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments. In addition, pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment. Such developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. Wage agreements in particular should be sufficiently differentiated to take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and sector-specific productivity developments. The Governing Council stresses the importance of avoiding wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. In addition, upside risks to price stability arise from increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those anticipated thus far, and the potentially procyclical stance of fiscal policy in some countries. Finally, on the external side, upside risks stem from the possibility of further unexpected oil price rises. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. The underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. The ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the continued rapid growth of M3, which increased at an annual rate of 10.7% in May, as well as the still high level of credit growth. The strong rate of monetary and credit expansion reflects, in part, favourable financing conditions and solid economic growth. When identifying and assessing the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary and credit expansion, it is important to look through shorter-term volatility and the effects of changes in the slope of the yield curve and external factors that are likely to prove temporary. Taking this perspective, there are several indications that higher short-term interest rates are now influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion. For example, increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more moderate expansion of the narrow aggregate, M1, in recent quarters. Equally, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006, albeit at double-digit levels. The stabilisation of loan growth is now becoming more broad-based, and is apparent in borrowing by both non-financial corporations and households. In the latter case, the stabilisation of loan growth also reflects some moderation in house price dynamics, although house price growth nonetheless remains at high levels on average in the euro area. Given the continued vigour of money and credit expansion, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample. In this environment, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any short-term volatility in inflation rates. The relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to the domestic side. As capacity utilisation is high and labour markets continue to improve, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage and profit margin developments. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. As regards fiscal policy, the Governing Council notes with concern the pressures emerging in a number of countries to relax previous fiscal consolidation targets. In the current overall benign economic environment, it is imperative that all governments comply with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal consolidation in economic “good times” and that all the countries concerned honour the commitments they made at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April 2007. As agreed in Berlin, taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area countries to achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest. These pledges should be reflected in the 2008 budget plans so as to avoid repeating governments’ past failure to adjust fiscal balances in economic “good times”. At the same time, the Governing Council welcomes the emphasis placed by the ECOFIN Council on measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council fully supports all measures that improve the functioning of product, labour and financial markets. In the context of the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs, the EU Member States noted that a well-functioning Internal Market remains at the heart of the Lisbon agenda and that its four freedoms will reinforce the European Union’s competitiveness. The completion of the Single Market is therefore a priority for Member States, in particular as regards further financial market integration, the pursuit of effective competition in the energy market and the implementation of the Services Directive. Increased market competition and a reduction of cross-border barriers are beneficial for consumers since they lead to lower prices and a greater choice of products. For firms, they lead to higher efficiency, greater dynamism and an enhanced capacity to cope with economic shocks and to face the challenges and opportunities posed by globalisation. Following the principle of “an open market economy with free competition” is pivotal to fostering long-term economic growth and job creation, increasing the resilience of the euro area to economic shocks and facilitating the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. This was confirmed at the last European Council meeting, when the EU leaders agreed to annex a new protocol to the Treaties, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference. This protocol underlines the fact that an Internal Market which includes a system ensuring that competition is not distorted is indeed indispensable for the good functioning of the EU economies. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * I already said – because it is not the first time that I have been asked such questions – that there was absolutely no case for over-interpreting if I say, on behalf of the Governing Council, “close monitoring” or “very close monitoring”. So there is nothing there that you should add to the interpretation of what we are saying. It is true that this is exactly the same wording as last time. It does not mean that the intention is to change in any respect the present expectations that the market has for, say September and October. No change in the present market expectations is called for in the message of the Governing Council. In any case as you know we never pre-commit to a decision that we will take – again no pre-commitment and no intention to change, in any respect, the present expectations of the market. We will have a further meeting in July and a teleconference in August. We have no plans not to have a teleconference in August. If I have a message on behalf of the Governing Council to convey to you at the beginning of August, I will do so without any difficulty. So I confirm that we are constantly alert, I am available any time and there is no problem at all with that. On your first point, as you know, there will be a Eurogroup meeting. I have been invited by Jean-Claude Juncker to participate in the Eurogroup meeting and I do not want to predict what will be said there. Our message applies to absolutely all countries, but in particular to those countries where we think that there might be a risk of the commitments undertaken not being respected; in particular the Berlin commitment, which I mentioned in the introductory remarks, and the full implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact with a number of provisions that we will certainly insist on. This was the case in Berlin with the 0.5% reduction in the structural deficit year after year and with the commitment to reach the MTOs – the medium-term objectives – as soon as possible, in any case by 2010 at the latest. As regards the IMF, I take this opportunity to pay homage to Mr Rodrigo de Rato and the fantastic job that he has been doing over the years: the medium-term strategy of the IMF and the way he has coped with the modernisation and optimisation of the IMF. Regarding the appointment of the new Managing Director, I will only say that it is not the responsibility of the ECB to participate in the decision-making process. I have observed that the long-standing tradition that has existed since World War II has been followed very recently in the case of its sister institution. I have also noted that all European voices have suggested sticking to this long-standing tradition. At the moment, I cannot say anything else. The Governing Council of the ECB has no position on this matter. As regards your first question, this issue of eliminating certain public spending from the computation of the Maastricht criteria has already been examined. This suggestion has already been made in the past and it was examined during the discussions about revising the Stability and Growth Pact in 2004. As I remember, this suggestion was rejected almost unanimously at that time by members of the Eurogroup and of the ECOFIN Council, because the Stability and Growth Pact is an ECOFIN instrument. As regards your question on the euro exchange rate, I will say again that this is a very important domain where those who have a major responsibility, such as the President of the Eurogroup – because he represents all the executive branches of the 13 countries today and the 15 tomorrow – and myself as the representative of the ECB and the Governing Council, have to be very responsible. The position of this institution, as agreed upon by the Governing Council, and that of our major partners at the level of the G7, is that we consider excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates to be undesirable for economic growth. We all agree – I signed those communiqués along with Jean-Claude Juncker, as well as a number of ministers and central bank colleagues – that in emerging economies with large and growing current account surpluses, especially China, it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that the necessary adjustment will occur. This is the message that we together have on China. We have signed this message and China, as well as the other emerging economies in Asia, knows that. After appropriate discussion in Essen and in Washington, I myself noted that our Japanese colleagues, both the Minister of Finance and the Governor, said they believe that the Japanese economy is on a sustainable recovery path and that the exchange rates should reflect these economic fundamentals. Exchange markets should be aware of the fact that there are two-way risks in any bet. This has been said by the responsible Japanese authorities and repeated recently. I say myself that it is important that they said that. And it is important that the market gets that message. As regards the US Dollar, I have also noted with others that the US authorities have said that a strong dollar was in the interests of the US economy. I will stop there and I warn in advance that all those who would like to hear more comments will be a little bit disappointed, because I will stick to what I have just said, which is crystal clear and reflects our current position! To your first question: any indications that could be given in respect of a possible weakening of the fiscal consolidation would be against, I repeat, against the decisions that have been taken by the various governments themselves, against the recommendations and decisions that have been taken within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact upon the proposal of the Commission and against the Berlin Agreement I referred to in the introductory remarks. It is clear, and this is true for all countries concerned, including of course France and Italy and others, if such signs are given. That being said, I do not want to anticipate the meeting which will take place next Monday at the level of the Eurogroup. To your second question on the structural reforms, again, we are totally backing structural reforms. We know that it is not easy, we know that it calls for courage from the executive branches and from the parliaments and from the social partners, but we are absolutely convinced that it would permit an increase in growth and job creation and in the growth potential of Europe. Anything that would weaken the path of structural reforms is in our opinion not to be recommended at all. That would certainly be the case of the example you gave. We back structural reforms and we stand ready to explain why they are necessary. We encourage and fully support the governments that are embarking on those reforms. To your third question on the growth potential of the euro area, I fully confirm, at this stage, that the position of the Governing Council is that we have not substantiated any conclusion that would permit an increase in the present level of the growth potential that we have in mind, which is around 2.25%. So I confirm the 2.25%; that was our previous assessment. Let me repeat that we are cautious. We are prudent as this concept can be approached through different methodologies, but for the present situation we confirm the 2.25%. As usual, with regard to what we will say in future press conferences and after future meetings of the Governing Council, I will tell you what our judgement is at the next press conference and after the next meeting of the Governing Council. At this stage, I said already all what I had to say on the future. As regards growth and the impact on growth, it is an occasion to repeat what you already know very well, namely that we are absolutely convinced, as are all our colleagues, that when we ensure price stability, we permit sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. And that on the basis of all that we have seen since our decision in December 2005 to increase rates to counter the inflationary risks that we were noticing at that time, we have been, at least until now, fully vindicated in the sentiment that we were helping sustainable growth and job creation. To the extent that we had been criticised from time to time for the fact that we were playing and arbitraging price stability against job creation, the figures are: more than 12 million jobs were created during the eight years since the setting-up of the euro until the end of last year. And before the euro was set up, in the equivalent period of eight years, less than three million had been created. I could of course also embark on national data in various countries. Again, I draw your attention to the fact that there is a global consensus to consider that the prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation is that we ensure price stability and that we are credible in ensuring price stability over time, because it does not suffice to ensure price stability today, we are reasoning over the medium term. That is the reason why the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations through our own credibility is so important. As regards protectionism, I have to say quite sadly, that I have the sentiment that things have not improved in this respect. We are listing this risk as one of the important risks that would weigh down on the global economy. I have nothing to report that I would consider positive in this respect at the global level, and I say that sadly, because we are absolutely convinced that it is the openness of the global economy which is one of the crucial factors for global growth. We are all sharing in this global prosperity, all of us, whether industrialised countries, emerging countries and economies and even the poorest. I said if I have something to say on behalf of the Governing Council, I will find out a nice way to say it and I do not exclude at all a press briefing or a press conference or whatever, I exclude nothing. I refer to the probability that one would extract, oneself, with very sophisticated tools from the present market, and nothing else. On your first question, let me repeat that the over-interpretation of “very closely” and the “closely” without the “very” was an over-interpretation that did not correspond in any respect to a precise message that the Governing Council would wish to ship. I understand that there is a permanent scrutiny of all that we say. But at the same time I draw your attention to looking at what we say, to looking at the full exposition of our diagnosis. That being said there is a particular word that really means something in our own mind: it is “strong vigilance”. It means something, but it does not mean that we are pre-committed. We do whatever is necessary and we are never pre-committed, but I would validate the present interpretation by observers and markets of what it means exactly in terms of anticipation, expectation, when we say it. I understand that there is a lot of meditation on all that we say, but what is important is really what we say and not an over-interpretation of expressions, the place of an adjective, the presence of an adverb or not and so forth. I would like to draw your attention to that. And since we are, in a way, communicating on communication, beware also of the anonymous declarations. There is absolutely no way, no channel of communication of the Governing Council which would be anonymous. All that you read as being anonymous, you have to know that it is not the way the Governing Council communicates. The Governing Council communicates publicly, on the record, and when we have things to say, including on monetary policy and future monetary policy, we will say it. As regards your third question on structural reforms, again, I do not anticipate the next meeting and meetings of the Eurogroup. There are rules and commitments that have been taken within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. We back the structural reforms as well as the commitments undertaken under the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. You know how great the responsibility of the Commission is in this respect, and I am particularly referring to recent decisions, the Berlin decisions, taken under the chairmanship of Peer Steinbrück by all the members, all the executive branches represented by their ministers of finance. As regards your first question: the Governing Council has today adopted an opinion on the opening of an intergovernmental conference (IGC). We understand that, pursuant to the IGC’s detailed mandate, which has been approved by the European Council, the changes to be introduced by the IGC to the current treaties in our domains will cover, and will be limited to, all the innovations that had been agreed at the 2004 IGC. On that basis, we welcome the opening of the IGC and we stand ready to contribute to it at any time during its work and to provide our sentiment on matters within the fields of competence of the ECB. We welcome what has been done and we have observed that we adhere exactly and strictly to what had been approved and accepted on the occasion of the 2004 IGC. We will publish our opinion in the Official Journal of the European Union. Regarding your second point, I do not see how President Sarkozy’s attendance at the meeting could change the dialogue between the ECB and the finance ministers. It is the composition of one delegation which will be different from usual. Let us not forget that Mr Jean-Claude Juncker is himself both a member of the ECOFIN and the European Council. But it would be better to ask this question directly to Mr Juncker – as I am myself invited in the same way as Mr Juncker and Commissioner Almunia are invited to attend the Governing Council. I am not a member of the Eurogroup. I am an invitee to the Eurogroup. First let me mention the importance of this decision in principle for Cyprus and Malta to enter the euro area. The decision has been taken at the level of the Heads of State or Government. We will have the ECOFIN decision next Tuesday on a number of points and I do not wish to speak ahead of that meeting. All I will say is that we started with 11 members, very soon we were 12, a few years later we were 13, now next January we will be 15. It is very impressive in terms of historical evolution. And, having been involved in negotiating the Maastricht Treaty myself, I am absolutely impressed by the fact that when we negotiated the Treaty we had in mind that we would number perhaps seven or eight, or perhaps less. I remember it was said during the course of the negotiation that even if there would be only two countries the euro would have to start in order for the first crystallisation of the single currency to begin. Being 15 next year is very impressive as regards the pace of history. When you enter a single currency area you share a destiny in common. And I can never repeat that often enough because it seems to me that this is the main message. It is a very solemn commitment to be in a single currency area. You have to take into account that all that you do and all the decisions you take must be fully consistent with the fact that you are a member of a single currency area. And whether those decisions are in the realm of fiscal policy, in the realm of structural reforms, or in the realm of wages and salary formation and unit labour costs, all national parameters have to be checked and understood within the framework of membership of the single currency area. We cannot and I cannot say that frequently enough and with sufficient force. Cyprus and Malta will share a destiny in common with the partner countries. On Cyprus, I will only mention that we ourselves said in our convergence report that the issue of reunification was an open issue and our intention was not to advise against the entry of Cyprus to the euro area, but to note in advance that, if and when the time comes, the negotiation of this reunification on the economic, financial and monetary matters should itself be fully compatible with membership of the euro area, with the fact that we hare a destiny in common. I confirm that what we see in the dynamics of the various components and counterparts of the monetary aggregates reflects the fact that we have increased rates, for instance the rate of growth over twelve months of M1 was 7% in March, 6.3% in April and 6.1% in May. In 2005 it was 10.4%. We see clearly that there has been a deceleration of the growth of M1, and the main explanation for that is that we have increased short-term rates. On the contrary, at the level of M3 we see a very high level of dynamism being maintained. The last figure that we have on a 12-month basis is 10.7%. Clearly we have both phenomena operating: on the one hand we have M1 decelerating visibly, and on the other hand we have M3 minus M1 remaining very dynamic, at least until now, in part because of the previous slope of the yield curve. We will see what happens when we have a different slope of the yield curve. I remain cautious because on that point with regard to consumer credit for households, the figures for February, March, April and May are 6.7%, 7.1%, 6.9% and 5.9%. So we see also elements that substantiate some kind of deceleration. All that being said, these are very complex phenomena and we have to remain very alert. Loans to non-financial corporations remain very dynamic and we are at the level of 12.6% of growth over the last twelve months. As you see, we are observing structural transformations. The fact that we have increased rates is visible and it triggers structural transformation. Everything taken into account, when we extract all the information from these data we see that in the medium to longer term the inflationary risks are on the upside, and this is what I said on behalf of the Governing Council. To your first question there is a very strong global consensus – and we share this global consensus – among the industrialised world economies that central banks should have a primary mandate of price stability. Price stability is not contradictory at all with sustainable growth and job creation. On the contrary, there is a very simple logical relationship, whereby price stability is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. When you take your decision on how to ensure price stability, you take all parameters on board – all the information that you have, both domestic and international. The exchange rates are one of the data amongst many others that you take into account when you take your decision to ensure price stability. There has been a consensus since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system that we would live in a floating exchange rate system. And there is also a consensus that when we have messages to convey to observers, market participants, investors and savers the world over, we convey them through the appropriate means, which are the informal meetings of the G7. These are the rules upon which we base the functioning of the present global economy. I refer here to the principles agreed between the partners in the industrialised world, and what I mentioned earlier regarding exchange rates is precisely the implementation of those principles. As regards your second question on protectionism, the Governing Council of the ECB is very profoundly committed to the completion of the Single Market. The Single Market – or common market as the names were changed to emphasise that we are really speaking of an achieved Single Market – was the visionary idea of the founding fathers, and we are doing nothing more than follow in the very straight tracks that were imagined by the founding fathers and that have worked so well up to now. We support the full-fledged achievement of the single market in all domains because we believe that it is a prerequisite for continued prosperity, growth and job creation in Europe. In addition, we advocate proceeding in the best fashion possible against protectionism at a global level, and that is because we think that protectionism at a global level could be a major risk to global growth and global job creation. On your last point, I do not want to give a stamp of approval to any particular computation made by any particular firm. I would only say that, taking all that I have seen published it is not my intention to ship messages aiming at changing anything in what has been computed. And I mentioned both September and October because, according to all that I have seen, there are certain probabilities that are attached to September and other probabilities that are attached to October, and, on behalf of the Governing Council, I do not want to change in any respect what you saw this morning in the various computations. As regards your last question we did talk about fiscal policy this morning, and I already mentioned, on behalf of the Governing Council, our position as regards fiscal policy while presenting the Introductory Statement. We are very attached to the respect of all the rules and the commitments that have been taken. As regards what will be said at the next meeting of the Eurogroup, I do not want to anticipate; it is a meeting of the Eurogroup and it will depend very much on what will be said by the various delegations – not by only one, but by the various delegations that will present their own situations and intentions. These will be the reflections and the decisions of the Eurogroup, amongst the executive branches, on the basis of the proposal and analysis of the Commission. I do not want to anticipate the conclusion which will be drawn following the proposal of the Commission by Jean-Claude Juncker as Chairman of the Eurogroup. As regards VAT, you could see yourself what has happened with the VAT decision in Germany. It undoubtedly has an impact on inflation and Germany represents approximately 30% or more of euro area GDP. France has a GDP which is a little more modest. And then you can make the computation to see the impact. It is clear that we are looking closely at everything that happens in the area of indebtedness and we see a tendency in particular for households to be more and more indebted. We also note that there are big differences from country to country and economy to economy; some are catching up with others and there is an extraordinarily rapid expansion. Others are at a more moderate pace and it is important to have an overall view because the Governing Council’s decisions are taken for the euro area as a whole. As regards the interaction between the dynamism of credit and the dynamism of asset prices in the real estate market in particular, though not only in the real estate market, it is absolutely clear that there is a link. I have already noted here that we could simultaneously see the slowing down of the pace of price increases and the slowing down of the growth of outstanding credit in a number of economies that had observed a great level of buoyancy in the real estate market. It is one of the areas where we also see that what we have been doing over the last year and a half has an impact – a very welcome impact. One of our challenges in this domain is, again, to take decisions at the level of the euro area as a whole in an area where you have great differences from country to country. These differences will probably diminish over time. But at a time when Germany was totally depressed and a small number of economies were totally booming in terms of real estate, the synthesis was a challenging one. We can now see a pick-up in Germany and a slowing down in a number of countries: I remember I could say that in Ireland when we had the outside Governing Council meeting in Dublin and we could say that also for Spain, so we see something like a progressive “rapprochement”. On the first point let me say that the present responsibilities are very clear in Europe. I would not qualify the responsibilities in the rest of the world, but in Europe they are very clear according to the Treaty. There is nothing new. It is exactly the same kind of concept which has existed in this country, Germany, for 50 years, exactly the same kind of concept which has existed, to my knowledge, in most European countries that are members of the euro area since the independence of the central bank. It is the responsibility which has existed in my own country since January 1994. As regards the cooperation between major global partners, we know how it functions in practice and it has functioned well. The messages of the G7 must be the same on both sides of the Atlantic and on both sides of Pacific to be effective. All those messages are signed by both the executive branches and by the central banks. And it was the case before the euro was set up; it has been the case since the euro was set up – nothing has changed. The only big change since the euro was set up is that in addition to the previous members you have the presence of the President of the Eurogroup and you have the presence of the President of the European Central Bank. But the communiqué is signed by my central bank colleague of the United States, my colleague of the United Kingdom, my colleague of Japan, the colleague of Canada. And the communiqué says “ministers and governors”. I draw your attention to that. What counts in practice is that the message or messages are underwritten by both the different global partners and the different authorities in each major economy: monetary authorities and executive branches. In exceptional circumstances this message can be strong. That is the way the world functions at the moment. This does not mean that we do not have challenges. This does not mean that we do not have a lot of issues. But it is the methodology that we have been applying since we have been in this universe of the floating exchange system since the beginning of the 1970s. And in Europe the arrangement we have is an arrangement anchored in the Treaty, and it is fully in line with the European tradition. As regards Slovakia, we do not have a position of the Governing Council on Slovakia and I do not want to comment on question marks that one might have, which are fully legitimate. At this stage we do not have a Governing Council position on Slovakia and I strongly encourage Slovakia to embark resolutely on a convergence programme that would be as active and responsible as possible. "
2007-06-06,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today’s meeting, we decided to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was taken in view of the prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. Today’s decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards fostering sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. After today’s increase, given the positive economic environment in the euro area, our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side, with overall financing conditions favourable, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample. Looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. The Governing Council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Incoming information clearly confirms that the euro area economy continues to expand at a pace which is significantly stronger than generally expected a year ago. With a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.6%, real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2007 was again somewhat above previous expectations. Other available information on economic activity, notably various surveys of business and consumer confidence, suggests that solid growth has continued into the second quarter. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. The conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate. As regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust. External conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from financing conditions which remain favourable, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, balance sheet restructuring as well as business efficiency gains achieved over an extended period. Meanwhile, consumption should be supported by developments in real disposable income, as labour market conditions continue to improve. This outlook is also reflected in the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.3% and 2.9% in 2007 and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. In comparison with the previous ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2007 are within the upper part of the ranges from March. For 2008, the ranges have been revised marginally downwards, following the increase in oil prices over recent months. In the Governing Council’s view, the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At medium to longer horizons, the balance of risks remains on the downside, owing mainly to external factors. These relate in particular to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices, concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and potential shifts in financial market sentiment. As regards price developments, oil prices have risen again over recent months. Accordingly, as reflected in Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in May 2007, unchanged from April but somewhat higher than expected a few months ago. Looking ahead, the short-term profile of annual inflation rates continues to be determined largely by current and past energy price developments, as last year’s volatility in energy prices leads to significant base effects. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, which show an upward slope, annual inflation rates are likely to fall slightly in the months ahead before rising again significantly towards the end of the year. Consistent with this view, Eurosystem staff projects average annual HICP inflation of between 1.8% and 2.2% in 2007 and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 2008. Compared with the March 2007 ECB staff projections, the range projected for inflation in 2007 is somewhat higher, largely reflecting higher oil prices. The projected range for inflation in 2008 is unchanged. In this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including assumptions for future short and long-term interest rates that are based on market expectations derived from the yield curve, as well as assumptions for oil and non-energy commodity prices. At the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, risks to the outlook for price stability remain on the upside in the Governing Council’s view. These risks relate notably to the domestic side. In particular, capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is increasing and labour markets are gradually improving. Accordingly, there is a risk that wage developments will be stronger than expected, which would pose significant upward risks to price stability. In addition, pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. Wage agreements in particular should be sufficiently differentiated to take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and sector-specific productivity developments. The Governing Council stresses that wage developments should be avoided which would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. In addition, upside risks to price stability arise from increases in administered prices beyond those anticipated thus far. Finally, on the external side, upside risks stem from the possibility of further unexpected oil price rises. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. The underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. The ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the continued rapid growth of M3, which reached an annual rate of 10.4% in April, as well as the still high level of credit growth. The strong rate of monetary and credit expansion reflects, in part, favourable financing conditions and solid economic growth. In the short term, monetary and credit developments can be affected, inter alia, by the shape of the yield curve and external factors, and be subject to some degree of volatility. In assessing the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary and credit growth, it is important to look through such transitory aspects. Taking this perspective, there are several indications that higher short-term interest rates are now influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion. For example, increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more moderate expansion of the narrow aggregate, M1, in recent quarters. Equally, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006, albeit at double-digit levels. The stabilisation of loan growth is now becoming more broad-based, as evidenced in recent months by developments in borrowing by non-financial corporations and by households. At the same time, house price growth has come down somewhat, although remaining at high levels on average in the euro area. Taking into account both short-term factors and the underlying trend of the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample. In this environment, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any short-term volatility in inflation rates. The relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to the domestic side. As capacity utilisation increases and labour markets gradually improve, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. As regards fiscal policy, all countries should be in line with the rules and provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. This will be crucial for the smooth functioning of Monetary Union, given that the Stability and Growth Pact is an indispensable part of its institutional setting. Following the significant budgetary improvement recorded in 2006, the latest available forecasts suggest a further reduction in the government deficit-to-GDP ratio of the euro area over the period 2007-08. This reflects in particular projected ongoing strong revenue collection in the context of a favourable macroeconomic outlook. However, the structural improvement is more muted. The current economic “good times” should be used to rapidly redress the remaining budgetary imbalances in euro area countries as well as to accelerate the adjustment towards their medium-term objectives of sound budget positions with a focus on expenditure restraint. As agreed by the euro area finance ministers at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April, taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area members to achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest. This is particularly important with a view to reducing the still high government debt ratios and preparing for the fiscal challenges arising from population ageing. In order to ensure that fiscal developments are monitored effectively, the Governing Council supports all efforts by Eurostat to improve the fiscal data situation. It also welcomes the increased emphasis placed by the ECOFIN Council on measures to improve the quality of public finances and increase the efficiency of public administration. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council fully supports any efforts that enhance competition, increase productivity and foster economic flexibility, thus promoting higher sustainable real GDP growth and employment. In this respect, we strongly back reforms focusing on reducing labour market rigidities, product market barriers and administrative burdens, and on stimulating technological innovation. Exploiting the complementary nature of reforms would increase their benefits in terms of long-term economic dynamism and price stability. Furthermore, the importance of a successful conclusion of the Doha round of trade talks for productivity and growth in Europe should not be underestimated. In the end, higher productivity growth will allow increases in real wages without negatively affecting employment, thereby supporting the income growth of the euro area workforce. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * You heard what I said in my introductory statement. I said that we were still on the accommodative side. I said that the overall financing conditions were favourable. And we will observe all that is to come, as far as data, facts and figures are concerned, to do whatever is necessary to ensure price stability over time. There is no pre-commitment in what I have said. The Governing Council is alert and we will do whatever is needed, as we have in the past, to ensure price stability and be credible in ensuring and delivering price stability. If there is a need for strong vigilance in the future, I will tell you when there is such a need. At the present moment, as I said, we will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise over the medium term. Let me stress that inflationary expectations are anchored, according to various surveys and through different channels, in line with our definition of price stability: less than 2%, close to 2%. A number of surveys suggest that we are around 1.9%, which is in line with our definition. This solid anchoring of inflationary expectations is essential for the prosperity of Europe, is essential for sustainable growth and job creation in Europe. It is based entirely on the credibility of the ECB and our capacity to deliver price stability, not as judged by us, and not even as judged exclusively by Europeans, but as judged by the entire world. This is an ongoing contribution to sustainable growth and job creation. Let me remind all of us that since the euro was set up, we have created more than 12 million jobs. This is much higher than what was achieved in the eight years before the setting-up of the euro, which was over 2 million. And let me also say that it is even more than in the United States, what we have done over the last eight years as regards job creation. This has been permitted, in particular – of course not exclusively – by our capacity to anchor solidly expectations as regards price stability. To your first question: again, we do what is necessary to counter inflationary risks and to be able to permanently deliver price stability over the medium term, which is the pertinent horizon. I will not say anything else than that. And you know that we don’t have a mechanistic approach to our monetary policy. We look at everything, but we are not guided by a concept of neutral rate or a concept of output gap or a concept of NAIRU [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment]. We, again, are making our own judgement, based on collegial wisdom and on experience, on the basis of all information that is pertinent in order to counter the risks. As regards China, we are observing global finances and global markets carefully. A number of events have been observed in the past and will probably continue to be observed in China. I have to say that what we have seen till now has been, it seems to me, quite well understood and absorbed by markets that have proved to be resilient, and I expect that it will continue to be so. First of all, you are a very attentive observer. So you were right to note that we were on the accommodative side on the one hand, still, and you were also right to note that I did not say on behalf of the Governing Council that interest rates were moderate. I said that financing conditions were favourable. Also I have just repeated, in the previous response, that we are not pre-committed in any respect. Markets know that pretty well because it is our constant position. I will certainly not comment on the figure that you have been mentioning. There are various figures depending on certain methodologies. I will only say, yes, you have noted very carefully what I have said on behalf of the Governing Council. We are free to do what we would judge appropriate when the time comes, but at the present moment, I don’t want to comment any more on probabilities. Again, we are not pre-committed in any respect and I will not comment on the “August” question. There is no particular case for me to say at this stage that we would meet physically in August. Again, we are never pre-committed. You know that and I will stress it once again. On the “accommodative side” question, it is true that we said “still” and not “continues to be”. You are a legendary, a very attentive listener, observer and watcher! On the mention of potential shifts in financial market sentiment, it is something I have already said when responding to questions on the disorderly unwinding of global imbalances, namely that we were also incorporating in this concept the concept of a shift in market sentiment that would not be orderly and smooth but would be more sharp. I think there is nothing really new in the message of the Governing Council in this respect; it is an elaboration on that kind of possible risk that we see in the global economy. As with all countries that are a member of the European Union and not yet a member of the euro area, what is very important for us - because it is required by the Treaty - is that the convergence as measured objectively by the Treaty be met, and that means that a number of criteria be met, and be met on a sustainable basis. This is the wording of the Treaty. So it seems to me that Romania has a lot of homework to do. That homework is being done, and it has to continue to be done in an active fashion over a number of years in order to meet those criteria. It seems to me very clear that this means structural reforms, it means sound fiscal policy, it means sound monetary policy and also pursue liberalisation of all markets. And this is not only required by the convergence criteria, but is also very important in the national interest of any country, and in particular of Romania. That is as regards entry into the euro area. You had a second question? The biggest challenges, again, are probably the structural reforms and the overall sustainable delivery of a good macroeconomic policy – that is what really counts. I think that what we have been doing since our increase of rates in December 2005 has certainly served our purpose very well. We have anchored – in line with our previous record – the inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability over that year and a half. We have maintained fully our credibility and we have continued to serve our primary mandate. Because we have been faithful to our primary mandate – as it is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation – we have served the European economy well. Let's remember that when we increased rates in December 2005 we had a number of observers, a number of institutions that were advising us not to do so. Today, at the present time, all of them, including the IMF and the OECD, are saying that we were very well-founded in that decision and in all the decisions we have been taking until now, including that one. So we have eight successive increases that are considered to be wise. We have been fully vindicated in what we have been doing. As regards your second question, it's true that the monetary pillar played an important role when we took our decision in December 2005 and I said several times that it was one of the important reasons why we judged that it was time to act. And again, we have been vindicated. I would say the monetary pillar always plays its role in our two-pillar strategy. I have elaborated a little bit on behalf of the Governing Council on what is happening in terms of monetary developments. I mentioned the fact that some of the counterparts and some of the components of the monetary aggregates were signalling that our previous interest rate increases were influencing what we were observing: for instance, M1 in April was growing at 6.2%, in March it was 7%. And we will see what happens, but this clearly indicates that the change in our interest rates is operating in this respect. I would say for the loans to households, for instance, that it is interesting to see that April signals 7.6%, in March we had 7.9%, in Q4 2006 we were over 8%, in Q2 and Q3 2006 we were over 9%. So we see the influence of our interest rate increases in this respect, too. I could mention house purchases, the financing of house purchases, in the same way: in April 8.6%, in February 9.4%. So we see a number of elements that are interesting. I mention these and you know that our monetary pillar is based upon a broad and deep analysis of, components, of counterparts, of sectoral breakdowns and of a deep understanding of the dynamics that are behind it. This is considered by us as important, enlightening and as something which allows us to take the wisest possible decision on the basis of this binocular approach that we are very attached to. On the United States of America: I have always said that we very much rely upon the analysis of the Federal Reserve System and that we believe that their analysis is a pertinent one. I said that we have been vindicated ourselves in the recent past for our own analysis and judgement. And I would say that equally the Fed has been vindicated in its own judgement of the US economy. For us, we have always had good trust in the analysis of the Fed. It is something which I note with satisfaction. On the second question, there is no division in the Governing Council on the monetary pillar. We are all attached, and the Governing Council as the pertinent entity is attached, to the monetary pillar. I have said already that the monetary pillar was in the monetary policy concept of a large number of national central banks, not only the Bundesbank but in my previous institution, Banque de France, in particular, we had an explicit reference to the monetary analysis. We have the same vision of the monetary analysis as being deep, broad, as aiming at having as profound an understanding as possible of the various dynamics that are inside the various components, the sectoral breakdown and the counterparts. We consider that in a universe which is more and more characterised by “financiarisation”, or the role of finance in the modern economies, it is even more justified than before. Let me also say that we have the impression that in this respect quite a number of observers, academics and central banks are thinking that it is good to complement the economic analysis by a monetary analysis. I have already mentioned that my friend Mervyn King had said that publicly, including in a Select Committee of the House of Commons. And you could also see such sentiment expressed in a number of other central banks. That was for your second question, and you had a third question on potential growth. On potential growth I would say that at this stage we are working a lot on this, but as far as the Governing Council is concerned, we would not underwrite a new assessment of the growth potential, even if some indications are there that labour productivity is picking up. To disentangle what is cyclical and what is structural in what we observe, we need time. We need appropriate research. If and when we conclude that it is time to modify our own estimate of the growth potential of the euro area, I will immediately tell you that. At this stage, on behalf of the Governing Council, I would say that I stick to what we had already said, with the sentiment that at around 2.25% we probably are in an area which might be pertinent. But, again, I don’t exclude that we could modify our assessment – at this stage it would be premature. It is an issue, you are absolutely right. It is an issue for the G8 summit of industrialised countries. I know the work which has been done by the German Presidency in this respect. I had a number of occasions myself to mention that the ECB was looking at this issue very carefully. As you may know, in the Financial Stability Report that we have published we mentioned explicitly that this was a very important issue. Let me only say that we had already the report of the Financial Stability Forum at the level of the global economy which had been requested by the G8. The conclusions of this progress report are very interesting. I would say that we would very much subscribe to these conclusions and they are also in line with a number of national reflections. To sum up, it would rely very much on the core intermediaries being the key point to ensure an improvement of the situation. So the supervisory authorities would be called upon to ensure that the core intermediaries, particularly the big commercial and investment banks that are in direct contact with the hedge funds, have the best risk management practices possible, are correctly enlightened on all the risks they are taking and have a correct understanding and a correct information on what the hedge funds are doing. And that of course relies upon the vigilance of the supervisory authorities themselves, because these core intermediaries fall in their jurisdiction. There was a consensus on this report, and I am paraphrasing its conclusions: it is very important that these core intermediaries embark on the appropriate stress-testing in order to ensure that they would hold up in case of problems that would emerge from the sphere of the hedge funds. The core intermediaries are also called upon to reinforce considerably their call for transparency vis-à-vis hedge funds. And the hedge funds themselves are called upon to work out benchmarks on what would be the best behaviour possible as regards transparency vis-à-vis core intermediaries and transparency vis-à-vis their own investors – those individuals or entities that are giving them their capital – and a benchmark for their own internal risk management systems. At this stage, I would say that it seems that there is a consensus that we should make progress along all the lines I have suggested, including the call to the industry itself to work out voluntarily what these benchmarks would be. I could perhaps call that a set of principles and I am very attached personally to the voluntary principles or benchmarks for appropriate behaviour and conduct that would be devised by the industry itself. I know that there is no consensus for administrative codes or new regulations. At this stage, I have to say that the ECB has never called for new administrative codes and regulations, but we are certainly calling for very active work in the various areas that I have mentioned, including the work to be done by the industry itself on a purely voluntary basis. It is an important question and I would give the same response as I already gave. It is good to enter when you are as fit as possible. I know that Bulgaria has done quite a lot of good work and we have to recognise that. The reforms are being pursued and real growth has been important, so Bulgaria is certainly to be congratulated for the results that have been obtained. On the other hand, it is clear that we still have imbalances in this country, including a very large current account deficit. So all this suggests a picture with strong points and weak points and we will see when the time comes what the position of the various authorities concerned, including of course the government and the central bank of Bulgaria, would be. We will see what happens. I think the previous decisions that were taken by the authorities of Slovakia were justified and I expect that the functioning of ERM II will continue to be as orderly as it has been in the past. We will see when the time comes what our judgement is on the stability of the currency. I do not want to prejudge at this stage and we will see again if and when the Slovakian authorities are presenting a request. You know what our position on the Cyprus request is: we have already published, as well as the European Commission, our Convergence Report. I will not elaborate on that, it has been made public. We mentioned explicitly ourselves the reunification of Cyprus as being a challenge, an issue that we had to keep in mind. We did not conclude that it was premature or inappropriate for Cyprus to enter the euro area, but we meant that it was something which was very important for the future, if and when there is a reunification, in order for the negotiations from the economic and financial and monetary standpoint of the reunification to be very well crafted in the interest of Cyprus – which goes without saying – and also in the interest of the euro area as a whole. I have nothing to add to that. The notion of liquidity is a very complex notion. A number of market participants are mentioning liquidity to characterise the situation where they see “capital chasing investment” or “money chasing ideas”, something which they note as being a little bit exceptional, because in other times, and perhaps in more normal times, you see the contrary, you see “ideas chasing money or capital”, you see “investment chasing financing or capital”. This situation is clearly driven by a large number of reasons. And I do not want to elaborate too much on these reasons, but publicly, yesterday, on the occasion of the International Monetary Conference, together with Ben Bernanke and Toshihiko Fukui, we had elaborated on that and I had myself said: Look, you have perhaps five reasons why we are observing that ex ante savings are at a global level superior to ex ante investment. And that creates the present observation that the pricing of risks is lower than it would be in – I would say – more normal times. Among these various reasons you have certainly the fact that most emerging countries are posting big current account surpluses. You have the fact that in a number of economies, not in Europe now, but in a number of economies you had physical investment by corporate businesses that were lower than what would have been suggested by econometric equations based on past observations and it is certainly the case in the United States. And you had also among all those reasons the remarkable creativity that we are observing in the global financial markets as regards derivatives and the way of splitting, of repackaging, of reformatting risks with the consequence of enlarging formidably the scope of the investors that are risk buyers. And also a major reason would be the oil shock: the fact that we have additional forced savings that are adding up to the pot of savings that we have at a global level. All this taken into account, I would say that we are – all of us, because we were in very good agreement – saying that we believe that we have to pave the way for some kind of orderly and smooth adjustment associated with the reassessment of risks. We say it not to dramatise the situation, but because there are very good reasons, namely what we are observing today on the market. On top of that, let us not forget that the real economy is performing well at a global level, but it seems to us that it is our duty to say: let us calmly prepare for a smooth and orderly reassessment of risks when the time comes, in order to avoid what would not be good for the real global economy, namely an adjustment which would not be orderly and smooth. The answer to your first question is no and as regards your second question, I already made all the comments necessary. I have said that what we consider pertinent is the overall analysis, which is not attached only to one particular aggregate, one particular component or one particular counterpart. We try to understand the dynamics of this complex matrix. And on the basis of our understanding of these dynamics we conclude that risks to price stability in the longer term are signalled by this overall analysis. We do not have a mechanistic approach, neither in the monetary nor in the economic analysis. So, in answer to your question, I would say that we make a judgement on the basis of all that we see. Our judgement today is that, for the longer term, there are risks to price stability embedded in what we are observing, even if the dynamics are very different as regards a number of counterparts. We have an understanding of the qualification of accommodation that is multi-dimensional. I said already that we do not refer to a neutral rate, and that we do not refer to any such concepts. We believe that, on the basis of all that we are observing, it is justified to say that we are still on the accommodative side. I do not want to elaborate more on that, other than to say that, in any case, the needle of our compass is that we make a judgement on what is necessary to counter inflationary risks at any given moment. We judge what is necessary to counter inflationary risks in various circumstances, and circumstances do not cease to change. Of course there are external influences, from the global economy, and there are a number of domestic factors that are moving, and they move in the ways that can be very significant. If I take, for instance, the last four quarters of the European economy – the last four quarters that are known – I was very impressed to see that now, as a very significant engine of growth, we have gross capital formation. I mentioned the fact that in the case of other economies, perhaps, this engine was not important. In our own case, if I take again the last four quarters, including the first quarter of this year, we have growth that would be around 3%, and half of the contribution comes from gross capital formation. That is very important and very impressive, and it shows the extent to which things might change quite rapidly in the present functioning and development of the European economy. That is important not only because the contribution to growth is important, but because it is a way of coping with what I mentioned as one of our emerging problems, namely the level of capacity utilisation. It is not by chance that we see this gross capital formation increasing in the productive sector; it is something which is important in order to cope with this pressure in the productive sector as regards capacity utilisation. First of all, on the Chinese currency, I signalled yesterday, as I had before, that we were in full agreement with the United States, because we signed the very same communiqué of the G7. And I mention it as something which was absolutely obvious, that we had the same message and the same terms of reference agreed upon in a communiqué that we have had for a long time. Indeed, the first time was on the occasion of the G7 meeting at the beginning of 2004, when I signed it on behalf of the Governing Council of the ECB, together with the United States, Japan, the UK and Canada. On the yen, I do not want to bore you, but I will repeat what I have already said that I have noted what the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the central bank have said, namely that markets should progressively take into account and recognise the progress that has been made in the domestic economy in Japan, progress which is very substantial. And on the United States of America, I would also say what I have already said: I had noted myself and it has been noted with great attention on this side of the Atlantic that the US authorities, including the Secretary of the Treasury, had said that a strong dollar was in the interests of the US economy. Again, we made our judgement, the Commission made its judgement, the decision has to be taken by the EU Council, namely by the college of governments and it will be made very soon. So I do not want to anticipate a decision which is a very important one and will be made at the appropriate level, namely at the level of Heads of States and Governments. Let me only say that for all countries that are members of the EU or members of the euro area, or already members of ERM II, the best handling of their own policies is absolutely of the essence. We have rules in Europe, one should respect the rules in Europe, and I have mentioned the particular attention that we would give if and when there is a reunification. It seems to us that it would be very important that the negotiation drives Cyprus and consequently the euro area in the best and soundest position possible. The ECB has a mandate, the mandate is given by the Treaty, the mandate is to ensure price stability for 318 million people. By being credible in ensuring it in a vast continental economy which has a dimension of the order of magnitude of the United States of America, we are fulfilling a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation in Europe, in the euro area. Those who are members of ERM II are of course considerably helped by the fact that the anchor of their currency is reliable and credible. I have a feeling that all the institutions concerned, commercial banks as well as investment banks, as well as highly-leveraged institutions are listening to what we say. I also have the sentiment that they are very much sharing our analysis. We are certainly not isolated in developing this analysis. They have improved their own resilience, it seems to me. They have improved their risk management concepts across the board. They have embarked on sophisticated stress-testing in order to complement the traditional value-at-risk computation, and so forth. So, I would have a relatively positive judgement on their awareness that they are living in an environment which includes risks and that it is their duty to take into account those risks and to be ready to weather a possible materialisation of those risks. I would not be negative at all in that respect. What remains true is that global finance has proved to be very resilient. The last two or three shocks that we had in recent years and months have been very rapidly absorbed by the market and we have to consider that it is also something which is important to see that when there are some shocks, they are absorbed by the normal functioning of markets. There are, as I said, good reasons for risks to be priced as they are. What we know is that the situation is not sustainable in the long run. What we are doing together, the central bank constituency on the one hand, the banking supervisory authorities on the other hand, as well as the industry, is to be done as seriously as possible to weather the adjustment when shocks materialise. As we say in the central banks, we are not paid not to worry, we are paid to worry! It is our duty to signal risks, and it is part of the signalling of risks that permits global finance and the global economy to be as impressive as they are. Do not forget that it is not a new phenomenon. We have an ongoing process since the crisis of the end of the 1990s, since the tech bubble explosion, since the Asian crisis, since LTCM [Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund], and so forth. We have been working a lot to improve, in particular, risk management and I take it again that it would be equally wrong to be too complacent and to underestimate the risks and also to say nothing is being done. A lot of things are being done but it is our duty to encourage all participants, including the private sector, to be as active as possible in doing a good job in this respect. "
2007-05-10,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference here in Dublin. I would like to thank Governor Hurley for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in March. Strong vigilance is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. In turn, this will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ECB interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. Turning first to the economic analysis, the latest indicators and survey data confirm that the expansion of economic activity continued in the first quarter of 2007 and remains solid and broad-based. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic growth in the euro area continues to be favourable. Conditions are in place for the ongoing expansion to proceed at sustained rates. Global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat in recent quarters, remains strong. External conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, strong corporate earnings and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, increasingly supported by employment growth and improving labour market conditions. The risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At longer horizons, the balance of risks remains on the downside, stemming mainly from external factors. Such factors include fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices and concerns about possible disorderly developments due to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in April 2007, after 1.9% in March. Looking at the coming months, barring further increases in oil prices, significant base effects deriving from last year’s energy price volatility will strongly influence the profile of annual inflation rates. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall somewhat in the months to come, before rising again towards the end of the year to hover at levels around 2%. Over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks. These relate notably to the increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area economy, the possibility of further oil price rises and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area countries with particular attention. It is crucial that the social partners meet their responsibilities so as to continue to avoid wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. In this context, it is also important to point out that wage agreements should be sufficiently differentiated and take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and productivity developments across sectors. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. The underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. The ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the increasingly rapid growth of M3, which in March reached an annual rate of 10.9%, as well as in the ongoing high levels of credit growth. Monetary and credit expansion is due partly to the moderate level of interest rates and solid economic growth. Short-term monetary and credit developments can be affected, inter alia, by the shape of the yield curve and external factors, and be subject to some degree of volatility. Looking through such transitory aspects, there are, however, several indications that higher short-term interest rates are influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of these dynamics. For example, increases in short-term rates have served to moderate the expansion of the narrow aggregate, M1, in recent quarters, but its annual growth is still robust. Equally, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006, albeit at double-digit levels. All in all, taking into account both short-term factors and the underlying trend of the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. In fact, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. In this environment, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any short-term volatility in inflation rates. The relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of ongoing robust growth in employment and economic activity. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to be strongly vigilant in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. In relation to fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the recent commitment by the euro area finance ministers – at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April – to make full use of the current economic growth and better than expected tax revenues to pursue sound fiscal policies and to avoid procyclical policies in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. In the view of the Governing Council, this requires a rigorous implementation of 2007 budgets, the avoidance of expenditure overruns and the full allocation of unexpected extra revenues to deficit and debt reduction. For 2008, countries with remaining fiscal imbalances are expected to pursue more ambitious than planned budgetary targets As a result, all euro area countries should achieve their medium-term objective of sound budgetary positions as soon as possible and by 2010 at the latest. Moreover, all countries should avoid fiscal policies that feed macroeconomic imbalances. This would allow euro area countries to prepare themselves for less favourable economic conditions. As repeatedly stressed, the Governing Council fully supports structural reforms that enhance competition, increase productivity and foster economic flexibility, thus promoting the potential for real GDP growth and employment. Increased productivity also allows for increases in real wages without negatively impacting on employment, thereby supporting the income growth of the euro area work force. In recent years, average wage increases in the euro area as a whole have been rather moderate, making a vital contribution to job creation and lower unemployment. It is important that this favourable trend in labour markets continues, so contributing to a prolonged and robust upswing. In this respect, sufficient wage differentiation is required so as to improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in sectors and regions with high unemployment. Furthermore, the removal of impediments to labour mobility would help to address local imbalances in labour markets and to enhance the adjustment flexibility of euro area economies to economic shocks. The euro area could reap major benefits from these policies in terms of economic dynamism, more job creation, lower unemployment and increased per capita income. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * As regards your first question, yes, we were unanimous. As regards your second question, I think that what I said speaks for itself. And that there is absolutely no ambiguity, we are in a posture of strong vigilance. On the other hand, we never pre-commit in advance, and you know that. And as regards your third question, of course, all that we do is always data-dependent. First of all I have said that to the President of the Republic of Ireland, that very often, I and my colleagues of the Governing Council are mentioning the Irish economy as a role model in many respects for the euro area. In terms of growth, in terms of dynamism, in terms of job creation, in terms of long-standing reform strategy, with economic reforms that are paying off in many respects. And the present levels of figures that we can observe as regards job creation, the diminishing of unemployment, the GDP per capita based on this long-standing growth of the economy are very impressive. I will also make the remark that what we are deciding ourselves, together with John Hurley and the Vice-President and all our other colleagues, is based upon our judgement on the vast economy that is the euro area, 318 million people – our fellow citizens, 13 countries, from Dublin to Ljubljana, from Lisbon to Helsinki. And each of us has the duty, according to the Treaty, to reflect on what is necessary in the superior interest of this vast economy, and not embarking on discussions on what is good for country A, country B or country C. It is really the superior interest of the vast economy, which is at stake. That being said, I have noted with colleagues that we have, at the level of the euro area as a whole, to look very carefully at the real estate sector, at dynamism of loans to real estate for financing housing in particular. In our recent decisions and interest-rate increases we took into account this situation as one of the parameters that we have mentioned very often in the introductory remarks to the press conference. As regards the most recent observations in Ireland, I would very much like John to comment on your question but it seems to me that we have been going in the right direction, and the signs are that the tensions that were observed in the past are progressively, slowly, cooling down. And I would very much like John to make a comment here. Hurley: Thank you very much, there is little to add; the decisions that are made here and in Frankfurt in the Governing Council are decisions for the euro area as a whole, as the President has said. In relation to the Irish property market, you probably will recall that last year, house prices in Ireland were rising at about 15% and at that time, I indicated clearly that I thought that that level of increase was too high and I thought that it could not be sustained. What we have seen since is a reduction in the level of price increases and I think in March, on an annual basis, these prices would now be increasing at about 7%. So it is clear that this year I think the growth in house prices will be down to single figures, low single figures and I think this is a positive thing and I think that it shows we have a soft landing in the Irish property market. On the volatility of M3, money and credit developments, let me say that we were quite explicit in the introductory remarks, in mentioning that we have had some indications that previous interest rate increases were modifying the structure of M3, the structure of its components and the structure of its counterparts. And I have mentioned as regards the structure of the components that we were reasonably happy to see that M1 had slowed down – but I have to mention that in the most recent period of time we have seen this slowdown somewhat interrupted. Nevertheless, we have seen that our previous interest rate increases were working. And I would say the same for loans to the private sector. To give you precise figures: for example in March we could see that outstanding loans to the financial corporate were still very dynamic, at 12.4%. But in January, for instance, we were at 13.2%. As regards lending for house purchases, John was mentioning a slowing down in the case of Ireland. I mention that at the level of the euro area as a whole – the last figure we have is that the outstanding amount was augmenting over 12 months in March by 8.9%. In November last year it was 10.2%, so we see a certain cooling down of this counterpart of M3. All this is important and we work a lot to understand as well as possible the dynamics of the counterparts, the dynamics of the components that are making up M3 in a context which is very peculiar, in particular with this low level of long-term rates the flatness in the yield curve being the mark of the present situation. Not only, of course, in our case but all over the world. You had also a question on the reference value. That it is a concept, which we trust, is useful over the medium to longer term, because it allows the central banks to be reminded of the fundamental principle that over sufficiently long-term horizons, the rate of monetary growth must be consistent with the price stability objective. That being said, over the medium to long term, the deviation of money growth from the reference value should not be and has never been interpreted mechanically. This has been made absolutely clear since the very beginning of the display of the monetary policy of the ECB and it is what we have been doing, as you have seen, since the very beginning. It was reiterated at the time of the clarification we made in 2003. So again I would only say that we have a vision of the monetary pillar, which is a vision that it is very important. We are extremely attached to the monetary pillar and this is something that has been constantly repeated. My sentiment is that the necessity of having a monetary analysis to permit a better understanding of monetary policy in general is gaining ground. I could mention many colleagues, including the Governor of Bank of England, who have mentioned very explicitly that it was certainly an area where a lot of pertinent information could be obtained for central banks and for their decision-making processes. Again the full understanding of components and counterparts of the dynamics of credit brings about a lot of pertinent and important information and I have mentioned that in all introductory statements I remember. I have nothing to add to the introductory remarks. We consider that we are on the accommodative side, on the one hand, and I am very clear on that at the moment I am speaking. On the other hand, as you know, we always take into account all pertinent parameters. We make a synthesis on the basis of data and of appropriate and pertinent information. I said that we are in the posture of strong vigilance and that we never pre-commit in advance. On your first question, I give you a rendezvous in Frankfurt in June and I will tell you then how we see things after June. At this stage, I will only say that after June we will do whatever is necessary to ensure price stability and that is of course on the basis of this fundamental working assumption made by all the investors, savers and market participants that we can have the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability and that is true for the next five or ten years. So again this anchoring is based upon the right assumption that we do what is necessary to do to deliver price stability and are credible in the delivery of price stability over time. As regards the risks, I have mentioned explicitly a number of risks. Of course we always analyse risks to price stability, and I have mentioned very explicitly the risks to price stability that we see. I have also mentioned the risks for the real economy that are mainly stemming from external observations that we might have on the side of the global real economy and I have mentioned in particular protectionism. I have mentioned a possible increase of oil and commodity prices. I have also mentioned the risk of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. I could add that we are permanently reflecting on the disorderly unwinding of what I would call in global finance the certain degree of under-pricing of risks, which is also something that we have to consider as a risk. But again this has been already said in the introductory remarks. And, as regards prices, it is precisely because we consider that risks are on the upside in terms of price stability that I have mentioned this posture of strong vigilance. On the first question: we take into account all pertinent elements when we take our decision. I have always said that. And we will always do what is necessary to ensure the appropriate and credible delivery of price stability over time. If we did not do that and were not credible in doing that, then inflationary expectations would go up, as would the incorporation of inflationary expectations in the yield curve, and the result would of course be a financial environment which would be much less favourable. So the credible delivery of price stability in line with our definition is a precondition for sustainable job creation and sustainable growth. And we profoundly trust that we can demonstrate this with facts and figures. Let me only mention that we have been credible in this since the euro area was set up, since the very beginning under the chairmanship of Wim Duisenberg, who was the President when we had our previous “delocalised” meeting here in Dublin. And allow me to mention that we have created more than 12 million jobs in the euro area in the eight years since the setting-up of the euro, compared with less than 3 million in the eight years before. I could add a number of other elements that are very telling in terms of the performance that we have had and we trust profoundly were achieved thanks to our credibility in the delivery of price stability. As regards the accord that took place in Germany, I think that precisely in our own judgement we said that one would have to continue to take into account in all further negotiations the parameters I have mentioned: the competitiveness of the various entities concerned, whether they are sectors or enterprises, the level of labour productivity increases and the level of unemployment observed in the euro area economies and sectors. All this has to be looked after very carefully if we want to continue to have price stability, to preserve the purchasing power of our fellow citizens and to have sustained growth and sustained job creation. Again job creation during the last years is one of the major successes that the euro area can be proud of. Again, I will give you a rendezvous in June. We will have new information, we will have new data and it will be the appropriate moment for the Governing Council to decide, and for the Vice-President and myself to say, what we will do after the June meeting. At the present moment, I do not want to give you any other indication but that we will continue after June to do what in our view is necessary to do to deliver price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. That is the needle of our compass. I have absolutely no idea which country you are alluding to. But, for all countries and for all regions of the euro area we call again and very strongly for sound fiscal policies. This country you are mentioning is probably a country, which is growing rapidly. If this is the case, then you have to do on the fiscal side all what is necessary in terms of soundness and rigour in order to be sure that you are paving the way for periods when growth is less flattering. This is our constant message for the entire euro area. We would certainly also call for unit labour cost preserving competitiveness and wage moderation according to the level of labour productivity progress that can be made in order to preserve long-term competitiveness and again, pave the way for long-term sustainable active growth. All partners in all regions of the euro area must be fully aware of the fact that we are issuing a currency at the level of a vast economy which is a good store of value, which is credible, and which inspires confidence. The single monetary policy is designed at the level of this vast economy. Then at the level of each economy or region, all other instruments that are in the hands of these economies or regions, must be optimised in order to fully take into account all the parameters. That being said, I was happy to see that, as I said recently in Berlin, the ECOFIN, the Eurogroup, has decided to be even clearer in terms of the objectives that have to be reached at the latest in 2010. I have already said, on behalf of the Governing Council, that this decision is a very important one, that we support it, and encourage the governments to do all they can to fully respect this commitment. I have noted that the call for a change to our mandate is a request which is no longer being made by the new French President. I draw your attention to the fact that your question corresponds to something, which is not substantiated at the moment we are speaking…. No, it is no longer a request. You can check, but it has been made public and, of course, I am very happy that it is absolutely clear that our mandate is not called into question by any country and that the Treaty is not called into question by any country at the moment I am speaking. It is important that you gave me an occasion to reiterate that. On the exchange rates: You know to what extent I call for discipline in this domain. And let me only say what I already said recently in Washington and in Berlin that I have noted with great interest that the US Secretary of the Treasury and the US authorities have confirmed that a strong dollar was in the interest of the United States. On your second point, we are looking very carefully at our international environment. I mentioned that it is from the international environment that we see the main risks, which would be downward risks for the real economy in Europe. I have also said, and I maintain this sentiment, that we trust the analysis that the Fed does of the US domestic economy and of the sub-prime mortgage market in particular. I would say that we have a phenomenon there, which is certainly important, but also is an orderly one. And I will not change my sentiment on that particular point. On your last point: we look ourselves at the HICP indicator, namely at the harmonised CPI. We look very carefully at harmonised indicators and I would only say that for us it is that which is important. The harmonised indicator in Ireland is still high, it’s at 2.9%, if I am not mistaken, and of course it is above the definition of price stability that we have for the harmonised index in the euro area and above the present average at the level of the euro area. I believe that the trend would go in the right direction at the level of Ireland but perhaps John would like to say a word on that. And I would call on all social partners here as in all other economies and regions in the euro area to show a maximum level of responsibility – for all the reasons that I have already explained: to preserve sustainable growth and job creation and to preserve the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. Hurley: Just to pick up on that point in relation to the trend on the CPI and the trend on the HICP: It seems to us that for 2007 we would expect the harmonised index to be about 2.5% and the CPI which, as you know, is affected by mortgage interest rates, to be about 4.8%. Now next year, in 2008, we would expect the harmonised index to be 2%, a little above 2%, and the consumer price index to be 2.7%. The CPI takes the impact of mortgage increases into account, and I think we are the only euro area country that includes the mortgage interest repayments in its domestic measure of inflation. So, I think the most meaningful comparison across the euro area is, as the President said, the harmonised index. Question [in Irish]: A question with regard to the housing market. Since the beginning of 2007, house prices appear to have slowed down. Does this mean that the prices are being corrected? And if it is a correction, does this mean a fall in prices, a major fall in prices, particularly if the interest rate rises in June? Hurley [in Irish]: From 1 January 2007, Irish is an official working language of the European Union and it is such an occasion for me to be here today in that regard. This is the first time on the occasion of the meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council that we can explain these issues through the medium of Irish. With regard to the question, as I said a few minutes ago, last year there was an increase of about 15% in the housing market in Ireland. I said at the time that I wasn't happy with that, that it was too high. We knew at the time that it couldn’t continue on like that and now it has reduced. I think that we will be down to lower single figures later on this year. As I said already, this means to me that we have a good chance of having a soft landing. We weren’t happy when we were talking about an increase of 15% and, as I said, we knew that could not be sustained. At the moment of speaking it is not the case, if I’m not misled. But I will restate that I have noted with great interest that the Secretary of the United States Department of the Treasury and the American authorities have said that a strong dollar is in the interests of the USA. It is absolutely true that among the counterparts of M3 that appear particularly dynamic, in the most recent month, we have the external counterpart. We must analyse very carefully the dynamics that are underneath. We have also observed that in the past, so it’s not a new phenomenon, but it is an important one. In general – again – all decision-makers and all partners, in particular social partners, but not only – all those who have an influence on any region or any domestic economy, should take into account the fact that the monetary policy is a monetary policy which is optimised at the level of the full, vast economy of the euro area, at the level of the 318 million citizens. And this is true for all elements of the economic policy that are not in the hands of the single monetary policy but in the hands of other authorities and partners, and they are numerous, undoubtedly. "
2007-04-12,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in March. It has also confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks, so that very close monitoring of all developments is warranted. Indeed, it is essential to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ECB interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. Turning first to the economic analysis, recent information has underpinned our assessment of ongoing robust economic growth dynamics in the euro area. Eurostat’s second estimate has confirmed quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2006 at 0.9%. Over the whole year 2006, real GDP grew by 2.7% in the euro area, unadjusted for the number of working days. On the basis of the latest data, survey releases and various indicator-based estimates, it appears that robust growth is continuing in the first half of 2007. Looking further ahead, the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to grow solidly. As regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains strong. External conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, increasingly supported by employment growth and improving labour market conditions. The risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At longer horizons, downside risks remain, stemming mainly from the external side. They relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in March 2007, compared with 1.8% in the first two months of the year. A detailed breakdown of the March HICP data is not yet available. Looking ahead, barring further increases in oil prices, last year’s volatility in energy prices will lead to significant base effects, thereby affecting the profile of annual inflation rates this year. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall in the months to come, before rising towards the end of the year to hover again at around 2%. Over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks. These relate to the possibility of further oil price rises and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. In this context, wage agreements should take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, as well as productivity developments. The Governing Council monitors the wage negotiations in euro area countries with particular attention. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth increased further to 10.0% in February, from 9.9% in January. At the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, while remaining very strong at 10.3% in February, showed some further signs of moderation. Whereas in previous months this moderation reflected a decline in the growth rate of household borrowing in an environment of rising mortgage lending rates throughout the euro area and a slowing increase in house prices in some regions, in February it was due to a moderation in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations. When assessing such developments, it should be borne in mind that monthly figures can be influenced by temporary factors and should thus not be overstated. Indeed, the strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the strong trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. When put in perspective, the latest data continue to point to vigorous dynamics in the underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area. The continued robust expansion of money and credit reflects the low levels of interest rates over a prolonged period of time and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. Rising short-term interest rates, in combination with low long-term interest rates, have had an impact on developments in the individual components of monetary and credit aggregates, but have thus far had only a limited influence on the overall strength of monetary developments. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. In this environment of ample liquidity, the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look through any short-term volatility in inflation rates. The relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of ongoing robust growth in employment and economic activity. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments. Indeed, it is essential to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. Concerning other policy areas, the Governing Council welcomed the recommendations addressed to the euro area countries in the 2007 update of the Integrated Guidelines, which was endorsed by the European Council at its meeting on 8 and 9 March, particularly to speed up fiscal consolidation, to improve the quality of public finances, to foster competition and integration, and to promote labour market reforms. Indeed, as regards fiscal policy, it is of the utmost importance to use the momentum of the improved economic situation and to press ahead vigorously with budgetary consolidation. Government deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios in euro area countries in 2006 have turned out to be significantly better than anticipated. But this positive outcome largely reflects buoyant tax revenues in the context of a favourable macroeconomic environment, offsetting in some cases higher than planned public expenditure. The better than expected fiscal outcomes in 2006 should lead to more ambitious targets for 2007 and beyond, allowing revenue windfalls to be fully allocated to deficit and debt reduction. Furthermore, procyclical fiscal policies should be avoided in all countries. This is of vital importance to ensure fiscal sustainability in preparation for the impact of ageing populations and is fully in line with the revised Stability and Growth Pact. Reviewing public expenditure and taxation so as to improve the quality of public finances would additionally foster economic growth and fiscal sustainability. We also support ambitious structural reforms, which would further contribute to the smooth functioning of Monetary Union and support growth potential and job creation. In particular, improving labour market flexibility to better align wage and productivity developments and facilitating labour mobility would further strengthen the resilience of countries to shocks and ensure their competitiveness. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * Perhaps you have noted that I have mentioned in my introductory remarks an analysis of the situation which is extremely close to the analysis we made in our last meeting, which is not surprising, because everything that we have observed since then has confirmed what we had envisaged in our last meeting. So, I would say that we are very much in the same mood. I will certainly not comment on future decisions. You know that they always depend on facts and figures. We never pre-commit in advance and I will not comment on what could happen in the months to come. I would only say that I would not say today anything that would be aiming at changing expectations for the month of June. Again, I said that we had the same analysis and judgement as we had a month ago. We do not consider that new information has arisen that would change our judgement. Most of the new information we have had – and it is true that it is good – confirms our positive judgement, in particular on the real economy, and we have the same analysis as regards the risks, both for the real economy and for inflation. Again, remember, we never pre-commit in advance. We make a judgement at the moment when we have our meeting and we take the decision to the best of our judgement taking into account all information which is available at that moment. As I said last time, we were calling upon social partners to show a high level of responsibility, taking into account the various situations – and situations are not necessarily the same – in the vast continental economy that is the euro area. There are 318 million fellow citizens. So, we have to take into account the level of unemployment in any particular economy, and it is clear that if one is not satisfied with the present level of unemployment, wage moderation should remain of the essence. We also call for analysing and taking into account the present level of competitiveness, cost competitiveness, of the economy concerned and of the sectors and firms concerned, because this has to be analysed at the level of firms as a last resort. It is the employment in firms that is at stake. So this again is a parameter which is not the same in the various countries. But if you are in a position where there are doubts about your present level of cost competitiveness, then of course wage moderation remains absolutely of the essence. And we trust that it is also important to have a clear understanding of the labour productivity increases, because what ultimately counts is the unit labour cost, and by that I mean the real cost when you take into account the nominal wage increases and salary increases and their combination with the productivity progress. So, these are the three parameters which have to be taken into consideration, on the basis of the figures that exist in the various cases. As a general rule for the full body of the euro area – and I say it on behalf of the Governing Council – we will closely monitor everything that is happening in this respect, because wage moderation remains of the essence if we want, as is absolutely necessary, to preserve the purchasing power of those wages and salaries by delivering price stability. Let us remember that those who are the less well-protected against inflation are the poorest and the most vulnerable in our societies, and this is very important to understand. And by the way, when we preserve price stability, we not only defend the purchasing power of the employees and of all our fellow citizens, but we are also solidly anchoring inflation expectations and preserving a financial environment which is favourable for sustainable growth and job creation. It is also very important to understand that when we call for wage responsibility from the social partners, we are simultaneously paving the way for defending, protecting and preserving the purchasing power of all our fellow citizens and the employees and workers, and we are also paving the way for sustained growth and job creation. On your first question, I would fully confirm that we consider our current interest rates to be on the accommodative side. I said that in my introductory remarks. On the exchange rates, you know that I permanently call upon myself to exercise verbal discipline in this very important domain which we discuss with our major partners in the floating exchange rate system. And we will have a G7 meeting very soon. Between two G7 meetings, we have what has been said in the previous communiqué; a communiqué that we have agreed upon, that I have signed. I will tell you that what is said in that communiqué remains valid until we have a new discussion, and you know that I never say in advance what I will say in our future discussion. I reserve that for the discussion itself. At this moment in time, let me only say that we all agreed in Essen that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth. We also said that, in emerging countries with large and growing current account surpluses, especially China, it is desirable that the effective exchange rates move such that the necessary adjustment will occur. We all agreed on that, and it is my own sentiment because I signed it. And I also said after some comments made by Minister Omi and Governor Fukui that we believe that the Japanese economy is on a sustainable recovery and that the exchange rate should reflect these economic fundamentals. I said that because they had said precisely that, and I said that I shared the view that had been expressed by the Governor of the Japanese central bank and the Minister of Finance of Japan. So, all this was agreed upon in Essen, and I am now preparing to participate in the next G7 meeting in Washington. As regards M3, I would say that, as you know, we look at the monetary pillar with a view to understanding as much as possible the complex dynamics that underlie it. We have M1, we have M2 minus M1, we have M3 minus M2, all of which have different dynamics as far as the components of M3 are concerned. We have counterparts that we look at regularly. I regularly comment on the dynamics of the counterparts, and – as I have said – we see different dynamics in this complex environment where we have increased short-term rates, where long-term rates remain low in historical terms, and I cannot deny that the dynamics of M3, in particular, remain very impressive – 10% is higher than the 9.9% that we had last month. I have also to note that M1 has a much lower rate of growth, but remains at a level of growth which is dynamic – 6.6% this time, versus 6.5% in the last month. We even see a little picking-up. As regards the counterparts, I said that loans to the private sector were a little bit less dynamic – the current growth is 10.3%, compared with 10.6%. We see some slowing down, but it remains extremely dynamic. The increase in lending to households has remained at the same level, at around 8%, and I have very often commented on the loans to non-financial corporations. Such lending is declining, but the level of growth is one of extreme dynamism, because it stands at 12.6%, compared with 13.2% last month, so there has been a downturn. So, we are seeing forces that move these various entities. We look at the overall situation carefully on a broad basis as you see and try to extract that information that is pertinent for us. It is clear, as I have said, that on the basis of all plausible measures, we are living in a universe of ample liquidity. This will not surprise any of you because it is exactly what you are told when yourselves talk to professionals. They would say exactly the same. I said that “I would not say anything that would be aiming to change market expectations for the next two months.” And I also said that we are never pre-committed in any respect. First question, we each have our own responsibility. We look at what we ourselves are doing. The fact that the other responsible major central banks, and all other central banks, are doing their jobs within their own respective context and in line with their own responsibility has no influence on us. We do what we have to do, taking into account that we have to deliver price stability and be credible in the delivery of price stability over time. So, I do not have any particular comment on what the United States could do, or could not do. Second point: as I have always said, when we take a decision – which is based on judgement – we are not underwriting any specific model for our economic analysis, which would mechanistically guide our decision. We capture all pertinent information. We look at what our own staff is doing, particularly as regards their projections. We look at what other entities, all pertinent institutions, are doing in order to come to a judgement of our own, a judgement based on our own wisdom, the collective wisdom of the colleagues that sit around the table, the 19 members of the Governing Council. And we also do the same with the monetary pillar, exactly the same. We always take all parameters into account. Exchange rate developments are, of course, one of the elements that we take into account. I have always said that we take all parameters into account. But, in a system of floating exchange rates, we have no other particular remarks to make on exchange rates on top of what I just said. As regards the monetary pillar, I think that, in order to understand the functioning of the monetary pillar, you have to imagine yourself back at the end of 2005 and at the beginning of 2006. You may remember that I said several times that, on the basis of our cross-checking of the economic analysis and the monetary analysis, we had judged it to be time to increase rates. I remember that, at the time I said that here, we had a great deal of good advice from major international institutions, from a lot of economists, a lot of advice telling us not to do that, saying that it was premature, that we should not move our rates. But we did it nevertheless and the monetary pillar played an important role in our decision. Everybody in this room knows that we have been fully vindicated for what we did at that time in December 2005, and then in 2006 and at the beginning of 2007. So, if you want to understand how the monetary pillar functions, you have to understand that it plays its role – we have the economic analysis and we have the monetary analysis, we have the cross-checking and we have the judgement that we make on the basis of the best of our own collegial deliberations. I think it functions pretty well. I think I have said all that I had to say on exchange rates and on the yen in particular. I stick to what I have said. Thank you very much indeed. On the first question, I would say that there was no discussion on an increase in interest rates today, and as always, we weighed up the pros and cons associated with various possibilities. There was a unanimous agreement. What I said in the introductory remarks captures the unanimous sentiment of the college. But again, a lot of discussions, a lot of views exchanged, as always. As I have said, we rely upon collegial wisdom. Each of us – the 19 – fully accept that other colleagues may have good arguments – may have good analyses – that are worth being examined and incorporated in this collective collegial wisdom that I have to express as the spokesman. As regards Germany, we have noted – not only for Germany but, more broadly, at the level of the euro area – that a number of indicators confirm what we believed to be the case, namely that we were in a process where growth continued to be there at the beginning of this year. In that sense, we are confident that our analysis was a good one. We will have to look at our new staff projections when the time comes – in June – and we will see, then, where we stand. At the present moment, what I see is that there is very much a convergence on the estimates. To the extent that they are suceeded in time, all the new estimates are quite close. As you know, we now have the estimate for the euro area by the IMF, which I have compared with our most recent staff estimates. We are close. Of course, our own bands encompass the IMF’s estimate, which, if I am not mistaken, is 2.3% for 2007 – 2.3% for 2008. We ourselves have said 2.1%-2.9% for 2007 and 1.9%-2.9% for 2008. As I always say they are, of course, the staff projections. Germany is the largest economy in the area. Germany had very flattering growth last year and seems to be continuing to record significant growth even in the first quarter. We will see. Of course, I remain very prudent, but the information that we have had up until now is quite encouraging. What I have just said has been said by all international institutions. And I have also noted that according to the IMF, for 2007 growth in the euro area is extremely close to growth projected in the United States and extremely close to growth projected in Japan. It is the first time for a very long period of time that we are so close: the IMF says 2.3%, 2.2%, 2.3%. I will confirm what I said, perhaps when responding to one of your own earlier questions. At this stage we do not believe that we can conclude with sufficient certainty that there has been a change in total factor productivity or in labour productivity that would permit us to say that the growth potential is higher than before. We think that what we are observing as regards labour productivity might be linked to the cycle, and we are looking at it very carefully because it is a very important parameter for us of course. At the present moment, no, I cannot tell you that in our judgement we have to revise the growth potential for the euro area upwards. But we are looking at that, and we are working on better understanding the dynamics of labour productivity. You are absolutely right, Sir. You know that when I mentioned the risks that we had in front of us, coming from the international environment, I mentioned explicitly the possible rise of oil. I also mentioned explicitly the possible unwinding of global imbalances. I would say it is a way to sum up the risks that we see in the international arena, including, of course, the risks that are embedded in global finance. And this is not new, because I already said that we believe that there are in global finance a level of spreads, a level of volatility, a level of low long-term rates, a level of pricing of risks in general in the global economy that would not necessarily be sustainable in the medium and long run. There is a risk of disorderly correction of this situation, which is, again, associated with the disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. So we have to look at it very carefully. Financial stability is a very important element and you are absolutely right to mention it. We have responsibility in this domain, together with a number of other institutions and partners. This has been looked at, as you know, at the level of the G7/G8 and work has started, including at the level of the Financial Stability Forum, to update the previous study on highly leveraged institutions and it includes the hedge fund issue that you have mentioned and other highly leveraged institutions. It is part of a more global analysis. It also includes a better understanding of what was behind the explosion of derivatives in general, the explosion of the volume of funds that are highly leveraged. What is very important for us central bankers is that the necessary adjustment takes place progressively, orderly and not sharply and abruptly, and this is true in this domain as well as in all others. We will see when the time comes. I am a little bit surprised because I do not see that we have sent a message of that sort. What we are telling Romania is that we encourage Romania to reform as efficiently as possible. I think that Romania has made a lot of important accomplishments over the last years and it was a milestone when Romania entered into the European Union in January 2007. We have noted that Romania had a very good year in 2006, with a number of economic results that were quite flattering. We also believe that there is no room for complacency because the convergence process is certainly a very important one and very ambitious one, taking into account the starting point. We encourage Romania in all respects to continue to work very actively on its own reforms and its own convergence. But I will not say that we are ourselves communicating a precise date. I would say that Romania is welcome when Romania is ready. Again, I do not remember any such message being sent by our institution. Our own message is very simple. “Bravo for what has been done until now, but a lot of work remains to be done, so it is no time for complacency. Continue working very actively to converge and the more rapidly you converge, the better of course for Europe as a whole, for Romania in particular and, when the time comes, for the euro area.” On the first point, I have already commented on exchange rates and I have no further comments. On the second point, the process of setting up the euro area according to the Maastricht Treaty, which was signed and ratified by our democracies, was based on a concept of benchmarking. We benchmarked the economies that were performing less well against the economies that were performing best, according to the various Maastricht criteria. You remember that the Maastricht criteria are very much based upon benchmarking on monetary stability, benchmarking on low levels of inflation, benchmarking on low levels of long-term interest rates. This process has been followed by all those who are currently inside the euro area, and that is why I am able to say here to you that our currency is as credible, is as confidence-inspiring and has the same degree of solid anchoring of inflationary expectations over the next 5, 10, 20, 30 or 50 years as was the privilege of the best national currencies before the euro. It is precisely because we benchmarked the full body of the euro area on this level of credibility and of confidence. This process should continue in exactly the same fashion, for the benefit of the newcomers and, of course, in order to preserve the credibility that we have accumulated over the last eight years. And while we are speaking of the eight years since the euro was introduced, let me remind you that more than 12 million jobs have been created in the euro area since the euro was set up on 1 January 1999. During the eight years before the euro was set up, less than three million jobs were created in the euro area. I am not saying that the euro has created jobs, but those who say that the euro plays against job creation are not confirmed at all by the figures at the level of the euro area as a whole. If I take the example of one particular country – I could take many of them – the case of France: since the euro was created, around two million jobs have been created in France during those eight years. In the eight years before the euro was created, there were less than 500,000. I am not suggesting that you now have a magic wand and you say: “The euro is there, you create jobs”, but let us be aware of the facts and figures, as always. I think it is an important point. It is not the only thing to improve; we have to continue improving our instruments of measure. As you know, we are not responsible for that computation, it is done at the European level by Eurostat. I would only say that, to my knowledge, work is always ongoing on improving the instruments of measure. I think that Axel is right in this respect. We have already an instrument that we believe to be a very good one. There is an overwhelming sentiment that this is a very good instrument. It could be improved more, and better harmonised. It could also be improved at a global level, because we have still significant differences on a transatlantic basis and at a global level. Do not over-interpret that. In any case, as I said, we did not change our own overall analysis in comparison with last time. The fact that we are in a mode of robust growth is evidently something that we take into account as an element which creates an environment for risks that is different from what you would have if growth was not that robust. And again, I have said how we had been vindicated for our own judgement in December 2005. It was very much based on our understanding of the dynamics in the real economy and they have been confirmed in the most recent period of time. "
2007-03-08,Trichet,"Q&A on TARGET2-Securities Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Mr Steinbrück, President of the ECOFIN Council, and Commissioner Almunia. At today’s meeting, we decided to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was taken in view of the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. Today’s decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards fostering sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. After today’s increase, given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ECB interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. The Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Turning first to the economic analysis, according to Eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real GDP in the euro area for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 0.9%, which was above previous expectations. Our current assessment is that the quarterly profile of real GDP growth is likely to be somewhat smoother in response to the impact of indirect tax changes in one large euro area country than had originally been anticipated. The strength of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter is thus indicative of ongoing robust growth in the euro area. Both domestic demand and exports made significant contributions to real GDP growth, confirming the sustained and broad-based nature of the current expansion. The information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued into 2007. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. The conditions are in place for the euro area economy to grow solidly. As regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust, supported in part by lower oil prices. External conditions thus provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. This outlook is also reflected in the new ECB staff macroeconomic projections. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.1% and 2.9% in 2007 and between 1.9% and 2.9% in 2008. In comparison with the December Eurosystem staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2007 and 2008 have been revised upwards, largely reflecting the strength of GDP growth in the second half of 2006 and the lower energy prices, which, if sustained, would have a positive impact on real disposable income. In the Governing Council’s view, the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At longer horizons, risks lie mainly on the downside. The main risks relate to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in February 2007, unchanged from January 2007. The fall in headline inflation rates since the summer of 2006 has been predominantly due to lower energy prices. Looking ahead, last year’s volatility in energy prices will lead to significant base effects, affecting the profile of annual inflation rates this year. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall during the spring and summer before rising again towards the end of the year and then most likely hovering again at around 2%. The new ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual HICP inflation averaging between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2007 and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 2008. Compared with the December 2006 Eurosystem staff projections, the upper bound of the range projected for inflation in 2007 is somewhat lower, largely reflecting the fall in oil prices. By contrast, the projected range for inflation in 2008 is slightly higher, largely on account of the anticipated stronger economic growth, which could exert more intense pressure on factor utilisation and factor costs. In this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including market expectations for future short and long-term interest rates as well as for oil and non-energy commodity prices. At the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains, in the Governing Council’s view, subject to upside risks. These relate to the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. In this context, wage agreements should take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, as well as productivity developments. The Governing Council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth was unchanged at 9.8% in January, thus remaining at the highest rate observed since the introduction of the euro. At 10.6%, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also remained strong in January. Strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the upward trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. Meanwhile, in the context of rising mortgage rates throughout the euro area and a slowing increase in house prices in some regions, the growth of household borrowing has shown some further signs of moderation in recent months, albeit remaining at still high rates. Taking the appropriate medium to longer-term perspective for assessing trends in money and credit growth, the latest developments confirm the continuation of a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. The robust expansion of money and credit reflects the accommodative monetary policy stance over a prolonged period of time and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. In an environment of ample liquidity, it points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look through any short-term volatility in inflation rates. The relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of robust ongoing growth in employment and economic activity. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. As regards fiscal policy, there is growing confirmation that the favourable cyclical developments led to better than expected budgetary outcomes in 2006 in a number of countries and in the euro area as a whole. However, updated stability programmes foresee only moderate progress with fiscal consolidation in the coming years. In this respect, some countries’ consolidation targets appear not fully in line with the requirements of the revised Stability and Growth Pact. Risks stem in particular from a lack of well-specified and credible measures, notably on the expenditure side of budgets. Given the favourable economic environment, the Governing Council considers it essential that pro-cyclical policies are avoided in all euro area countries and that sufficiently ambitious fiscal consolidation efforts are made in the countries with remaining budgetary imbalances and/or high public debt outstanding. The opportunity should be seized to attain sound public finances within the programme horizons and by 2010 at the latest in all euro area countries. Fiscal consolidation that is part of a medium-term-oriented, credible and expenditure-based reform strategy would support longer-term output and employment growth and help prepare for the fiscal impact of population ageing. As regards structural reforms, the European Council will discuss the current state of, and future progress in, the implementation of the Lisbon strategy at its meeting which starts today. It is positive to see that reforms and moderate increases in labour costs have helped to bring about higher employment and lower unemployment in recent years, although progress has been uneven across EU Member States. We encourage action to create incentives and structures which support the integration of all groups into the labour market, including those for which employment rates have been relatively low in the past. Reforms of tax and benefit systems should enhance incentives to work and to create jobs. Reducing labour taxes (including social security contributions) and thereby labour costs would support employment, while setting minimum wages at a level not in line with productivity reduces the employment chances of less skilled workers. We fully support policies to improve education and the adoption of technological innovations in order to raise productivity growth. Coupled with initiatives to create a business-friendly environment, such policies would broaden the opportunities of all to participate in an enhanced growth process. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * On the first question, I would say that we were unanimous in taking the decision to increase rates today. On the second question, in the introductory remarks I said very clearly that, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner is warranted in order to ensure price stability. I said that we will monitor all developments very carefully so that risks to price stability do not materialise. You might also have noted that I said that we continue to be on the accommodative side and that interest rates are moderate. Last time I said that they were low. There is a nuance there which speaks for itself. In any case, you know that we are constantly alert. Credible alertness is the essence of what we are doing, because we know that is the reason why our inflationary expectations are very solidly anchored, as everybody can see. So, market participants, investors and savers – all over the world, as well as in Europe – know that we will do everything that is necessary to continue delivering price stability and to be credible in that delivery – and the credibility of that delivery is crystallised in inflation expectations. First of all, what I said speaks for itself. Second, our approach to monetary policy does not operate through some kind of mechanistic approach relying on a concept like neutral rate, output gap or NAIRU. We look, as you know, at absolutely all information, all modelling and all concepts. What we do is, we assess the situation, we make a judgement on the inflationary risks and we do exactly what we believe to be correct in order to counter those risks. We have to permanently make judgements on the inflationary risks in the medium term and we will do whatever we consider necessary to counter inflationary risks. At the present moment, we consider that we continue to be on the accommodative side and that interest rates are moderate. On you last question, no, I am not ready to tell you. On your question about the credit side, we still have very dynamic growth of M3, as we had before. As regards M1 within M3, we see the continuation of a relative moderation, but this is offset by the dynamism of M3 minus M1. So, all things taken into account, we have very high growth of M3. As regards the counterparts, I will only draw your attention to the fact that loans to non-financial corporations are still extraordinarily dynamic at 13.2%, which is even a little bit higher than a month ago. So, we continue to see very strong dynamism. It is in the area of loans to households where we see a slight moderation. As regards your question on wages, you have noted that the sentiment of the Governing Council is that we have to be particularly attentive in this area. Wages are very important for us, as always, because of the risk of second-round effects and, also, because we have to take into account different situations. The situations in the various economies of the euro area are not the same, the present levels of cost competitiveness on the basis of unit labour costs are not the same, the levels of unemployment are not the same and the levels of labour productivity increases are also not the same, not only at the level of the various economies but also at the level of the various sectors. All these parameters have to be taken into account in order to work out, through responsible social partners, an appropriate wage and salary formation that would permit continued reduction of unemployment where mass unemployment is still observed – as we explicitly mentioned – and would be fully in line with what would be appropriate in terms of overall euro area monetary stability. Again, I have already stated regarding your last question that what I said speaks for itself. And my second question is that when we were all in Madrid last year and the financial markets were doing their gymnastics then, you stressed that an appropriate assessment of risk was not the worst thing in the world and that perhaps some valuable lessons were being learnt. We have a similar situation now, albeit with different kinds of contours, and I wanted to see if you might be of a similar sentiment today? I am not sure that I pick up all the subtlety of the second part of your question. Regarding the first question, if I was preparing the market for restrictive moves on our part, I would have said that. I didn’t say that. What I said, again, speaks for itself. It clearly says that we will continue to monitor developments very closely and it also says very clearly that we are inflexible in terms of maintaining credibility in the delivery of price stability. Not only because it is our mandate, not only because it is what the people of Europe demand of us, but also because it is the best way to ensure the sustainability of the present level of growth and job creation. As I said on behalf of the Governing Council, what we do today, what we did yesterday and what we will do tomorrow is to ensure the sustainability of growth and job creation. If we were not in a position to continue to be credible in the delivery of price stability we would hamper growth, we would not contribute to it. Concerning the recent events that we have observed, it is true that the Governing Council of the ECB widely felt – and I would say that it was very largely a consensus, a consensus that I myself have expressed on a number of occasions as the chairman of the G10 group of central bank governors – that we were perhaps in a phase in global finance where risks in general were not necessarily assessed at their real price. This was materialising in the levels of spreads and risk premia and in a number of other considerations, perhaps including low real interest rates. This was our diagnosis. What we have been observing for a number of days has been a certain re-assessment of risks on the upside and across the board and a higher level of volatility. This is a phenomenon that we are following very carefully. It has positive aspects, obviously. It represents a more realistic appreciation of risks in general. It must also of course be monitored very carefully because what is of the essence in our view is that such corrections are orderly and smooth and are not abrupt. All that we do is aimed at having moves that are not abrupt but orderly. Let us not forget that all this takes place in the environment of a global economy that is extraordinarily favourable, as we have already noted. There is a global consensus that world economic growth will continue to be at a very high level, around 5%. This has been the case in recent years, and all the indications that we have – and again I am voicing a global consensus here – are that it continues to be very favourable. In the context of this favourable environment, orderly phenomena of the type I have mentioned could be observed in the period to come. That said, I am not making any prognosis or projections myself and I would say, again, that we have to preserve financial stability in all circumstances, as this is one of our major responsibilities as a central bank. Secondly, you have said that the move from low to moderate and also from “accommodative” to “on the accommodative side” speaks for itself – you’ll have to forgive me if it is not speaking to me – if I took from that that the Governing Council had a consensus that interest rates might be reaching a peak, which is what it does say to me, would I be wrong in that interpretation? Thirdly, we had unions yesterday saying that the ECB’s rate rises and any further rate rises would hamper the development of wage growth – you have said that that is a priority for you. Their claim seems to be that it would dampen consumption growth, which has long been the euro zone’s weak spot. Do you have a response to that? On the first question, what happened was, in some respects, very rapid. I would not say abrupt, but very rapid. You had, in particular, some parameters that were moved in one day, whereas in the previous episode – when you had some kind of re-appreciation of risks and volatility in 2006 – the same levels of corrections took much more time. So, clearly, it tells us that we have to monitor, extremely carefully, what happens. Again, some re-appreciation of risks is welcome; abrupt moves are not welcome. And, again, let us not forget that all this takes place within the framework of a very favourable situation of the global economy. I would echo, on that point, what was said by the US Secretary of the Treasury and by Ben Bernanke, recently. As regards whether or not we are at a peak, I did not say we were at a peak. Concerning your third question, I have already said that by caring for credibility and the delivery of price stability we permit growth to be sustainable. Again, you know that we are the master of the short-term interest rates. The other interest rates – medium and long-term market interest rates – incorporate inflation expectations. If, by any means, we are not credible, higher inflation expectations are immediately incorporated in medium and long-term rates, to the extent that this would reflect our lack of credibility, which is not favourable to long-term sustainable growth and job creation. So, again, we see absolutely no contradiction between price stability and sustainable growth. You give me the opportunity to mention the fact that it is not correct that the Banque de France has said that they would not be in agreement with this reference value. This is not true. There was a research paper with the usual disclaimer saying precisely that it was not the position of the Banque de France. So, I mention that, en passant, because I read, very carefully, an article this morning. Again, it is not true that the Banque de France is behind this so-called criticism. Now, I do not want to add anything to what I have already said on the reference value. You remember that we had a communication when we established the monetary strategy, even before the setting-up of the euro, in 1998. And we had a clarification in 2003. I stick to that, personally. I would not suggest that we would change anything at this stage. Of course the reference value is not an intermediate target, everybody knows that. The reference value is not an intermediate target that we would change regularly every year. We said that in the clarification. We are, of course, as you know – because we organised a colloquium – working a lot on a monetary pillar which has served us very well, as it served very well the central banks before the setting-up of the euro. I was myself the Governor of a central bank which had a monetary pillar and it served us very well because we came after an extremely stimulating period of time, at the highest level of credibility in Europe, as the Bundesbank was and a number of other central banks were. One of the questions I would suggest that you ask yourself is, how is it the case that this monetary pillar served the central banks so well that they delivered price stability and that they were credible in the delivery of price stability? I said myself, on the occasion of the colloquium, to what extent I was attached to the monetary pillar. The Vice-President did that in a very eloquent fashion. Jürgen Stark did that in a very eloquent fashion and I think that this is the response that I will give you. Vice-President: It served us very well The Vice-President said that it served us very well And my second question would be, if interest rates were to be increased once more by 25 basis points, would you characterise the level we would reach then as still accommodative? And a last question, if markets were to price in another rate hike after that press conference, which is very likely, would you be happy with such an outcome? Let me stick to what I have said already. It is not new: since we have been responsible for the currency for now 317 million people – with Slovenia – we have never pre-committed to any kind of medium-term moves. We have never said in advance that we will increase rates every two months, every three months or every four months. We have had no ex ante concept, but we have always said that at any time we will do what is necessary to counter inflationary risks. This was pretty well understood by the market, it was pretty well understood by investors and savers. When we extract information from the financial markets, we have a level of break-even for inflation expectations that is in line with our definition of price stability when you deduct the appropriate risk premia, and it is the same with the surveys that are done. “In line” meaning below or close to 2%, and I won’t clarify more than that. Below and close to 2% is our definition of price stability. So, we are well understood and we are happy with the way we proceed. We believe that we are very transparent. I always make that point known. We display our definition, and we will be judged on the basis of this yardstick. We will continue to operate the way we have done, and it has served us pretty well up to now. But again, there is nothing new in what I have just said. I repeat what I have already said and what has always been understood. On the US economy – I agree of course that it is an important parameter. As I have already said several times when I have had this question, I consider that the diagnosis of the Federal Reserve is a pertinent one, and I would confirm that the present diagnosis of the Federal Reserve is a pertinent one in our eyes. We don’t pretend that we have a better analysis than the Federal Reserve. You know to what extent I consider verbal discipline as absolutely of the essence as regards exchange markets. And so I will refer to what we said after the G7 meeting in Essen. We said – and that is something which I consider has of course been noted by markets in general – that we re-affirmed that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. We also – including myself – were referring to what Minister Omi and Governor Fukui had said; I said that I had noted myself that they said “that they believed that the Japanese economy is on a sustainable recovery path and that the exchange rates should reflect these economic fundamentals”. It was what they had said themselves in commenting on the communiqué of the G7 and I referred to what they had said. I will stick to that to respond to your question. First of all, there has always been discussion among us on the assets and liabilities of all possibilities but there was no discussion of any 50-basis point interest rate increase. So the response to your question is “no”. As regards the overall situation, I have responded to a large number of questions already, as you know. I think the words I have used speak for themselves. Moderate doesn't mean appropriate, moderate doesn't mean equal to something which would not be moderate, and so forth. So take moderate at its face value. Interest rates are, in our view, moderate. I said no. No. You know what counts is the college, the Governing Council. I would draw your attention to the fact that, from time to time, I read analyses that do not at all reflect our own mood. We exchange all possible views. We have a totally frank and open way of discussing. None of us is “blocked” ex ante. We know that the essence of a college like ours is precisely that you exchange views, you compare notes, you compare analyses and you draw out what is the collegial wisdom. I have a profound trust in collegial wisdom. I do not expect that we will have any difficulties at any future meetings. We will reflect very profoundly on the situation. We will continue to be constantly alert. We know what our duty is, and we know that we have to work out a correct assessment of a situation which is, and always is, very complex. I do not foresee any major difficulty to be surmounted in the future. I am absolutely confident. He did not say that. If I read the report correctly, he referred to a probability. But I do not consider Alan to still be a member of the Fed. I think that legally it is not the case! So I stick to what I said. I trust the Fed. We did not discuss this question at all and the Governing Council has full confidence in Nout Wellink. Nout holds a position which he expressed considering his own responsibility at the banking surveillance authority of the Netherlands. I have full confidence in Nout and we will see that this confidence is certainly well-founded. On the first point, we publish ranges; we do not publish mid-points, and you refer to mid-points. It is your own responsibility to extract a mid-point. But we publish ranges and the ranges also capture the uncertainty which characterises all projections. Second, these are not our own projections but the staff projections. They are an important input in our considerations, but they are not the only input and, in any case, we do not underwrite the staff projections. Let me also say that at this stage – at this very moment, speaking on behalf of the Governing Council – we do not consider that we have either sufficient or sufficiently convincing elements to change our previous assessment of growth potential, which is based largely but not exclusively on productivity considerations. We would at this stage not suggest that we consider our growth potential for the euro area to have changed significantly upwards. We expect, of course, in the medium and long run that, if we continue to be steady on structural reforms, we will observe – progressively – something of that sort, but so far, we do not consider it to be documented or substantiated and that we could retain it. As regards your consideration on financial stability at a global level, I have already mentioned that we considered that there were a number of elements at the level of global finance that could progressively be corrected and, in particular, the under-pricing of certain risks I have mentioned. But these corrections should be orderly and not abrupt, which is a permanent concern for those who are responsible for financial stability. I trust the Governing Council of the ECB and other colleagues the world over to take the appropriate decisions, as regards their own responsibility – which is what we all have been doing over the recent period – to maintain the appropriate financial stability to the extent that our monetary policy has an impact on financial stability. That was the last question on the part of the press conference on monetary policy. We will now turn to the part on our decision on TARGET2 Securities.  The Governing Council of the ECB has decided today to move to the next phase in the TARGET2-Securities project, or as we also call it: ""T2S"". We are publishing a press release and the documentation we have considered. There are two main reasons behind our decision. First, we are convinced that the project is feasible. Second, we believe that T2S can be extremely positive for achieving financial integration in the field of securities settlement. This is good news for investors and issuers as it should help to introduce competition across national borders and to reduce settlement fees. This is not a final go-decision. Like in other projects of this kind, at the end of each phase, the decision will be taken whether to move to the next phase. We are now entering a phase called “definition of the user requirements”. In non-technical terms, this is equivalent to the plans an architect would make before building a house. The intention is to draw as much as possible on the market expertise to draw these plans and to have them finalised by the end of this year. We would then hold a public consultation on these user requirements before deciding whether to move to the next phase by early 2008. The Governing Council has also decided on the “piece of land” where the “house” would be built, if I may express it in this way. T2S would be implemented on the TARGET2 platform for real-time gross payments in central bank money. We have taken this decision because we believe that it will allow us to exploit synergies and to deliver the service at a lower cost: up to 20% when compared with building T2S from scratch. The banking industry has indicated to us their “strong support” for us to proceed with this project. European public authorities (ECOFIN, the Parliament, the Commission) have also appreciated that we are undertaking this project. The finalisation of the documents benefited from very useful interactions with CSDs, market participants and public authorities. We have sometimes revised our views as a result. We will continue working in a very open manner trying to make the best out of the valuable knowledge and expertise that exists in the marketplace. I would say that they would, certainly, because the platform itself would be the land, as I said, on which we will construct T2S. We will reflect, of course, on the precise governance. Yes, it means that the new system would be based upon exactly the same platform and the same central banks, but I would not say only the three. Gertrude, could you be more precise? Tumpel-Gugerell: The development team has been joined by the Banco de España. There are four central banks which are ready to develop the platform. Tumpel-Gugerell: We are in a much earlier phase of this project. We are not yet in the development phase, we are in the phase where we have to define the scope of the project and the content of the project, and only then the development will start. We have now offered the feasibility study to the public, and you can see how we have derived the prices, and we think that we can offer competitive prices. Let me also mention the following, because it was said by us to ECOFIN in particular and noted by ECOFIN in the Council conclusions. They noted that the scope of the T2S project is restricted only to the settlement layer of the post-trading activity regarding securities settled in central bank money and that we do not involve custody services, we do not involve asset servicing, we do not involve corporate actions and all other activities which are and remain separate economic activities performed by the CSDs. We are clear on that Gertrude, would you like to respond ? Tumpel-Gugerell: Yes, on the second point – on the issue of market failure: today we have no cross-border market for securities settlement. This is stated by the Commission and this can also be seen in a Commission report. Therefore we think that our facility would open the market to competition – would increase competition – and this seems to be a reason to offer these services. And on the point of consultancy services or independent assessment: the Commission has asked for a number of studies, and there are a number of private sector studies on the issue of lack of competition in these post-trading services. Tumpel-Gugerell: We have come to the conclusion that the project is feasible. We have had a number of contacts with market participants over the past five months, as you are well aware. We had intensive debates. So far the business case has not been challenged, and the task of the next few months is to go into deeper detail. I will also say that I did not see the reflection in the broader media of what was said by the Council itself. It is important to see exactly what was said. The Council recalls that the clearing and settlement of securities transactions is a key area for financial integration in the European Union, where substantial progress needs to be achieved. Second, it welcomes the fact that the Eurosystem shares this aim and has, to this effect, undertaken work on the Target2 Securities project with a view to providing a common settlement engine capable of settling securities in central bank money in euro, and it welcomes the information provided by the ECB on the functioning of T2S through published material and consultations with market participants. It refers to what we have done already. It welcomes, too, the Eurosystem’s intention to take a final decision on the launch of T2S after consideration of a number of issues and completion of feasibility study. Then I have to say that it is not the final decision, as we have said very clearly today that we will incorporate all remarks which are made before we take our decision to launch, which will be taken at the beginning of next year. We are totally open, we are totally transparent, and we firmly believe that something has to be done and that the present situation is not – as Gertrude said – optimal, neither from the competition standpoint nor from the financial integration standpoint, which is very important for us as well as for the Council and the Commission. I will respond to the question on Mr Steinbrück and Gertrude will respond to the other questions. If I remember correctly, Minister Steinbrück went out before we re-discussed this matter, but Minister Steinbrück was present at the ECOFIN Council, as the chair of ECOFIN, and I was also present myself. So, he examined this project on the basis of what we gave to ECOFIN. He was the chair when they drafted the Council conclusions which I quoted just a moment ago. Tumpel-Gugerell: On the monopoly issue, central bank money is a product which can be offered by central banks only, but the possibility of providing the necessary securities for settlement will remain open in the future, because the T2S system will not be mandatory. This has been stated several times already. There is an alternative second channel to get liquidity from market participants, and that is commercial bank money. So, there is perfect competition between two different channels and this would also be the case in the future. Where we do not have competition at the moment is cross-border settlement. And the purpose of the system and the platform is to make cross-border settlement as cheap and efficient as domestic settlement. Regarding the mission creep, most European central banks have performed settlement services in the past, or are still doing so today. Both the Fed and the Bank of Japan offer settlement services as well, so it is not something which is separate from central banking. It is also in line with the Treaty that the European Central Bank may provide facilities in this context. That concludes our press conference today. All the documents will be circulated: the press release on TARGET2 Securities and also the press release on the ECB’s Annual Accounts. Thank you very much indeed for your attention. "
2007-02-08,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our previous decisions to raise interest rates. It has also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. As emphasised on previous occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Our monetary policy remains accommodative, with the key ECB interest rates still at low levels, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail. Turning first to the economic analysis, the latest indicators and survey data suggest that the economic expansion has continued into 2007 and remains solid and broad-based. Looking ahead, while some volatility in the quarter-on-quarter growth rates of real GDP cannot be excluded, the medium-term outlook for economic activity continues to be favourable. Conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to continue to expand at rates around potential. Global economic growth, which has become more balanced across regions, remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, reflecting the benefits of an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also continue to gradually strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as labour market conditions – in particular employment growth – continue to improve. Risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At longer horizons, risks lie mainly on the downside. The main risks relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, it is essential to stress the importance of taking a medium-term perspective and to look through the possible volatility of inflation rates over the course of 2007. In this respect, it may be helpful to consider the potential volatility of inflation in greater detail. In the very short term, it appears that the changes in VAT in a large euro area country were not fully reflected in prices in January. Thereafter, it should be noted that on the basis of current prices for oil and oil futures and previous oil price developments, significant favourable base effects may progressively lead to lower inflation rates in the spring and summer. However, these effects will be temporary. Later in 2007 inflation rates are expected to rise again as a result of unfavourable base effects. The medium to longer-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks. They continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. Furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters, the fact that survey measures of capacity utilisation are approaching the peak levels reached in 2000, and the ongoing improvement in labour market performance. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. In this context, wage agreements should take into account productivity developments while recognising the still high level of unemployment and price competitiveness positions. Indeed, the Governing Council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth rose further to 9.7% in December, marking the largest increase seen since the introduction of the euro. Of course, monthly figures can be volatile and we should not overemphasise short-term developments. However, continued strong money and credit growth confirm the view that the underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area remains vigorous, with no evidence as yet that the steady upward trend observed since mid-2004 has been halted or even reversed. The ongoing robust expansion of money and credit reflects the still accommodative monetary policy stance and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. At 10.7%, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remained strong in December, although showing a slight moderation with respect to the previous month. Strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the upward trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. Meanwhile, in the context of rising mortgage rates throughout the euro area and slowing housing markets in some regions, the growth of household borrowing has shown some further signs of moderation in recent months, albeit remaining at still very high rates. Taking the appropriate medium to longer-term perspective for assessing trends in money and credit growth, the latest developments confirm the continuation of a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Persistent strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is particularly important to look through any short-term volatility. On the basis of today’s assessment, after a possible fall over the spring and summer, inflation rates are likely to increase again later in the year. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments. Given the very strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Hence, we will be strongly vigilant in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. As regards fiscal policy, first indications confirm that fiscal developments in the euro area were relatively favourable in 2006 on the back of strong output growth and revenue windfalls. It is now essential that the momentum of improving public finances is maintained and that the pace of fiscal consolidation accelerates in 2007 and 2008 so that all euro area countries attain their medium-term objective of a sound fiscal position as soon as possible. Better than expected budgetary outcomes in 2006 and possible further revenue windfalls this year should be used for faster fiscal consolidation. Experience has shown that the temptation to relax expenditure restraint, delay necessary reforms or pursue pro-cyclical policies in an upswing needs to be firmly resisted. Fiscal consolidation measures have the best chance of success when they are based on a credible and comprehensive reform strategy, with a focus on reducing expenditure rather than increasing revenue ratios. The Governing Council stressed that progress in the area of structural reforms and moderate increases in labour costs in some countries have been key factors in increasing employment and reducing unemployment over the last few years. Indeed, while still high at a rate of 7.5% in December 2006, the standardised unemployment rate was the lowest since the series began in 1993 and has fallen by 1.4 percentage points since its latest peak in June 2004. To fully exploit the beneficial effects of Economic and Monetary Union and the Single Market, further structural reforms must enhance the adjustment capacity of the euro area. This includes sufficient wage differentiation, especially to improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in regions with high unemployment. It also encompasses more flexible product and labour markets that would give rise to new investment possibilities and innovation. And it requires the removal of impediments to labour mobility – between jobs, between regions and across borders. Let me therefore recall that with Slovenia having entered the euro area, its labour force needs to be granted full access to the labour markets of all euro area countries. Generally, structural reforms, in combination with fiscal consolidation, must support sustainable developments by limiting the burden that is shifted to younger and future generations. Considerable challenges therefore remain, which differ across countries but which all urgently require determined action. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * First, as regards the expression that you cited: it speaks for itself and I have nothing else to say on that. As regards the profile that I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council in the introductory remarks, I draw your attention to the fact that our horizon is medium-term. It is in the medium term that we deliver price stability and that we are credible in delivering price stability. I wanted to make clear that we know in advance, on the basis of present information as regards the price of oil, in particular, that we would probably have a particular profile in the course of 2007, with diminishing yearly inflation rates month after month due to base effects and then a picking-up at the end of the year. This is taking into account present information, and I think it is important that we communicate that. But again, we take all today’s decisions with a view to the medium-term perspective and with a view to delivering price stability in the medium term. My second question regards the risks for inflation in the medium term: you seem to paint toward the upside here, but you note that base effects kick in and lower rates temporarily in the spring and summer, base effects then kick in, in the fall and raise them. You didn’t mention that they are temporary as well, but I assume that will be the case. So as I look toward the risks to inflation that you sketch out here over, let’s say, the next ten months, it’s hard not to come away with the impression that it is wage developments that are the key factors that are going to determine upon which side the risks ultimately fall. So I wonder if you could address that, because you really seem to be singling that out as the key factor here. And my third question: I was wondering if you could tell us – you will be heading to Essen on Friday and Saturday – what message will you take to the G7 on behalf of the Governing Council regarding improving transparency for hedge funds? As regards the profile, we are in the domain of probability, because it depends on a number of parameters that we, of course, don’t have control of, namely the price of oil and of other commodities. On the basis of what we know today, we should normally see a decrease in yearly inflation rates in the months to come and then a picking-up at the and of the year. I will say no more than that. I only warn you in advance, but – as I said – we are no longer focusing on inflation this year. Inflation this year is already done, the decisions we are taking now are to ensure price stability in the medium run. Second, the risks that I listed on behalf of the Governing Council will not surprise you; there is the stronger pass-through of past oil price increases than previously anticipated, and that remains a risk. Past increases in the price of oil are still in the “pipeline”, as are increases in the price of various commodities. We have also the administered prices and indirect taxes which could go over and above what has been anticipated and priced in present projections: our projections, as well as the projections of the market, of the observers and economists. Finally, I think you are right to underline the issue of wages and salaries as a risk: it is clear that we have a message there today. As regards the G7, you know that I have signed all of the G7 communiqués on behalf of the ECB. These are important meetings at the global level with our partners. It is not my own tradition to say a lot of things in advance. What counts is what we discuss and what we agree upon. So I will not say anything in advance. However, you know our position as regards financial stability in general, financial institutions and hedge funds. And I will certainly convey our assessment, which is very clearly expressed in our Financial Stability Review, to the G7. On a personal basis, I am very attached to standards and codes, voluntary standards and codes reflecting the best judgement of the industry itself on what is an appropriate behaviour, and I will certainly also convey this view. This is not new, I already said that. Certainly not, but what was exactly your first question. As far as “strongly vigilant” goes, I repeat what I said earlier, namely that it speaks for itself! Yes, indeed. Secondly, to follow up on my colleague’s question about wages: a number of economists have noted that as the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.5% there might be some inflationary wage pressures in there, but, as much of the job growth has taken place in part-time and contract work, the expected inflationary impact might actually be muted. Would you comment on that? And thirdly, there has been some discussion about whether or not there will be more meetings between the ECB or yourself and those in the Eurogroup. Could you comment on whether this is the case and if so, whether those meetings would be on a formal or informal basis? You had a first question on market expectations. I will not comment on market expectations. I think that our analysis is clear enough to permit markets to make up their mind, and I will not comment more on that. On the second question, it is clear that we, as I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council, have employment growth which is quite substantial. I had the occasion recently to make public some comparisons that were more flattering for the euro area than has been sometimes said. This is particularly the case when you compare the job creation numbers for the eight years after the introduction of the euro with numbers for the eight years before. Orders of magnitude are more than 12 million after, less than 3 million before. And something which is a little bit counter-intuitive, at least in the eyes of a number of observers, is that we have created more jobs in the euro area than in the United States since the introduction of the euro. However, it is not to say that we are living in the best of all possible worlds. We still have unemployment at a high level, a level which is much too high. We have a lot of structural reforms to implement in order to generate more growth and job creation. I would certainly not say that there are elements that would permit us to be more tranquil as regards the influence of wage augmentations on inflation. Our message on the necessity of a high level of responsibility for all social partners, as I have already said, is a strong message. As regards the question of our own relationship, independence and so forth, I think it is important for me to read Article 108 of the Maastricht Treaty. It is really important. “… neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the Member States undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB …” So, that is the Treaty. I am inflexibly attached to the strict implementation of the Treaty. Firstly, because it is the Treaty. Secondly, because it is essential for our credibility. I let you be the judge of what our credibility would be like if we were not independent, and what kind of anchoring of future inflationary expectations we would deliver. Thirdly, because it is the will of the people of Europe. I have already made public at the European Parliament that 73% of our fellow citizens in the euro area approved the sentence “Do you think it is important that the ECB is independent from governments in order to ensure price stability?” – 73%! I have already made that figure public but this is an occasion to repeat it. And fourthly because being credible, being able to deliver price stability as our Treaty requires of us, is a necessary condition for delivering sustainable growth and job creation. We have done that since the very introduction of the euro and we will continue to do that. This is crystal clear. You are absolutely right to say that, when looking at the counterparts of the monetary aggregate and, in particular, when looking at the external counterpart, we can see that there is room for further work to gain a better understanding of what might have happened in this respect. This does not, of course, change the order of magnitude of the most important counterparts that I had mentioned – credit to the economy and in particular credit to the private sector, which is extraordinarily dynamic. It is true that we have to improve our understanding of the dynamics of this “external side of the coin”. I would not jump to a definitive working assumption – as you are suggesting – that it is carry-trade. I'm not sure of that. We have to understand it better. And, again, it doesn’t change the order of magnitude of M3, but it explains part of the jump we have observed in the most recent months. As regards carry trade at the global level, it is clear that we do have that phenomenon – perhaps more visibly for other currencies than for ours – and it is true that it is a phenomenon that is probably also triggered, or fostered, by the low level of volatility that we are currently observing in the global financial markets. We know that this will not last for ever and I have myself said a number of times that I trust that part of the phenomena we are observing today – the low level of spreads, the low level of volatility, the low level of risk premia – are probably characteristic of a transitory period in the financial market, corresponding to an under-appreciation of risks in general. But we would certainly have, over time, an increase in the pricing of risks that will perhaps be more in line with a good and appropriate assessment of risks at the global level. Again, it is not a phenomenon that is particular to Europe. It is a global phenomenon. And then second, on today’s topic: I was wondering whether, if – as lots of people in the market seem to think – ECB rates do rise, next month to 3.75%, whether it would still be appropriate to call the level of ECB rates accommodative, given the general situation in the European economy. On the first question, I have absolutely no reason not to repeat today what I have already said, what I said after Singapore. As regards the second point, I will tell you when the time comes. You are asking for something in advance. As you know, we never pre-commit. Our strategy is known. We have a definition of price stability, which is known, and we always look at the facts and the data. We are always conditional. Therefore I will tell you what would be my response to your question when time comes. And then I have a second question on what you said about inflation. You said the important thing is not inflation this year but that we have to ensure price stability later on, so not only in 2007 but also 2008. So, with this strong underlining of risks of inflation rises, are you sending signals that you are going to revise up your inflation projection for 2008, which was under 2%? Or are you going to revise your growth projection, because growth around potential is not inflationary? As regards your first question, I have already responded to a similar question in the past and I will say the same. First of all we never comment on rumours or anonymous declarations. We never comment on that. Our communication is transparent, crystal clear and public. We have absolutely no concept of anonymous communication in the Governing Council. I repeat: absolutely no concept of anonymous communication. It seems to me that, last time, this anonymous communication proved to be totally wrong. I do not think we need any kind of anonymous communication, it would be stupid. I am here with the Vice-President. We make speeches, we have introductory remarks, and you can follow what we are saying in a very clear way. As President I communicate on behalf of the Governing Council, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the sentiment of the Governing Council. We are public. We are transparent. As regards your second question, I will certainly not tell you in advance because I am absolutely incapable of telling you in advance what our staff will produce as regards projections. We will make those projections immediately public on the occasion of our next monetary policy meeting. You will see, and I will see with you, what the assessment of our staff is. As far as the Governing Council is concerned, it does not underwrite the staff projections but considers that they are an important input among a number of inputs in the economic analysis. Then the Governing Council makes a judgement. We will see what those projections are, both in terms of growth and in terms of inflation, when they are ready. Today, I can tell you that we see inflation risks in the medium term on the upside, as I said earlier. And the second question: you had a meeting with Chancellor Merkel, who is very supportive of the independence of the ECB. What is the meaning for you to have such a meeting, and can you confirm whether you invited her to the meeting? And is it good for you to have such a meeting with the chairman of the European Council? And thirdly on communication, why does the ECB have very successful communication, like today, but it seems to be that the Bank of Japan is somewhat struggling to get good communication. Could you comment on that? First question: I already said that it was not my tradition to say in advance what I will say to my partners when I meet them in the G7. So, I will not depart from this position, which has been my constant position. That being said, I also mentioned the fact that I did not withdraw my sentence after the Singapore meeting on the yen. I will say nothing else but what I have already said. We will have a discussion which I hope will be a very serious and deep discussion, because these are serious and deep issues. Second question: As regards Chancellor Merkel, we were very happy that the President of the European Union had accepted our invitation. With a number of my colleagues I have met all the successive presidents of the European Union, whether here or in their capitals or on the occasion of the European Councils to which I had been invited. It is normal that one of the very important institutions of Europe has contact with the presidency of European Union. As regards your third question, I will respond with a joke, if you permit me. With all colleagues that are themselves governors of central banks, we form a strong brotherhood of mutual admiration. As regards the percentage of counterfeit banknotes, the latest information that I have is that we are in a situation which is of the same order of magnitude as we had before but perhaps even better. From that standpoint, we have a technology which works. We have security features that are state of the art and we are reasonably happy with it. Of course we have to be constantly alert because criminal activities are very ingenious and creative, but at the present time we have every reason to think that the choices we made in the past were good and appropriate ones. As regards the future banknote series, we are working on it and we will incorporate state of the art security features in it. I cannot say anything more, but new security features will be incorporated in the new banknotes when we issue the new series. I might just follow up if I may with a second question about the yen. Perhaps you could help us journalists. We hear comments from European finance ministers suggesting that somehow the yen is too weak; it's being distorted by financial flows. I know this is something of a matter of concern. Listen to voices from the other side of the Atlantic and we’re told that it is a currency being driven by competitive, normal market forces. Could you help guide us as to who is right? Regarding your first question, we never pre-commit to any rate increases, whether at regular or irregular intervals. I never said that we would increase rates every three months when we increased rates in December 2005. On the contrary, I explicitly said that we had not decided ex ante what we would do in the medium run. We decided that it was appropriate to increase rates from time to time. Observers – as lucid and vigilant as you – perhaps concluded that we were increasing rates every three months in the first half of 2006. But it was because we judged that it was appropriate to increase rates at certain times. We were certainly not implementing a pre-defined scheme. Then, for reasons that were entirely due to the risks to price stability that we had identified and the balance of risks according to our final judgement following our two pillars of analysis, economic and monetary analysis, we increased rates every two months in the second part of the year. But again, we did not decide ex ante that we would increase rates every two months. We thought it was appropriate to do that and we are in exactly the same mode. We do what we believe we have to do and, of course, the circumstances are changing, the environment is changing, new data are coming in, such as the good surprise as regards growth last year. Also, rates are now at the level of 3.5% rather than 2%, so we are in a different situation. But we will do what we have to do. Your question addresses what the message of the Governing Council will be on the next occasion and as mentioned previously, I will tell you at that time what I have to say then on the basis of new information, including the staff projections and of our judgement in one month time. As regards the yen, I will stick to what I have already said. I don’t see why I should tell you right now what I will tell our Japanese friends, our US friends, our UK friends and our Canadian friends when we meet in Essen. I stick to what I have already said regarding the yen in Singapore. And secondly, I understand you have no message on currencies to impart to us today, but I have a question about the discussion in general. Given the robustness of the discussion, do you believe there is an implicit threat to the independence of the ECB, or for that matter the Bank of Japan, in all of the euro-yen discussion we have seen? I said, myself, when we increased rates in December 2005 that our judgements on monetary aggregates and our monetary analysis played an important role in triggering these increases in rates. You have to judge not only what we have done today or yesterday but also what we did in the past fourteenth months. I think that what I said on behalf of the Governing Council speaks by itself. Let me mention the December 2006 increase in outstanding loans to non-financial corporation of 13%, which is high, and approximately a little less than three times the growth of GDP in value terms. We take all this information as pertinent and important in our own monetary policy concept, as you know. As regards the exchange rates question – I don’t understand the question linked with the ECB. What would the ECB’s independence have to do with it? I will respond to that question next time! Not at all, because it would be contrary to the Treaty. It is totally out of question; no pressure of any sort. We are living in a floating exchange system. What we are referring to are discussions among partners within the framework of the floating exchange system. It is a system that we know pretty well because it is the system which has existed between these major floating currencies for one-third of a century. We will not rediscover the world in which we are living and have been living for one-third of a century. And I will not comment again on the relationship between the Bank of Japan and the Executive Branch in Tokyo. And the second question, on the relationship of the ECB to the Eurogroup and to the finance ministers: you were quoting the Treaty, saying the ECB shall not take advice from any other Community body. If finance ministers now ask the ECB to act on exchange rates, or when they comment on exchange rates as they are doing right now, do you think they are violating the Treaty, or is that still within the range of the Treaty? First question – we will see what will be in our next projections, and I do not want to anticipate in any respect the next projections – they depend on a number of parameters and on the work that will be done by our staff. We are reserving judgement. I had only mentioned that the profile for inflation would go down and then up at the end of the year. I will certainly not comment on whether it would be over and above 2%, or below 2%, but it will be higher at the end of the year. And in my introductory statement I had mentioned risks. As regards our independence, we are called upon to deliver price stability. The Treaty gives us that as our primary mandate, and we are guided only by this primary mandate. We do not have any exchange rate targets ourselves. We have to deliver what is required by our primary mandate, and we are totally independent as I have said earlier. You mentioned the fact that we cannot receive instructions, or ask for instructions, but the most important information that I gave you was not that. It was that the Treaty stated that the Community institutions and the government, the executive branch, “undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB!” That’s the important message and obligation. No, because it would be beyond the scope of the Treaty and Peer Steinbrück, I must say, gave a speech yesterday that was crystal clear in this respect. Angela Merkel, the Bundeskanzlerin, was crystal clear in this respect. I would say that all governments which have expressed themselves on this particular point, or the overwhelming majority, were crystal clear. This is what the Treaty says and we will be inflexible in respecting the Treaty because it is in the interest of Europe, it is in the interest of sustainable growth and job creation. It is because it is what not only the Treaty but also the people of Europe ask from us. Again, it is the best service we can provide Europe with. I don’t want to go back to the figures I gave you, but those who say that the euro is working against job creation are not justified, when you look at the figures I have mentioned. This is not to say that we are living in the best of the worlds possible. We have a lot of homework to do and even if 7.5% is a better unemployment figure than the previous ones, it is still too high – and we remain convinced of that. Thank you very much for your attention. "
2007-01-11,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our first press conference in 2007. Let me therefore wish you all a very Happy New Year. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Slovenia as the thirteenth country to adopt the euro as its currency. Accordingly, Mr Gaspari, the Governor of Banka Slovenije, became a member of the Governing Council on 1 January 2007. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in December. It has also confirmed that very close monitoring of all developments is of the essence so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Our monetary policy continues to be accommodative, with the key ECB interest rates remaining at low levels, money and credit growth very strong, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. Turning first to the economic analysis, quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the euro area was 0.5% in the third quarter of 2006, after very strong growth in the first half of last year. Domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth, thus confirming the anticipated broadening of the recovery and pointing to the increasingly self-sustaining nature of economic expansion in the euro area. Drawing on the latest information, the evidence from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued and that the situation in labour markets has improved further. While some volatility in the quarter-on-quarter growth rates around the turn of the year may be observed – associated with the impact of changes in indirect taxes in a large euro area country – the information available continues to be in line with our baseline scenario. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity continues to be favourable and the conditions remain for the euro area economy to grow solidly, at rates around potential. As for the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions, with some deceleration in the US and resilient growth elsewhere. Overall, global growth should remain robust and therefore continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. In the Governing Council’s view, the risks surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic growth over the coming years lie mainly on the downside. The main risks relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, and concerns about possible disorderly developments due to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in December 2006, unchanged from the previous month. On account of their volatility over recent months, and owing to base effects, energy prices will continue to play an important role in determining the profile of annual rates of HICP inflation in early 2007, together with the impact of higher indirect taxes. Looking further ahead, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% over this year and next. In the Governing Council’s view, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks, stemming in particular from a stronger than anticipated pass-through of previous oil price increases, increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far, and the possibility of renewed oil price increases. More fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth over the past few quarters and positive labour market developments, wage dynamics could be stronger than currently expected. It is therefore crucial that social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. In this context, wage agreements should take into account productivity developments, while recognising the still high level of unemployment and price competitiveness positions. As stated on previous occasions, it is also important that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms. Turning to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth rose to 9.3% in November. This represents its highest annual rate of growth since the introduction of the euro and, indeed, its strongest aggregate growth in the euro area group of countries since 1990. While the significance of monthly figures should not be overstated, as they may also be influenced by temporary factors, the series of strong monetary data over the past couple of months underscore the continued very dynamic underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area. Rising short-term interest rates, in combination with low long-term interest rates, have exerted only a limited influence over monetary developments in recent months. This has mainly taken the form of shifts among the components of M3 rather than constraining the overall expansion of M3 itself. In particular, over recent months the annual growth rate of M1 has moderated somewhat, reflecting shifts from overnight deposits into other components of M3 that offer more market-related returns. All in all, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the low level of interest rates and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. In particular, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector was 11.2% in November, unchanged from the previous month. While – in the context of rising interest rates – the growth of household borrowing has shown signs of stabilisation in recent months, albeit at very high rates, the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards. Thus, credit continues to expand rapidly and in a broad-based fashion, thereby remaining the main driver of the current strong monetary growth when viewed from the counterpart side of the MFI balance sheet. Taking a medium to longer-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% this year and next, with risks to this outlook remaining on the upside. Given the very strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Hence, very close monitoring of all developments is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. As regards fiscal policy, almost all euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes. While these programmes generally indicate that governments plan to proceed towards sound budgetary positions, there are also indications that budget targets do not consistently imply sufficient consolidation and that concrete and credible measures have not yet been specified in all programmes. These indications are a cause of concern and entail risks for the future. Against the background of current good times, it is essential that sound budgetary positions are reached in countries with fiscal imbalances and that a pro-cyclical loosening is avoided in all member countries. Moreover, countries need to improve the quality of their tax and expenditure policies as part of a comprehensive medium-term strategy, so as to strengthen confidence in a growth and employment-friendly, and sustainable, fiscal policy environment. With regard to structural reforms, over recent years euro area countries have become increasingly aware of the necessity to adjust to the challenges of increased global competition, ageing populations and accelerating technological change. In response, some have undertaken reform efforts to create more job opportunities. Both as a reflection of these reforms and as a result of wage moderation in some countries, the euro area has seen a remarkable dynamism in employment growth over the recent period. Notably, around 12 million new jobs were created in the euro area in the eight-year period since the start of Stage Three of EMU. This compares favourably with the little more than two million new jobs created in the same group of countries in the eight years before 1999. However, the Governing Council notes that significant structural impediments continue to exist and contribute to explaining why unemployment rates are still unacceptably high and participation in the labour market is still low by international standards. With other countries in the world also increasing the competitiveness of their markets, it is essential for each euro area country to minimise the market distortions induced by its particular regulations and for the euro area as a whole to remove remaining barriers to market integration. This requires the implementation of comprehensive reforms necessary to deepen market integration, soften labour market rigidities and improve wage flexibility in order to continue fostering growth and new employment opportunities. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * You have been very observant in noting that I used that sentence, which is very close to what I had said in December, and my statement also holds true of other parts of our overall assessment and judgement. You will also have noted, perhaps, that I did not use the words “strong vigilance”. I will let you draw the appropriate conclusions from these observations. As far as we are concerned, it must be said that we are very much in the same mood, and that we came to very much the same judgement as that we had made last December. In this regard, it is not surprising that the wording of the introductory statement is quite close to that used in December. I have always said that we never pre-commit ourselves on a medium-term basis. We never pre-commit ourselves to doing, or not doing, something in two months, in three months, in four months, in five months and so forth. We are of the opinion that we have to assess the situation, make our judgement and do what is necessary to ensure price stability. You are right in noting that we have said that acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability is warranted, something which is certainly important. You have also noted that we also said that we were in a situation in which close, very close, monitoring was warranted. That is clear on its own. I would not say anything here that would change expectations in the market that we could do something at the end of the first quarter. I would certainly not say anything that would contradict that. It seems to me that the expectations have has not necessarily been made on the basis of what I say on behalf of the Governing Council, but rather on the basis of the figures that are available, the facts that are given and the assumptions made. Everybody knows, because we are totally transparent, that we have to deliver price stability in line with our definition, namely a rate of inflation that is below 2%, close to 2% but less than 2% over the medium term. That is total transparency which everybody can appreciate. And, a separate topic altogether: I was wondering if you could comment on whether there are basic qualifications among Eurosystem banks for central bank governors, and on what your opinion might be on Poland’s nomination yesterday? As I have said, we have made an assessment that comes down to very much the same judgement, the same appreciation of the situation that we had in December, so that you should not be surprised that the introductory statement is similar. Second, we had a great deal of information at our disposal, and these bits of information very much confirmed our baseline scenario and very much confirmed what I said last time with regard to the overall projections we have in mind. That having been said, we are observing some parameters that also have an influence in the short run, of course, on the CPI, and these include the oil prices. Once again, you know that we are reasoning over the medium term, that we consider the medium term. As to your question on Poland, our position is very clear – it was made public - that it is essential to fully ensure the independence of the central bank. And everybody knows we attach the utmost importance to the Treaty provisions being fully respected in this regard. This has also been said by other institutions. I am not saying anything on top of what I already said on future decisions. It is up to each of us to have in mind what it would mean taking all into account. I don’t want to confirm anything except what is in the market as regards future probability which, as I said, doesn’t seem to me aberrant on the basis of the present level of information. Secondly, I noticed that your analysis of the global scenario is a bit more nuanced than before with the detail of deceleration in the US and resilient growth elsewhere and wonder if you could say whether that reflects a more nuanced understanding of the Governing Council’s discussion on the global economy. On the first point: we did not change our communication strategy at all. We have always been extraordinarily keen on not pre-committing on a medium term basis. We never said that we would maintain rates at a certain level for a “considerable period of time”. We never said that everybody could expect an increase of rates every meeting, every two meetings or every three meetings. We always reserved the possibility to judge and assess the situation in line with our definition of price stability and our monetary policy concept. As regards the moves, the next moves or non-moves, it’s true that we try to be reasonably predictable, but never pre-committing. It’s a question of appreciation of probability. It’s true that we are happy to be predictable and we have been highly predictable according to all research that has been made. What is also true is that some observers had noted that in the second half of last year we increased rates every two months. It didn’t mean that we had pre-committed ourselves to increasing rates every two months. We never said that and we never pre-committed but the situation was such that we judged that it was appropriate. At that moment in time you refer to we slightly changed our message. Our message was: don’t forget we do what is necessary, what we judge appropriate to ensure price stability. We are not stuck with a regular automatic piloting. And this is fully in line with what we had always said, fully in line with our constant way of handling monetary policy and communication. And this time, I am telling you again exactly this: we are not pre-committed, we will do what will be necessary and I even went a little bit further in saying that I didn’t see the necessity to change present expectations as regards probabilities as regards the future. Again, we will do what is necessary and we decide when we meet, that’s absolutely clear. As regards global growth there is no real change in our understanding of the situation. We have the sentiment that global growth is still very encouraging. We believe that what is likely to happen this year looks encouraging, of the order of magnitude of what has been observed last year. I think that the Fed has been vindicated, that the slowing-down in the US would be an orderly slowing-down and certainly not a sharp and abrupt slowing-down, this is recognised now quite well by observers on the basis of facts and figures. All the information we have is that the developing world, the emerging world, the world in transition are doing quite well and are likely to continue to do so. This does not mean that we have no risks, we have risks and those risks are clearly on the downside. These are low-probability risks but grave risks. I would mention three major risks that the Governing Council sees at the present juncture, the rise of protectionism, the possibility of oil price increases and the possibility of disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. Secondly, I am just confused a bit about what you have been seeing about M3 and the monetary analysis. You had a conference last year in which you emphasised the importance of this pillar and the importance of monetary developments and in your statement today you say maybe it’s a one-off, we shouldn’t read too much into monthly figures, but point to an underlying strength and there are also worries about the liquidity at the global level. Yet somehow, it doesn’t seem to have had a bearing on your decision-making. Hence, I rather think that this might increase speculation about more action being required down the line, maybe 50 basis points in March, which some people seem to be speculating about now. I will certainly not comment on anything of the kind of the quantum of rate increases, at a certain period of time. I will confirm to you that we are very attached to the monetary pillar, we even organised a colloquium which was attended by a wide range of knowledgeable and remarkable practitioners and academics. We explained why we consider that the monetary pillar had served us very well. I said myself that, in my own understanding, the monetary pillar helped us considerably in three crucial moments in our own decision-making and so I would certainly confirm to you that again, the Governing Council considers that the monetary pillar has served the Council very well. As regards the figures I mentioned today, it’s true that we are working to understand better whether some observations that are explaining the jump in M3 are of a transitory nature or of a non-transitory nature. But as you know what we extract from all information is the trend and a medium-term sense of what is going on, and the sense of what’s going on is extremely clear, we continue to have a great dynamism, observed for a long time and which explains in part, of course, why we have embarked on our interest rate increase against many advices that we received at the time, in December 05. You remember that the OECD was advising us not to move, that the IMF was advising us not to move, that a number of market participants were giving us the same advice. We decided to move, we are now fully vindicated. The monetary pillar played an important role in this decision. The figures we have today, as I said, are very dynamic, I will give you on top of what I already said only one figure, the loans to the non-financial corporations in the euro area which are augmenting at a rate of 13.1% according to the last figure we have. Of course, you have in this increase, outstanding loans and the likely influence of dynamic private equity loans and of a number of M&A operations. We regard this information as important and it explains why, as I clearly indicated, we are in a posture, like we were last month, of very close monitoring, why we consider that acting in a firm and timely manner is of the essence. I will certainly not comment on Bank of England decisions, which I’m sure are excellent decisions in the context of the UK. I never comment, as you know, on Fed decisions either, which I trust are excellent when taking into account all information that the Federal Reserve has. As far as the Governing Council is concerned, we consider it extremely important to keep our options permanently open and never to pre-commit in the medium term. We consider that, unless there are exceptional circumstances, a reasonable level of predictability is not to be rejected. But it’s a question of probability; it’s never a question of 100% certainty and I do not exclude the possibility that we could surprise the market. That is clearly what a central bank must be able to do. But, at this stage and in the present circumstances, I think the rather high level of predictability that we have as regards decisions that are taken on the very day of the meeting – is appropriate for us. And then I have a second question: You are quick workers here in the ECB. Have you already got any information about the profit or loss you made last year from your balance sheet and, if yes, could we know it please? You know that I had the same question in the European Parliament recently, and the response is very clear. Since 1 January we have been responsible for price stability in 13 countries. There are probably – at the moment we speak – more than 315 million people in the euro area including Slovenia; and it is for these more than 315 million people that we have to deliver price stability. We have always explained that we cannot take into account any particular situation, but we have to take into account the situation of the euro area as a whole, in the same way the Federal Reserve takes into account the situation of the US as a whole and not of South Carolina, Alaska, California or Florida in particular. There are big differences as well – as in Europe – in the USA as regards growth, inflation, evolution of unit labour cost and so forth. I will also say that the independence of the central bank is in the Treaty. A fundamental decision was taken by the European citizens in this respect. Responding to a question by a Member of the European Parliament, I said that independence of the central bank was decided in each democracy in Europe according to national rules, and in particular in France. But France is only one example because you mention France yourself in your question; I mention France only as an example of what has happened in all countries. In France, for example, at a joint meeting of the Upper and Lower Chambers at Versailles, it was decided, with a qualified majority of 3/5, to change the Constitution of the 5th Republic in order to permit the independence of the central bank. This was done in 1992, so it’s a decision which was taken a long time ago – very solemnly – and on the basis of a bi-partisan consensus: all major sensitivities had called for the approval of this decision. So my response to your question is “No”, absolutely not, we are only taking into account the situation of the full body of the euro area and not of any particular country. I have also mentioned – and this is something that has to be known – because from time to time, and not only in one particular country but here and there, we have some teasing about the euro and job creation since the start of the EMU. In fact, job creation has been so flattering with around 12 million new jobs created since 1999 compared with only 2 millions job created in the 8 years preceding stage III of the EMU. This speaks for itself and I do not want to add anything. I also said that to the European Parliament. As regards our profit and loss it is very likely we will post a profit which will go to a reserve position in order to permit us to face up possible future challenges. We will publish all the precise figures we are computing now. My second question is: Since you outlined your working hypothesis for the effect of the German VAT increase – I think this was at the Paris meeting in October – you have stuck to a very confident line that this will maybe have a one-time tick in the figures but things will return normal. I just wanted to ask if you could give us a sense of the Governing Council’s feelings on this – on how confident you are of this assertion because it is hard not to read the utterances of the last four or five months as an indication of rising confidence that the German VAT will have a very brief effect and then we will go on with the base- line scenario you have outlined. On you first point the sentiment of the Governing Council is that the balance of risks to price stability is on the upside. Of course it is a balance, and you have a certain probability that things could also improve a little bit. I certainly don’t exclude that, particularly as regards the price of oil and of commodities. But, taking everything into account and with all due taking into account for the various probability distributions, we consider the balance of risks to be on the upside; that is absolutely clear. On the VAT, just as the Fed has been vindicated by facts, figures and its own assessment of what was likely to be observed in the US as regards the conjuncture –as we ourselves were vindicated in respect of our judgement at the end of 2005 and in 2006 on what was going on – all the information we have until now more or less confirms that the reasonable assessment we had on the VAT impact on the German economy and, of course, on the economy of the euro area as a whole was probably well-founded. But we will see; we have to remain totally pragmatic and humble when faced with facts and figures. But until now I see nothing that would contradict these views. And a second question on the recent oil blockade: do you feel that the unreliability, or perhaps increasing unreliability, of suppliers will augment or heighten inflationary risks? On the second question, we are clearly experiencing an episode where volatility is high and we have several illustrations of that. We nevertheless have to have a methodology – and I am speaking for us as well as for all other institutions – to incorporate these prices as parameters that are going up and down, and we are bound to freeze them at a certain level for our own projections. We also have to recognise, even if we do not have any other objective possibilities but to take future prices in account that these future prices are not a good predictor. We all know that and that adds up to the current uncertainty. As regards your question on the counterparts of M3, one of the great advantages of our own methodology with the two pillars is that, when we look at the monetary pillar, we are bound to try to understand as thoroughly as possible the dynamics of all components, and not only M3 alone. This is a very complex dynamic in an environment where we have increased short-term rates – with long-term rates remaining at a very low level in Europe and throughout the world – and that creates different dynamics between M1 and M3 minus M1 in particular. We also are analysing the counterparts, and we have to understand what is happening at the level of the counterparts, and what is behind the different dynamics that we are observing. As regards credit to households, we see some kind of stabilisation at a high level. As regards the corporate sector we see a continuation of a very great dynamism of credit. There is a lot of meditation in the Governing Council on what is behind these developments. Taking all things into account, it is clear that, for us, it signals series of risks in the medium to longer term. And secondly, there have been some comments from the central bank governor of the UAE earlier today suggesting that the Gulf Arab currencies might look towards re-pegging their currencies away from the dollar towards a basket of currencies, or a free-float Does something like this fit in with resolving global imbalances, and do you see that as a helpful step at all? As regards the most recent figures, they are fully in line with our own projections and understanding, and there is nothing in them that would lead us to modify our understanding of what happened last year and what is likely to happen this year. At the European level, last year was very good, because the first semester in particular was exceptionally good: obviously, the second semester was a little less dynamic, but overall as an average, it makes for a very flattering year. In the present year, the conditions remain for the euro area economy to grow solidly at rates around potential, so, at this stage, we do not project the exceptionally high levels of growth that were observed last year, but we consider that we have sustained growth at rates around potential. We will see what happens, but to answer your first question, clearly, we are fully in line with our previous understanding of the situation and the projections. As regards the UAE’s declaration to which you refer, I did not see it, and I will not comment on it. Anyway – even if I had seen it, I would not have commented on it! I will only say that we are not campaigning ourselves for the international use of the euro. We do not discourage it, but we are not campaigning for it either. We let all participants and institutions assess the situation for themselves. Thank you very much for your attention. "
