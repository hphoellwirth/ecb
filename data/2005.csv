2005-12-01,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after two and a half years of maintaining rates at historically low levels. Our decision to increase interest rates was warranted so as to adjust our accommodative monetary policy stance, while taking into account the risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis, cross-checked by our monetary analysis. Our decision will contribute to keeping medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth in the euro area. In fact, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum continue to remain very low in both nominal and real terms. Thus, our policy remains accommodative and continues to lend considerable support to sustainable economic activity and job creation. We will continue to monitor closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Recent data and survey evidence indicate that economic activity has strengthened in the second half of this year. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, real GDP growth was 0.6% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2005, after 0.3% in the first and 0.4% in the second quarter. Moreover, the information on business confidence broadly remains consistent with continued economic growth towards the end of the year. Looking ahead, on the external side, ongoing growth in global demand should support euro area exports, while on the domestic side, investment should benefit from continued favourable financing conditions and the robust growth of corporate earnings. Private consumption should grow broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income. At the same time, the outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks, relating mainly to higher than expected oil prices, concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence. This assessment is broadly consistent with the December 2005 Eurosystem staff projections. Euro area real GDP is projected to grow at rates of between 1.2% and 1.6% in 2005, and between 1.4% and 2.4 % in 2006 and 2007. Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a similar picture. In comparison with the September 2005 ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 have been revised slightly upwards. Turning to price developments, recent increases – mainly in energy prices – have lifted headline inflation rates to levels significantly in excess of 2%. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in November 2005, compared with 2.6% and 2.5% in the two preceding months. It is likely that annual HICP inflation rates will remain elevated in the short term. In interpreting current inflation rates, it is important to make a clear distinction between temporary, short-term factors, on the one hand, and factors of a more lasting nature, on the other. In that respect, it is of crucial importance to take a strictly forward-looking perspective, which does not allow much comfort to be drawn from the current, comparatively lower rates for measures of inflation that exclude certain components, such as energy or certain categories of food. Such measures of “core” inflation have, at least in the past, been shown to lag behind, rather than lead, the developments in headline inflation. In addition, the increase in energy prices to a large extent reflects higher global demand for energy. While it is difficult to quantify precisely this effect, it would appear inappropriate to exclude energy from the price index and at the same time retain other items, such as internationally traded manufactured goods. Owing to the same forces of globalisation, these goods currently exhibit little upward movement in prices and even suggest a downward trend. All in all, in line with our monetary policy strategy, a comprehensive and forward-looking analysis is warranted of the main underlying developments driving the outlook for price stability. This comprehensive assessment encompasses the information contained in various measures of inflation. An important input into our analysis is provided by the Eurosystem staff projections. The projections indicate average HICP inflation to lie between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2005, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2006. These results constitute an upward revision to the ECB staff projections of September 2005. They mainly reflect that the effects of the statistical treatment of the 2006 health reform in the Netherlands are no longer expected to distort the inflation figures for 2006. For 2007 an average inflation rate of between 1.4% and 2.6% is projected. Underlying these projections is the assumption that wage increases will remain contained, as has been the case over recent quarters. Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture. In the view of the Governing Council, the main scenario for price stability emerging from the economic analysis remains subject to upside risks. Such risks relate to uncertainties arising from oil market developments, the pass-through of previous oil price increases to consumers via the domestic production chain, the possibility of second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour, as well as further increases in administered prices and indirect taxes. Evidence pointing to increased upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term comes from the monetary analysis. Liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. The strengthening of monetary growth observed since mid-2004 has gained further momentum over the past months. Growth in the monetary aggregate M3 has been driven by its most liquid components, confirming the increasingly dominant impact of the low level of interest rates. Furthermore, the growth of borrowing – especially mortgage loans – remains very robust. In this context, price dynamics in a number of housing markets need to be monitored closely. To sum up, increased risks to price stability identified by the economic analysis have been cross-checked with the monetary analysis. An adjustment of our monetary policy stance was therefore warranted. Today’s decision will contribute to keeping medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability. Keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability will permit monetary policy to continue to make a significant contribution towards a sustainable recovery in economic growth and job creation in the euro area. To this effect, we will continue to monitor closely all developments relevant to the medium-term outlook for price stability. As regards fiscal policies, euro area countries are now finalising their 2006 budgets and stability programmes. Plans to foster sound public finances and to undertake fiscal reforms that boost economic growth and prepare for the challenges related to population ageing in some countries are welcome. However, in countries with fiscal imbalances, the speed of consolidation is disappointingly slow and there is a high risk that commitments are not being met. It is, therefore, essential that fiscal consolidation is prioritised again as part of a comprehensive and growth-friendly reform programme. This would build confidence in the proper functioning of the Stability and Growth Pact and be the best way in which fiscal policies in the euro area can underpin economic growth. With respect to structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomed the 2005-2008 Lisbon National Reform Programmes that were submitted by EU Member States in October and November 2005, in line with the renewed Lisbon Strategy. These programmes present key country-specific challenges and structural reform measures to increase growth and employment. A parallel Community Lisbon Programme was adopted by the Commission in July 2005 to complement the national programmes with actions to be taken at the European level. Taken together, the programmes show a welcome political commitment on the part of the Member States and the Community, which could give renewed impetus to the implementation of structural reforms. To this end, it is important to match ambitious objectives with concrete policy measures and take new reform initiatives, and to monitor, evaluate and communicate the reform process effectively. Achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy is critical in the face of the triple challenge of accelerating globalisation, rapid technological change and ageing populations. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  On this point I will be very clear. There is not an “ex ante” decision of the Governing Council at today’s meeting to engage in a series of interest rate increases. We have decided to increase rates by 0.25 percentage point because we judged that, with this new level, we are in line with our duty, our mandate, which is to preserve price stability and to be credible over time in preserving price stability. It is our responsibility vis á vis the 311 million people in the euro area, our fellow citizens. It is our duty because it is what the Treaty is calling for. And it is the best way to anchor inflationary expectations. We will see, then, what the new information, the new facts and the new figures are that will permit the Governing Council to make a judgement and take new decisions. We are not engaging, ex ante, in a series of interest rate increases. And, as I have said, we will continue to monitor closely all developments with regard to risks to price stability. As regards your first question to the extent that the short-term market rates had already anticipated our today’s move this move was incorporated in the Eurosystem staff projections. As regards the various voices that you mention, I will only say that we are fortunate to live in a lively set of democracies. We are fortunate to live in a European democracy which is itself lively. I myself, as you know, recently addressed the European Parliament. And I would mention, en passant, that I address the European Parliament as frequently as my colleague Alan Greenspan addresses the US parliament “on the hill”. I have said, as clearly as possible, what we thought and what our own understanding of the situation was. We try to be as transparent and predictable as possible. We are not influenced – as stated in the Treaty, which is very clear in that respect – by any so-called “voices” or recommendations. We have a duty not to be influenced – in any respect. Not up or down. Because it was suggested we do this or that. Our colleagues, the Vice-President and myself, all members of the Governing Council know that we have a mandate – a very clear mandate – given by the Treaty. We know what the people of Europe are calling on us to do. We are responsible for price stability. 311 million people are expecting us to deliver price stability. And their message is very clear: they are asking us to live up to our mandate. That is the message of the 311 million people. And because we live up to our mandate, we can reinforce confidence in those 311 million people. And we also inspire confidence to investors and savers in Europe and the world in a way which allows us to deliver the lowest market rates that existed in the most credible part of Europe, from a monetary point of view, before the euro. Which is an incredible success. And let me mention, en passant, that the 2% rate that we have maintained for two and a half years while very solidly anchoring inflationary expectations was a level of interest rates lower than the lowest rate that the Bundesbank had ever set since its creation, since World War II. The Bundesbank itself had never set its discount rate at the level of 2%. We were lower than its lowest level. And not for 80 million Germans, but for 311 million people in Europe. And again, this level of market rates, this level of market interest rates over five years, ten years, thirty years and fifty years is duet to the confidence in our own Central Bank. Our own credibility. The credibility of the Governing Council of the ECB. Among those people who are looking at what we are doing and taking decisions on a day-by-day – even a minute-by-minute – basis, you have non-euro area residents holding approximately EUR 3.5 trillion in negotiable instruments and liquid deposits. Those people are making judgements on our credibility to deliver price stability over ten years, over thirty years and over fifty years. Because we are credible they give us low market interest rates favourable for growth and job creation. And that is the reason why we are faithful to our mandate. If I am not misled – but perhaps I was reading things too rapidly – they were divided: ten on one side and eight on the other side. So in this shadow group there are various views. Again, before the euro was set up nobody was predicting that we would be as credible as the most credible central banks. Every economist, every market participant, investors and savers were thinking that there would be a loss of credibility, which was after all understandable because we were going to merge highly credible currencies and currencies that were not at all as credible. So a kind of average of credibility and confidence was what the observers, economists, investors and savers were expecting. Because of our remarkable own credibility we could deliver this extraordinary low level of rates, which had been the privilege of only a part of Europe and not the privilege of 311 million people. Today we have judged unanimously that the increased level of risks to price stability embedded in the situation were such that today’s correction was necessary to fulfil our mandate and to maintain the full credibility that we have. I have to say that when you look at the figures extracted from the various bond markets – it’s not literature that we are discussing its fact, figures, numbers, arithmetic – when we said that we would moderately increase our rates, we gained in terms of credibility. We have gained in terms of forward break-even rates and we have proved that our own interaction with the European and global markets has led them to judge that we were right in doing what we have done. And in so doing, we will allow growth in Europe to be sustained and not short-lived. That is the conviction of the 18 members of the Governing Council. I said that we were unanimous. First on the Governing Council sentiment. You might remember that we had indicated that we were in a mode of strong vigilance in Athens and I remember that all of you noted that the sentiment of the Governing Council was different in Athens in comparison with what it had been a month before. We judged that the risks to price stability were increasing, were on the upside, and I made that very clear in responding to questions. We confirmed the view that risks were on the upside and had augmented at the press conference and in the introductory remarks a month ago, and that was again noted by everybody. It was so clearly noted that it triggered a great number of voices – that have already been mentioned – commenting on interest rates. We have various views inside the Governing Council, as it is necessary. Collegial wisdom implies that you exchange all possible information, arguments and analyses. The pertinent entity which is the Governing Council relies very much on a collegial, very confident and very comprehensive exchanges of views. And there emerges from that exchange of views a majority sentiment which can from time to time be a unanimous sentiment. We unanimously decided today to do what I have already announced, and of course we had various views, which were exchanged. Some perhaps could have imagined that we would have gone higher, and others perhaps would have thought before the discussion that we could wait a little longer. But after the discussion those who wanted to go higher considered the move that I am commenting today to be correct, and the others thought that it was appropriate to join in and to take the decision I announced, which again has been taken unanimously. You had a series of questions on vigilance. I will only say again what I have said very clearly. We are not, ex ante, engaging in a series of interest rate increases. We will monitor all developments closely, as I have said, with respect to risks to price stability. And we will continue to do exactly what is necessary to deliver price stability and to be credible. We will maintain the confidence of households in price stability, and maintain the confidence of investors and savers over time. We will solidly anchor inflation expectations and preserve a yield curve which is exceptionally favourable for growth and job creation in Europe. All this relies on our European and global credibility. I am not sure if I understand your question correctly. If I understand the question correctly, certainly not! But allow me to mention two things: First, the Federal Reserve is responsible for price stability, which is a necessary condition for growth and job creation, as you will find out in the speeches of my colleague, Alain Greenspan. We share exactly the same sentiment: price stability is a necessary condition for growth, sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. Not per se, unfortunately, a sufficient condition, but a necessary condition. The Federal Reserve does what it has to do and we do what we have to do. The judges are the observers, households, market participants, investors and savers and the facts and figures I was mentioning. I recommend that you look at the figures. This morning I looked at the markets to check the differential between the US ten-year rate, for instance, and the Euro ten-year rate. I am not sure that the large public perceives that this differential is in the magnitude of 1%, a full 100 basis points. Second, as regards the banking conference in Frankfurt which took place approximately a fortnight ago, I did not stand up, I was there at the banking conference, I had been invited, I was on the spot, and the Chairman of the panel, Mr Walter, asked me “could you tell us, Sir, what we need to know and to understand on interest rates and the monetary policy of the ECB”. It was a direct question, which I was asked when I was on the podium. I responded in what I trusted was necessary, namely to give those of you attending clarity and appropriate information and to give, through you, of course, market participants, observers, savers and public opinion the information that would be useful at that stage. We really trust that transparency is very important. At that time, there were so many voices speaking on interest rates, not inside the Governing Council but outside of it, that perhaps some of you might have had trouble understanding exactly what was happening, and I thought that it was appropriate to provide this information. I will respond immediately: I said that I conveyed the sentiment of the Governing Council. Two very different questions. As you know, we do not follow core inflation. We follow headline inflation. And we are very clear as regards our monetary policy concept. We also say that it is extremely important to look to the medium term. In accordance with our mandate, we have to deliver price stability in the medium term, which means that we must understand what is transitory and what is permanent in the inflationary phenomenon. In the introductory remark, we mentioned the fact that, from time to time, we hear voices mentioning that core inflation – that is, their definition of core inflation – is the best predictor of future inflation. When you look at research, facts and figures, it is clear that it is much more complex. There are cases where core inflation is a good predictor. However, there are a lot of cases where core inflation is not a good predictor. This is because, contrary to what some are arguing – that headline inflation will go down to join core inflation – it is, in fact, the opposite that holds, that core inflation is going up to join headline inflation. It is therefore very misleading to trust that core inflation (of which there are various definitions) is always a good predictor. In any case, as you know, we look at all the information at our disposal, separating what we trust is transitory from what we trust is permanent. An additional remark we made was that there is now little doubt that a large part of what we are observing in the oil prices and in the commodity prices is a demand-driven process, that is, coming largely, but not exclusively, from emerging Asia and is also producing a lot of consequences in the manufacturing sector. And so some prices are pushed up, while others are pushed down. If you eliminate all those prices that are pushed up and maintain in your understanding of inflation those which are pushed down, perhaps it is not fair; perhaps it is better for demand-driven change in relative prices to look at the full picture and not only at part of the picture. This of course calls for additional research – there is a lot of research on that. Probably, what I am telling you now is an emerging consensus amongst our own constituency of central banks. First of all, I feel the responsibility of being the President of a college that must deliver price stability: a college that is called by a Treaty, and by 311 million people, to deliver price stability; and a college that has so far succeeded in achieving the highest level of credibility vis-à-vis Europe and the rest of the world, as far as market participants, investors and savers are concerned. As regards my own feelings, they are feelings of responsibility and also that of a very strong team spirit. The 18 members of the Governing Council are a great team. And seen from the rest of the world and from Europe, that team is credible. And I can prove it. Who would have thought that I could stand here in front of you and tell you that over the past five years we have had the same level of medium and long-term market rates – not to speak of the short-term rates (we are lower as regards the short-term rates) – as the best and most credible currencies. The debate today was profound, deep and highly responsible. We discussed all possible arguments and exchanged views to be sure that we were taking the best decision. And that is our intimate conviction. First on the growth potential. We ourselves are not dictating what is the growth potential of Europe. All economists, all international institutions and national institutions are looking at it. And I will refer to what seems to me to be some kind of emerging consensus. When I take the analysis of the OECD, the IMF, the Commission, our own analysis, the private-sector analysis and so forth, I would say, as regards the medium and long-term growth potential, that the previous appreciation was that it was between 2% and 2.5%, and now there is probably a sentiment – again, I am cautious as you see – that we are closer to 2%: 2% plus something which is meagre, 2.1%, 2.2% perhaps; but closer to 2% than 2.5%. On a shorter-term basis, namely for next year for instance, there is also quite a large sentiment – but, again, I am very cautious – that perhaps we are just below 2%. 1.5% is not a figure which, to my knowledge, is applicable to the short term or medium term. It would apply rather to the much longer term – 20 or 25 years – taking into account very poor evolution of demography and perhaps also the very negative working assumption that structural reforms are not being done. I consider it not credible because it accumulates a number of negative factors that I trust will be corrected. On predictability, we were very proud to be one of the most predictable central banks of the world, perhaps I could say “ex aequo” with a great sister institution – perhaps the most predictable – and we will continue to be highly predictable. … no, I am not sure it is an increase in predictability It is an implementation of predictability. First of all, it is not a new decision. It is a decision that was implemented when the euro was first introduced. And the market people – the specialists observing what we were doing, looking at our website – could see that there was no change. It was what we had done since the very beginning; it was embedded in our policy. It has been made more visible, but there has been no change. We are bound to treat private paper and public paper in the same fashion. And the A-minus threshold that you mentioned, again, is something which has been state of the art since the very beginning. We were told very often by parts of the economists’ community and by a lot of good advisors that we were – and this was exactly the contrary observation – too benign, too positive vis-à-vis government paper, that we should practice a lot of haircuts and so forth, or practice haircuts combined with the Stability and Growth Pact implementation – or non-implementation. We thought that this was not appropriate. We said that it was not appropriate for us to invent a new sanction that would apply for non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact via this collateral mechanism. We felt that we should not do that. But we mentioned also very clearly to market people that we were taking the paper at its market value, so that if the markets would assess that the paper was less credible and the spreads would augment, then the value of the paper that we would take as collateral would diminish. And then we were sticking to this appreciation by the market itself. I thought I had been clear, but this is an occasion to be clear again. We have not taken any ex ante decision to embark on a series of interest rate increases. We will look at the facts and figures, make our judgement on the risks to price stability and take the decisions we will judge appropriate to deliver price stability. Papademos: We do not expect that a change in the monetary policy stance is going to have a significant effect on economic activity in the euro area as a whole. And then the extent to which there would be a specific impact in a given country depends on a variety of other factors that influence economic activity in that country as well. As Lucas said, we look at the 311 million people and we cannot do otherwise. It would be exactly as if you would ask our friends in the US whether they are taking into account the position of Texas, of California, and so on. You see, we have a single monetary area, a single euro, and we have to make an overall judgement. And I mentioned in the introductory remarks that Lucas and I and all our colleagues were pleased, I have to say, with some of the measures that have been taken on the structural side, Ex ante means “ex ante” in English and in Latin. In French, I would say “a priori” and not “ex ante”, but only in French. In English it would be – it seems to me – “ex ante”. 2% is not the lowest, it is lower than the lowest figure attained by the Bundesbank. It is perfectly possible that 2.25 has the same characteristics! No, I will not. But I will tell you – because you are offering me the possibility of making the point – that what we do is to cope with the risks we see. From time to time, I am told that these risks do not actually materialise. And then it is added that one should wait for the materialisation of these risks. But if a risk materialises, it is no longer a risk! It has become the figure you have in front of you, and that would be too late. So, here we are doing something that we consider to be exactly appropriate to cope with those risks and to avoid a materialisation of those risks. And this is the understanding of the global market. The global markets have understood this, if you look at the range of market information we are receiving, particularly from the bonds market, whether indexed or not. I will certainly not give you a neutral rate figure. It was not done on the other side of the Atlantic either. I do not myself refer to a neutral rate. I refer to the rate which is in line with what allows us to deliver price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability over time. As regards your first question, I will only mention that, at the level of the staff – and do not forget it is the staff of the Eurosystem who prepared the projections – we have taken all information into consideration, including the information that was available in Germany, of course, but not only that on Germany, all the information available in all of the 12 economies that make up the euro area. As regards monetary policy, Jean-Claude Juncker himself said it very clearly in front of the Parliament: It is our decision. It is the decision of this institution and there is no dispute on the fact that it is our decision. So, where monetary policy is at stake, there is absolutely no ambiguity. As regards the dialogue with Jean-Claude Juncker in preparation of the G7, we have never had any problem of that kind in the past, and I do not expect any such problem in the future. You know that we will be having discussions with our other friends, with members of the G7 on exchange rates. In that respect, we had in the last G7 meetings a very clear sentiment that I have signed up to myself and that was endorsed by all members, including Jean-Claude Juncker and his predecessor. And I expect that we will reach a consensus in exactly the same fashion, a consensus that will not only be a consensus amongst Europeans – because that would obviously not be very efficient – but a consensus with the United States, with Japan and with the other friends – the United Kingdom and Canada – and that we will together sign what we trust and judge to be appropriate. You will see what we will say in London, and I will of course not reveal in advance what we will say. It is absolutely clear that we have a purdah period and that if there has been such communication; it was not in line with our concept. I have no memory of anything in November, but then it was because one person did not realise that there were journalists in the room. But it is not the intention of any member of the Governing Council not to respect the purdah period, that is absolutely clear and it is important. It is a rule which is also state of the art in the constituency of central banks. As regards your first question, no members of the Governing Council were surprised by what I said because I expressed the sentiment of the Governing Council. "
2005-11-03,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our press conference. Let me report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, taking into account ongoing upward pressure on prices stemming mainly from energy price developments, we have concluded that the monetary policy stance still remains appropriate. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. At the same time, strong vigilance with regard to the upside risks to price stability is warranted. Strong vigilance is also called for in the light of ample liquidity and buoyant monetary and credit growth in the euro area. It is of the essence that the increase in current inflation rates does not translate into inflationary pressures over the medium term and to ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Across the maturity spectrum, interest rates in the euro area remain very low in both nominal and real terms, and the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Although economic growth has been dampened by the marked increase in oil prices over recent quarters, it appears that the euro area economy has shown considerable resilience to this shock, supported also by responsible wage-negotiating behaviour. Moreover, the latest indicators suggest that economic activity is currently strengthening. This would be in line with the September ECB staff projections, which indicate a gradual recovery from the second half of 2005 onwards. On the external side, it is projected that ongoing growth in global demand will support euro area exports, and on the domestic side, that investment will benefit from continued favourable financing conditions, as well as from the robust growth of corporate earnings. Consumption should gradually recover, broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income. At the same time, the outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks, relating mainly to oil prices, concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence. Turning to price developments, recent increases in mainly energy prices have pushed headline inflation rates to levels significantly in excess of 2%. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in October 2005, compared with 2.6% in September and 2.2% in the two preceding months. It is likely that HICP inflation will remain elevated in the short term. As we stressed in October, it is key in interpreting current inflation rates to make a clear distinction between temporary, short-term factors on the one hand, and those of a more lasting nature on the other. While some developments might prove to be transitory, markets expect oil prices to remain at high levels, driven mainly by buoyant global demand and, to some extent, by fragilities on the supply side. This suggests a more lasting impact of energy prices on overall price developments. This assumption underlies our forward-looking assessment of price developments. At the same time, wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, with labour markets weak, this should continue for the time being. Moreover, pressure from manufacturing prices remains low given strong global competition. All in all, while inflation rates are expected to stay above 2% over the shorter term, there continues to be no clear evidence yet of domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. We remain, however, concerned about the medium-term upside risks to this scenario. As we stressed a month ago, these relate to ongoing uncertainties surrounding oil market developments, to a potentially stronger pass-through than has so far been observed, on account of higher oil prices being passed on to consumers via the domestic production chain, and to potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour. In addition, possible further increases in administered prices and indirect taxes have to be taken into account. Hence, strong vigilance is required to ensure that medium and long-term inflation expectations for the euro area remain well-anchored. The monetary analysis also points to increased upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Liquidity in the euro area is very ample by all plausible measures. Moreover, the strengthening of monetary growth observed since mid-2004 has gained further momentum over the past few months. Growth in the monetary aggregate M3 has been driven by its most liquid components, confirming the increasingly dominant impact of the low level of interest rates. Furthermore, the growth of borrowing, especially mortgage loans, remains very robust. In this context, price dynamics in a number of housing markets need to be monitored closely. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that energy price increases, in particular, imply upward revisions to the outlook for short-term price developments. Some of the contributing factors can be expected to be temporary but others are likely to be more lasting. Domestic inflationary pressures over the medium term still remain contained in the euro area, but significant upside risks have to be taken into account. Moreover, the monetary analysis identifies increased risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Overall, cross-checking the information from the two pillars confirms that strong vigilance is warranted to keep inflation expectations in line with price stability. Only by keeping medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability can monetary policy make a significant ongoing contribution towards a recovery in economic growth. As regards fiscal policies, a number of countries have presented their 2006 budget plans. Despite some welcome progress with fiscal consolidation, the outlook for countries in excessive deficit is a matter of great concern, as there is a risk of consolidation not proceeding and commitments for this year and next not being met. Further delays in the correction of excessive deficits and a continued inclination to look for the most lenient way to implement the procedural steps of the revised Stability and Growth Pact risk undermining the Pact’s credibility. This must be avoided. All parties involved in the forthcoming decisions carry an important responsibility to ensure the proper functioning of the overall fiscal framework in the future. This would be the most effective way to enhance the growth prospects of the euro area and to build confidence in public finances ahead of the time when the challenges of population ageing set in. We therefore urge countries with fiscal imbalances to give priority to their timely correction and to implement the revised Pact rigorously. This will send the right signal to the public and support the credibility of the fiscal framework. As regards structural reforms, we stress again the urgent need to increase the flexibility of labour and product markets in order to achieve a more dynamic and competitive European economy and to help foster the adjustment processes within the euro area. The opportunities arising from globalisation and rapid technological change can best be captured by allowing and by speeding up structural change with a view to enhancing potential growth and employment creation. This would also help to facilitate the necessary adjustment to the higher level of oil prices by further increasing energy efficiency and energy savings, while avoiding distortionary measures that hamper the adjustment process. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  I already said several times that we were not promising anybody that we would not move. And that we stand ready to move at any time when it is required by our mandate and by the situation. Today, and as I said in Athens – and we referred explicitly to the Athens judgement and assessment - we think that present interest rates are still appropriate, that strong vigilance is of the essence in the present situation and that inflationary risks are on the upside. I will only mention that. We are very clear that we can move at any time. First we did not repeat again and again. In Athens we said “strong vigilance”, and I repeat “strong vigilance”. But before Athens we did not use this adjective. Second, we considered the pros and cons of increasing rates or leaving rates unchanged. And we concluded that the present level was still appropriate. Third, we are monitoring expectations very closely. And, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, the solid anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence not only to fulfil our primary mandate to which we are inflexibly faithful, because it is the Treaty requirement, but also to continue benefiting from favourable market interest rates, particularly medium, long-term and very long-term, which incorporate this solid anchoring of inflation expectations. From that standpoint we are looking at all possible information, particularly the break-even inflation. And we could observe during the last months a certain tendency to go up. We are looking at this element very carefully. On behalf of the Governing Council I will tell you where we stand. First, the Governing Council recalls the ECB’s Opinion of 6 October 2005 on a draft article concerning Banca d’Italia to be inserted in the draft law on the protection of savings. In particular in relation to paragraph 6 of this draft article, which requires the Governor to consult the Directorate on measures related to non-ESCB tasks falling within the Governor’s competence, the Governing Council is of the opinion that, in light of the widespread practice in the European Union for decision-making in supervisory matters, a modification of the current draft to allow for collegiality would be desirable. This is a reminder. Second, the Governing Council is fully committed to respecting the general principles of Community law, such as that of ensuring a level playing field among all market participants without any distinction based on nationality. In this context, it is recalled that Article 105 (1) of the Treaty and Article 2 of the Statute of the ESCB and the ECB require the ESCB to act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources. Third, in line with the Treaty provisions, according to which the ESCB is asked to contribute to the achievement of the Community objectives, the Governing Council is fully committed to the goal of promoting financial integration in the European Union. This is also clearly reflected in the Eurosystem’s mission statement, which was made public in January 2005. My fourth point is: against this background, as already mentioned on past occasions (here at these press conferences), the Governing Council initiated an informal dialogue with Banca d’Italia as regards some recent cross-border takeover bids concerning Italian banks. Fifth: In conducting its informal dialogue, the Governing Council did not intend to interfere with investigations conducted at the level of the European Commission. The Governing Council recalled in particular that the European Commission has sole jurisdiction to decide whether bank mergers are compatible with the Single Market Act. Sixth: Moreover, in conducting its informal dialogue, the Governing Council did not intend in any respect to interfere either with investigations conducted at the national level, or with the supervisory responsibilities of Banca d’Italia defined by national law. And my last point is the following: Without prejudice to the outcome of the current proceedings in Italy, as a result of its informal dialogue, the Governing Council has come to the conclusion that the procedures followed in the context of the recent cross-border takeover bids concerning Italian banks were based on a national legal framework that allows for a degree of discretion that could be used in a manner which is not necessarily in line with the above-mentioned principles and objectives of the Community. And that is the position of the Governing Council expressed by my voice. First question: Yes, we believe that the 2% level that has been maintained for a substantial period of time has been the right response by the ECB to the various situations in which we found ourselves. I would insist on one point which I consider very important. It’s perfectly clear today that we can move at any time and I warn the market very clearly in this respect. Even in the second semester of 2003 and during all of 2004, we never promised that we would not move. We were called on to say and to promise the market that we would not move for a “considerable period of time” – you might remember that – by a variety of economists, by a variety of good advisers. We said no. We said, as a central bank, we want to be able to react at any time without being tied by pre-commitments. We are responsible for price stability; we are responsible for delivering price stability. It’s as simple as that. The fact is that, during all this period, we have maintained a solid anchoring of inflation expectations even in very difficult circumstances, and even when – including in 2004 – we had tensions and shocks. To your first question, it’s absolutely clear that we believe that we handled these difficult circumstances very well. Your second point on forward-looking indicators: it’s clear that we have a concept of monetary policy which is designed for the medium-term and we absolutely need forward-looking indicators. It is also, from that standpoint, absolutely clear that we have to look permanently at the risks, and particularly the upside risks, of inflation. We will never – and I trust that no central bank would – wait for the materialisation of these risks to act. The problem, on the contrary, if you want to solidly anchor inflation expectations – particularly in the medium and long term – is that you have to be able to anticipate. That’s clear and that’s the way the Governing Council considers this issue. As regards wage behaviour, it is clear that, so far, we have not observed the kind of crystallisation of increase in wage and salary settlements, those second-round effects that are our main enemy. In a period where we have an oil shock it’s clear that we permanently call on social partners to be aware of the fact that it is extremely important to avoid such second-round effects and we will continue to monitor this particular point with extreme care. I respond first to your last question: I said the contrary : “We never promised that we will not move.” The advice we got was: “declare in advance that you will not move.” We refused to say that. The Council is not divided and has not been divided and all those who have spoken during the last month had no other message than the Athens message of the Governing Council. Of course, there are phenomena of communication and you all are experts on communication. One sentence is picked up, another one is picked up. It is probably unavoidable that some sentences have been tougher than others and so forth. But the fact is that we were all in agreement with the message of Athens and we are all in agreement with the present message, which is the very clear message of the Governing Council. As regards the position of the Governing Council on the Italian case, I am not speaking of the position of any particular Member of the Governing Council, including a few that might have expressed themselves. I expressed the position of the Governing Council and I can repeat it, if you wish, but I will stick to that. This is our sentiment after conducting this informal dialogue. There are a number of other proceedings and our conclusion after recalling what we had already said on the improvement of the legislation in Italy because we were asked by the Italian Government. This is the first paragraph of the position of the Governing Council. We mentioned the modification of the current draft to allow for collegiality, which would be desirable, and without prejudice to the outcome of the current proceedings in Italy, as a result of its informal dialogue the Governing Council has come to the conclusion that the procedures followed in the context of the recent cross-border take-over bids concerning Italian banks were based on a national legal framework that allows for a degree of discretion that could be used in a manner that is not necessarily in line with the above-mentioned principles and objectives of the Community to which the Governing Council is attached. I will stick to that. This is the end of our informal dialogue. This is our assessment. This is the end of this informal dialogue. Question (translation): May I put a question in French? I am from Canada. In the communiqué you said that you were looking at the situation and there’s a lot of uncertainty at the moment. In this case, I would like to know whether you are worried about the real estate bubble in the United States and whether you think that the situation could get even worse and if it were to get worse, would you change your position? Trichet (translation): On this precise point I would only say that I signed the last statement of the G7. We had a consensus, worldwide consensus, and this worldwide consensus states quite clearly that each continent and each major industrialised economy has its own homework to do. As far as Europe is concerned for us the homework is structural reforms. Structural reforms which we all think are absolutely essential. Looking at the United States, it is quite clear, that their main problem is the fact that savings in the American economy are far too low. There is an international consensus on that point as well and that has been signed by the main industrialised countries. So we agree as far as the diagnoses are concerned and we agree that these defects have to be corrected. We also agree that we have to correct them in the most resolute way possible. That is all what I would like to say on that point, but it is quite clear that there are defects that have to be rectified in all the major international economies. On the first point, which was whether or not I will repeat if I would pre-announce something, I say exactly what I said in Athens, which does not mean that we cannot move at any time. And I said that in Athens too. Second, we had a very nice discussion, again, weighing the pros and the cons which were associated with the two possibilities I already mentioned, and we came to a consensus. As regards the pre-emptive strike: it is clear, and as I said already, that the ECB, as well as all central banks deserving that name would not accept to wait for inflation to materialise before acting. We are always projecting ourselves into the future. You know that our present action, according to the mainstream academic research, would probably start having real influence over a period of perhaps 18 months, perhaps two years, and will continue to have influence over a longer period of time. Regarding Mr Fazio, I will stick to the statement of the Governing Council. It’s my turn not to understand your question. In Athens we changed our message. It is absolutely normal that the various market participants and the interest market as well as the futures markets will have reacted. So what I have observed is in line with what we had decided to say … No, the markets are not stupid at all. The markets are deciding on the basis of their own judgement and assessments. They are very much deciding after reading your excellent articles, because they depend very much on the information they have and the overall environment including, of course, your own communication. So, I have nothing to say on the market itself. The market is perfectly the master of all its judgements and assessments. As far as we are concerned, we have no particular judgement of what the markets think or don’t think. I only tell you the following: we are, after Athens, in a different mode of assessing the situation. We have changed our communication. It was very clear in all media after Athens. I read all papers that were produced after Athens. It was very clear that it was very different from what we had before. I can only confirm to you, again, rates are still appropriate. Strong vigilance is of the essence in our eyes and we clearly see increased risks to price stability. That is exactly what we are saying and observing. And I add to that that we can move at any time. So, if you need some other information perhaps you could communicate to me what your assessment is of what the market is doing. But as far as we are concerned, we are very clear on what we think. I think I was clear on that. We can move at any time. And I would say that we have had, since Athens, several confirmation of our appreciation a month ago. As regards the monetary aggregates; as regards the components of the monetary aggregates, including M1, which is very dynamic; as regards the counterparts of monetary aggregates, including loans to the private sector, which are very dynamic; as regards our working assumption of a second semester, which would demonstrate a certain pick-up in economic activity. I still remain cautious and prudent. Again, we look at hard figures and we look at facts. But all that we have seen since Athens confirms and reinforces our judgement. That is what we are telling you right now. A rate hike would be justified by the necessity to deliver price stability over time. Delivering price stability over time and being credible in this delivery permits our yield curve and particularly the medium and long-term market interest rates to continue to be very favourable to growth and job creation. So, in our own judgement there is no contradiction between being faithful to our mandate and supplying Europe what it might need in terms of growth and job creation. And it is very important that you understand this sentiment of the Governing Council. We will see what happens in Europe. It is clear that the working assumption I have mentioned, which is the working assumption of the staff of the ECB, is also the working assumption of all international institutions. A disappointing first semester and a second semester, which would be more in line with this assumption of a pick-up in economic activity. I have always told you that we were totally pragmatic. We will see exactly what happens. We have a number of indications that confirm this working assumption, including various surveys, industry PMI, service PMI. We might have some indications that were obviously less flattering on the consumption side. But so far there is nothing to contradict the working assumption. I said in advance that I will stick to the position of the Governing Council. We, the Governing Council, have a position: we say clearly that - as you mention yourself - under the national legal framework there is a degree of discretion that could be used in a manner that is not necessarily in line with the above-mentioned principles and objectives. This is the position of the Governing Council. It is not a matter for the Governing Council. Each institution has to be up to its responsibilities. There are a number of institutions – you have the Italian government, you have the Italian Parliament, you have a number of authorities in Italy, you have the Banca d’Italia, you have the advisory board of the Banca d’Italia, you have the European Commission, and ourselves. As far as we are concerned, this is what we think after this informal dialogue. And all the other authorities have their own duties according to their own charters, their own legislation, their own authority on the basis of law or rules and regulations in the democracies that make up Europe. I do not want to repeat for the fourth time what I already said. Again, as regards the national law in question, we consider that it allows for a degree of discretion that could be used in a manner which is not in line with the principles to which we are attached. That is the clear position of the Governing Council. Unfortunately, there are a large number of countries in excessive deficit, so I do not want to mention any particular country. If there were only one or two I could specify those two countries. .It is, of course, one of our main worries that we have a lot of countries and economies that are in this situation. I rely very much upon your own assessment and judgement. The Governing Council is very clear in its own assessment and it produces a judgement which you hear from me and which you have in written form. You should not over-interpret it. I am exactly in the “mood” of Athens with the additional message that everything we have observed since then has confirmed the working assumption we made in Athens, both in terms of risks that are increasing and in terms of a pick-up in activity. The Governing Council is totally pragmatic. Everything we have seen since Athens has confirmed the working assumption we made there. On vigilance I have already responded. We are in the “mood“ of Athens. Everything that we have seen since then has confirmed that our working assumption was well-founded. On the second question, I would repeat what we have already said on the banking surveillance exercise. We are very keen on having the closest possible harmonisation and cooperation between the various authorities concerned. But it is a complex situation where you have some authorities that are the central bank itself, other authorities that are close to the central bank but not the central bank, others that are totally outside the central bank, some that are specialised in banks, and others that have a responsibility in the banking sector and other sectors, including insurance or the markets in general. As regards M3, it is absolutely clear that we have two pillars. We consider the monetary pillar as being very important for us, particularly as we had to organise the transition to the euro in a fashion which was extraordinarily ambitious, because we had to ensure that the euro had the highest possible level of credibility. I am very proud to say now, in 2005, that we have maintained the euro as credible as the best and most credible currencies that existed in Europe before the euro, including the Deutsche Mark. And that is something that is very important. This credibility is measured not only on a short or medium-term basis but also on a long and even very long-term basis, including over 30 years and 50 years – and we can check the credibility over 30 years and 50 years because such long-term bonds are issued. It is clear that we are helped by our monetary pillar. In the long or very long term, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, and so we look at it very carefully. M3 dynamism is indeed very closely associated with loan dynamism as a counterpart and that is one of the main reasons why we consider the risks to price stability to be clearly on the upside. We, the Governing Council do not produce projections ourselves. We refer to the projections of our staff, to the projections of the private sector or of various institutions and we make a judgement on the basis of this set of projections. So, all I could say, is that at a global level there is very large consensus and we are part of this consensus which considers that the risks that are at stake are the oil price, which is a very important risk. We all have to be fully aware of that. And we have particular difficult - as you know - because the futures market for instance is not a good predictor. We all have this problem. Second, we have another element which also has to be taken into account, which are the global imbalances. I already said that we are in agreement on the diagnosis. We also are in agreement on the work to be done by the various major economies in the world. It is good that we have a consensus on the diagnosis. It is good that we know what we have to do. It would be even much better if you could do it in a very effective and active way. This has still to be demonstrated but we encourage of course all actors and responsible entities to do that. We have undoubtedly another risk which I have to mention which is protectionism. Because global prosperity depends very much on the absence of protectionism and the least that I can say is that we are looking here and there and we see some emergence of this risk, which is extremely unfortunate. There is a last element which I have to mention which has been mentioned by the financial stability forum as a major risk, which is the under-pricing of risks in the global economy at the present moment, at least till now where we see very low real interest rates. We see very low spreads, we see very low risk premia and this is of course an element which has to be looked at carefully because it is not necessarily sustainable over the long run. We have to be fully aware of that. Each central bank has its own responsibility. I never comment on the decisions which are taken by the Bank of Japan or the Federal Reserve or other fellow central bank governors. And I do not expect that they would comment on what we do ourselves I would not like to turn myself to Heine and “Ich weiß nicht, was soll es bedeuten...” I think that communication and transparency are very important. The dialogue that we have is very important. It is very complex because you journalists represent Europe and you represent the world. Through you we communicate with Europe and with the world through your own judgement. I have to say that, the next day with Lucas we look at the titles and the articles and there is a wide range of interpretation. So what counts is finding the mainstream, the bulk of the message, but we have to accept the complexity of European and global communication. We are very proud that since the very beginning we introduced an element of transparency that did not exist before. You remember in January 1999 a central bank would have decided on the rates and would have not given an explanation for five or six weeks, which was the rule of the game and the state of the art of central banking at this point in time! We, since day one, introduced major elements of transparency, such as the introductory remarks and the press conference. We changed the state of the art of central banking and today there is no central bank that can move rates or not move rates without explaining why. That is now state of the art, with shorter or longer explanations, but all are giving explanations. So I believe that we were instrumental in moving a bit the state of the art in this respect. We try to do as well as possible, thanks to you also, in terms of being transparent and communicating in a world which is complex. "
2005-10-06,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Athens. The Governing Council has, today, met for the 12th time outside Frankfurt, meaning that it has now met once in each of the euro area member countries. I would particularly like to thank Governor Garganas for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to the staff of the Bank of Greece for the perfect organisation. Let me now report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, despite renewed upward pressure on prices stemming mainly from oil market developments, we have concluded that the monetary policy stance still remains appropriate. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. At the same time, strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted. It is essential that the increase in the current inflation rate does not translate into higher underlying inflationary pressures in the euro area. Strong vigilance is also called for in the light of ample liquidity in the euro area. Across the maturity spectrum, interest rates in the euro area remain very low in both nominal and real terms, and thus lend ongoing support to economic activity. For this support to continue, it is of the essence that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP has been growing at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.4% and 0.3% over the first two quarters of 2005, dampened in particular by higher oil prices. In line with our staff projections, recent survey indicators, on balance, support the view that economic growth could gradually pick up from the second half of this year onwards. On the external side, ongoing growth in global demand should support euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should benefit both from continuously favourable financing conditions and from the robust growth of corporate earnings. Consumption should gradually recover, broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income. This outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks, relating mainly to oil prices, concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence. Temporarily, further uncertainty arose as to the economic effects of the recent hurricanes in the United States, which assessments, in the meantime, have generally suggested to be limited and short-term. Turning to price developments, recent increases mainly in oil prices have pushed headline inflation rates to levels significantly in excess of 2%. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in September, compared with 2.2% in the previous two months, and it is likely that HICP inflation will remain elevated in the short term. In interpreting this jump in the annual inflation rate, it is key to make a clear distinction between temporary, short-term factors on the one hand, and those of a more lasting nature on the other. While no detailed information on developments in the components of HICP in September is available as yet, it appears that oil price increases have again played an important role, this time exacerbated by a much stronger increase in petrol prices owing to exceptional capacity constraints at refineries following the two hurricanes in the United States. If a gradual normalisation in this market segment is confirmed, an unwinding of the sharp increases in spreads between oil prices and refined products could materialise. Hence, these increases may be only temporary. However, there is currently no indication that oil prices will moderate significantly in the foreseeable future. Rather, markets expect oil prices to remain at high levels, driven mainly by buoyant global demand and, to some extent, by fragilities on the supply side. Accordingly, this scenario underlies our forward-looking assessment of price developments. Crucially, what matters is how these developments affect the outlook for price stability over the medium term. For the time being, there continues to be no clear evidence of domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. In particular, wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, with labour markets weak, this should continue for the time being. Our main scenario, therefore, remains one of elevated inflation rates over the short term, with a gradual decline thereafter. Upside risks to this scenario have, however, increased. These relate to ongoing uncertainties surrounding oil market developments, to a potentially stronger pass-through than has so far been observed, on account of higher oil prices being passed on to consumers via the domestic production chain, and to potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour, all of which play an important role in our assessment for price stability over the medium term. In addition, possible further increases in administered prices and indirect taxes have to be taken into account. Accordingly, strong vigilance is required in order to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations for the euro area remain well-anchored. The monetary analysis provides further insight into inflation prospects over medium to longer horizons. Money and credit have continued to grow robustly in the euro area over the past few months, with the annual rate of M3 growth now exceeding 8%. The strength of monetary growth has been increasingly driven primarily by the prevailing low level of interest rates. In recent months, the short-term dynamics of M3 have gained further momentum and the growth of borrowing, in particular mortgage loans, remains very strong. In this context, price dynamics in a number of housing markets need to be monitored closely. Strong monetary and credit growth, in the context of an already ample liquidity situation in the euro area, points to risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that oil and petrol price increases, in particular, imply upward revisions to the outlook for short-term price developments. Some of these increases can be expected to be of a temporary nature, while others are likely to be more lasting. Domestic inflationary pressures over the medium term still remain contained in the euro area, but significant upside risks have to be taken into account. Moreover, the monetary analysis identifies upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Overall, cross-checking the information from the two pillars confirms the need for strong vigilance in order to maintain inflation expectations in line with price stability. By keeping medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, monetary policy is making a significant ongoing contribution towards a recovery in economic growth. As regards fiscal policies in the euro area, most recent information continues to provide a very mixed picture. Some countries report significant imbalances, while others continue to maintain sound fiscal positions. Preparations for 2006 budgets are in their final stages in most euro area countries. It is essential that forthcoming budgets reflect the need for fiscal consolidation that both progresses at the appropriate pace and is embedded in a well-designed and comprehensive reform strategy. This would help to support confidence within the euro area by strengthening expectations of sustainable and growth-friendly public finances and by enhancing the credibility of the reformed Stability and Growth Pact. As for the impact of high oil prices on public finances, consolidation of budgets must be continued. Let me also recall the latest G7 statement, which affirms that subsidies and artificial price caps that constrain the price of oil and oil products have an adverse effect on the global market and should be avoided. In the context of its regular discussions about structural reform issues, the Governing Council focused on unit labour cost (ULC) developments within the euro area, which play an important role in determining inflation and competitiveness patterns across the euro area countries. Since the inception of EMU, several euro area countries have experienced significantly larger cumulative increases in their ULCs than the euro area average. On the other hand, some countries have exhibited cumulative ULC developments significantly below the euro area average. It must be understood that some differences in ULC growth rates are a natural feature of a well-functioning monetary union, as these may reflect catching-up processes or necessary adjustments to past shocks. In this respect, the flexibility within the euro area may well have been underestimated in its early phase of existence. At the same time, there is no room for complacency. In some euro area countries, wage developments have substantially and persistently exceeded labour productivity growth, leading to relatively strong ULC developments over a prolonged period of time, higher inflationary pressures and losses in competitiveness. This may be, at least partially, due to wage rigidities, such as an explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices or high reservation wages determined by the level of unemployment benefits, and to a lack of competition in some sectors. In the context of external shocks, such as sharp increases in oil prices, there is an even greater need for speeding-up structural reforms. Together with the completion of the EU internal market, such reforms would support ULC developments that are conducive to price stability and would further smooth the functioning of adjustment mechanisms in the euro area, thereby strengthening the foundations for sustained growth in output and employment. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  First of all, as regards what I have said today on behalf of the Governing Council, I said “strong vigilance” and I said that the present level of interest rates was “still appropriate”. And this is a little bit different from the previous language, you might remember, in the previous Governing Council meeting. You have to take that into account. As regards the inflationary expectations, we have to remain very prudent and cautious, but until now the surveys have been confirming their correct anchoring. As regards the information which we can extract from indexed bonds, it is true that the break even rate has gone up a little bit even if it remains significantly lower than the highest level we have attained in the past, in particular the peak we observed in 2004. This observation is one of the reasons for the strong vigilance message that we are sending out. At this stage, I would say that I am not pre-announcing an interest rate increase. But, again, we consider that strong vigilance is appropriate because we are now clearly facing upward risks to price stability. This is something which is very clear. On the first question on strong vigilance, again I am very clear. We consider that the risks to price stability are on the upside. We consider that strong vigilance is the appropriate posture. And, as I have just mentioned, we consider that the present interest rates are still appropriate. As regards our future actions, I will make two comments. First, I am not pre-announcing an interest rate increase. I have already said that. Second, we are not unconditionally promising anything to the markets. And I have said that very often in such press conferences. If at any time there is a need to move – we will move. And the markets must know that. Everybody must know that. We will not permit second-round effects to materialise. Because, again, we believe that this is our mandate, and because this would then immediately disanchor inflationary expectations. And it would be something which would be damaging to the overall financial environment of the euro area. We would then have medium and long-term market interest rates going up, because they incorporate these inflationary expectations. And then we would have an environment which would be less favourable for growth and job creation. As regards the information we are extracting from indexed bonds, I have already mentioned that the level of 2.15% that we have in some observations is higher than the level that we had before. And it is certainly a cause for strong vigilance. I have noted also that it remains significantly below the levels that we have observed in the past. As regards Mr Fazio, I will only mention that we have taken a decision regarding the draft legislation and I could comment on that if I have a question on the draft legislation. As regards the rest, and the investigation taking place in Italy, I have absolutely no comment to make. I have never commented on such matters at any time in the past. First of all, you will remember that we were asked to give our advice on 13 September 2005, when we received a request from the Italian Minister of Finance, who sent us the article concerning the Statute of the Banca d’Italia. I have a number of comments on the position that was taken by the Governing Council today: First, the Governing Council welcomes the draft article, which provides that the Governor will have a fixed term of office of seven years, without the possibility of renewal. In our opinion this complies fully with the Treaty and is very much standard practice in the European Union. Second, it is the Governing Council’s opinion that a fixed term of office should also apply to the other members of the Banca d’Italia’s Directorate (the “Direttorio”), comprising the Director General and two Deputy Directors General, since they may be involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks. Third, once the draft article have been fully implemented the state will be the majority – and perhaps almost the sole – shareholder. In the light of the changes to the shareholders’ composition, the election procedure for the members of the Board of Directors (the “Consiglio Superiore”) should be clarified and possibly simplified. Fourth, the Governing Council welcomes the draft article’s intention to increase transparency in the exercise of the functions assigned to the Banca d’Italia. The Governing Council notes that paragraph 6 of the draft article requires the Governor to consult the Directorate on measures related to non-ESCB tasks falling within the Governor’s competence. However, the modification of the current draft to allow for collegiality rather than mere consultation would be desirable. Indeed, collegiality is the rule in all EU central banks for decision-making, especially in supervisory matters. Fifth, we consider that the change in the shareholders’ composition does not affect per se the central bank’s independence. Currently the Banca d’Italia’s financial independence is guaranteed by the provisions of the statutes on the independence of the members of the Board of Directors and on the limits on the distribution of profits to the shareholders. However, given that, according to Italian law, the state is also the residual claimant for non-distributed profits, the ECB’s Governing Council calls for the introduction of a safety clause requiring the maintenance of an amount of capital and reserves that is adequate to ensure that the Banca d’Italia can perform its statutory tasks, thus preventing any potential incentive for the future sole shareholder to increase the amount of non-distributed profits to be given to itself. I would say that these five points are the main points which are enshrined in our advice. You will have the text immediately after this press conference. On the question on whether or not we discussed it – we discussed clearly the situation and we envisaged advantages and inconveniences associated with the possible decisions we could take. And we concluded that the present rates were still appropriate, that upward risks to price stability were augmenting, and that we were in a posture of strong vigilance. Again, we can move rates at any time if it is necessary. I have already said that and I repeat it. If growth materialises, of course it will be an element that is part of our working assumption, but I remain cautious and prudent. I said that, taking all things into account, we had some signs that our own staff working assumption was materialising. You could have seen, as we have, some surveys that are encouraging, but we have to remain cautious. We will see exactly what happens. If it appears that these positive elements are materialising, then they will be part of our overall analysis and it is clear that it will be incorporated in the overall perspective for price stability in the time to come. So then we will draw all the appropriate consequences. What is for us absolutely crucial is to deliver price stability over the medium term. This is our mandate and this is also what is best for the yield curve of the euro area. As regards the Banca d’Italia, I said what I had to say regarding our opinion on the draft legislation. I have already told you that we are following the situation and that we have had a dialogue with the Banca d’Italia which is an ongoing dialogue. So I confirm the ongoing dialogue to follow and monitor the situation on this issue of the Banca d’Italia. On the first question: we reached a decision by consensus. On the second question: I have said that the follow-up is ongoing: we continue to monitor the situation, with questions and answers. And that continues. No, there were no questions asked formally by the Governing Council to Governor Fazio on this occasion. Again, this is an ongoing process. On this occasion we concentrated on the draft legislation on the Banca d’Italia. It is an ongoing process. Question (translation from French): Economists, such as Jean-Paul Fitoussi, consider that the euro could be used as a tool to promote economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, however, these economists criticise the ECB for the excessive importance it gives to price stability as opposed to growth. What would you say to these criticisms, which incidentally are often made in France? Trichet (translation from French): Well, my answer is as follows: the first thing is that price stability, credible price stability over the medium and long term, is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation. That is what Europeans think. And that is why they adopted the Maastricht Treaty. And that is why the ECB was entrusted with the primary mandate of ensuring price stability. Now, I must say that when the Members of the Federal Reserve Board, our sister institution, make public statements, they also say that price stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation. We live in a world where the type of logical relationship between price stability and growth is one of “necessary condition”. Over the past two weeks you may have seen that we have observed rates on ten-year government bonds in some countries of the euro area as low as 3%. This is clearly extremely favourable, from a financial point of view, for growth and job creation. When we thought about creating the euro, nobody could have imagined that 311 million people in the euro area would have had access to such low 10-year market rates. The reason we have such low rates is in particular because we are credible, as far as price stability is concerned, over the next ten years; and I could say also over the next 30 years, or even the next 50 years! Yes, certainly: the pros and cons of not moving; the pros and cons of raising interest rates. The pros and cons of a rate cut could have been envisaged by some, yes. But, as I said clearly, the risks for us are on the upside, and it is absolutely clear that we have reinforced the message of vigilance. It concentrates on what has been done as regards the position on banking surveillance and it concentrates on banking surveillance decisions. On the first question, I have already responded several times, so again: everybody knows that we could move rates at any time. We have not made any unconditional promises to anybody. Second, I am not pre-announcing an interest rate increase. You can draw the conclusion that you want to draw from that, but, again, we are not pre-announcing an interest rate increase. But we do consider that all the elements that we have are indicating that risks to price stability are on the upside. And that in any case it is our determination to move, if necessary and needed, at any time. Your second question was on unit labour costs. I would say we have two messages on unit labour costs. One is to recognise that the flexibility within the euro area in terms of cost competitiveness is perhaps superior to what some had envisaged before the euro area was set up, meaning that there can be some important moves up or down in the relative cost competitiveness of the various economies. One example is Germany, where you had unit labour costs moving more slowly than the euro area average, which of course corresponded to a catching-up process, because, as you know, Germany had lost, on the occasion of reunification, a good deal of competitiveness, and a catching-up exercise was then in operation. In such cases, it is certainly good to improve the relative cost of competitiveness of the economy. And I would say that in some cases yes, it could be good to have nominal wages and salaries moving more slowly than the labour productivity increases. It is not a common situation, but it can happen, and it can be justified, again, by the need to regain lost competitiveness. I said that we had two messages, and one is the message that the euro area is like any big continental economy where flexibility of the relative competitiveness is an important feature. There are 311 million inhabitants in the euro area, and we have observed the same phenomenon in the United States, for instance. On the other hand, we have also said that there is no room for complacency, because you cannot continue constantly, for instance, to have unit labour costs increasing by more than the average when you do not, in fact, have a good level of cost competitiveness to start with. So we have a positive economic message on flexibility and a message that there is no room for complacency. On the first question, we have the traditional dialectics between the immediate impact on headline inflation and the secondary effects. When I say “short-term”, I mean that we are seeing the immediate impact of headline inflation. I also mean that we are at a level which is significantly higher than our definition of price stability, at 2.5%. And it will, mechanistically, go higher if there is not a decrease in the price of oil, which can happen. I will not, because it depends on a number of parameters, give you any figures now, but it will go higher – that is absolutely clear – in the months to come. And it is something which has to be very clear. Of course, because of these levels – the nominal levels, as I have already said – we believe that there is an absolute need to be strongly vigilant as regards precisely these second-round effects, which can be much more lasting and are our worst enemies. As regards the Banca d’Italia, I will only mention what we have already said in previous opinions, for example that any transitional regime would need to be compatible with Article 14.2 of the Statute. This has already been said and that is all I can say. Every institution has to respect its own mandate and its own responsibility. So it is up to the European Commission to make an assessment and to the EU Council to decide whether or not Bulgaria is ready to enter the European Union, and I will not give any advice to the Council. When Bulgaria has entered the European Union, then the first question which will perhaps be asked of the ECB will be whether or not it is opportune to enter the exchange rate mechanism, and I cannot respond in advance, so I can only confirm what I said. It is too premature for me to comment on entry to ERM II and, of course, on entry to the euro area itself. Question (translation from Greek): In the last two years more and more countries in Europe, the euro zone, have been using securitisation in order to decrease their public deficit. What is the position of the ECB regarding this situation, which has been intensifying of late, and which also concerns Greece? Furthermore, now that the negotiations with Turkey have started, what does the ECB think are the major structural changes that will have to be implemented in the banking system? As a general rule, the ECB does not like one-off operations because we believe that then there is a problem: you have it good for one year and it’s not good for the following year. Second, there is an institution that is entitled to decide on such matters, and the relevant institution in this matter is Eurostat, which depends on the European Commission. So, on the question being asked in general here, I will respond that we have first to see what the position of the relevant institution is. As regards Turkey, I already responded on Bulgaria, so I will make exactly the same response for Turkey. It is premature at this stage for us. On the first question, I am not sure that the figure that you mention is the appropriate figure if it refers to growth this year. I have myself on behalf of the Governing Council displayed on a previous occasion our own staff estimates, as you know. And this is not the Governing Council’s estimate, it is the estimate of the staff of the ECB, and the last such estimate is of a range between 1% and 1.6%. You can draw the conclusions you want from that. On housing markets, as I said, we have to look very carefully at what happens in housing loans, they are really very dynamic. On the other hand, we have areas in the segment in the euro area, in the vast continental euro area economy, which are extraordinarily dynamic, and others – like the first economy of the euro area in terms of size – that are depressed. We look at the average for the whole of the euro area, so I would say that, as an average, and despite the fact that in Germany the figures are very depressed, we nevertheless have figures that are on the high side, and that is one of the reasons why we have to consider upside risks and have to be strongly vigilant. Question (translation from Greek): I would also like to ask my question in Greek: Is the ECB concerned by the fact that four to five countries are close to 3% as regards their deficit, or even higher, and do you think we will have the same picture next year? And I would like to ask Mr Garganas how satisfied the Bank of Greece is as regards the decision of the government to decrease this deficit with measures of a non-permanent nature? Garganas: I do not think that this question is very pertinent and it is not really the responsibility and the competence of the Bank of Greece to deal with questions relating to the Greek budget. It is the Ministry of Finance that is responsible for that. As regards the first question I would very clearly tell you that we had a very strong message on fiscal policies in this Governing Council. And I quote: “it is essential that forthcoming budgets reflect the need for fiscal consolidation” for those countries that are in the situation that you were mentioning “that both progresses at the appropriate pace and is embedded in a well-designed and comprehensive reform strategy”. It is clear that we consider that the reformed Stability and Growth Pact must be implemented rigorously, as we said. It has been approved unanimously by the executive branches, by the Council, by the Eurogroup as well as by ECOFIN, and it has to be implemented rigorously – it is a very clear position. First of all, we did not discuss that point today. Second, I said exactly what I had to say. We are, in principle, against one-off operations because we believe that they do not help at all. Second – again it is a question which has to be checked, examined in detail and decided upon by Eurostat, which depends on the Commission itself. As far as we are concerned – again, we maintain our position, which is rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. I mentioned 14.2. Any transitional regime would need to be conducted within Article 14.2 of the Statute. On the second point I will only say that our position is crystal clear: we really think that implementing structural reforms all over the euro area will make it possible to elevate the level of the growth potential of the euro area, and this elevation of the growth potential is necessary if we want to have, again, more growth and more job creation. So that is a clear position, and we ship that position to all partners – in particular to the public. Mainly to the public opinion, because it is the public opinion which has to be convinced. If the public opinion were convinced then everything would be much easier, in particular at the level of parliaments, at the level of governments, and at the level of social partners in general. Again, as regards the Banca d’Italia, we are examining the position which has been taken as regards a particular responsibility, which is banking surveillance. Banking surveillance, as you know, is an area where you have a decentralised system and national responsibilities that are taken by various national institutions – such as central banks, independent commissions, or any kind of national arrangement. I will not say anything, on top of what I have already said, except that we are monitoring the situation. I know that the European Commission, as you may know yourself, is also examining the situation. And I will not comment on whether or not we are satisfied. We are in an ongoing process. …I cannot tell you what we will do. Question (translation from French): How does the European Central Bank apply a common monetary policy on interest rates which reconciles the needs of very different economies, such as those of Germany and Greece? Trichet (translation from French): We are in a huge continental economy of 311 million people. In the Governing Council we consider all of these 311 million people, just as the Federal Reserve in the United States takes simultaneous account of Massachusetts, Florida, Alaska and California, all of which may have very different situations, as they historically have had. We did not discuss a rate cut today. "
2005-09-01,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our press conference. Let me start by saying that the Governing Council of the ECB again wishes to express its profound sadness at the loss of its first chairman and President of the ECB, Dr Willem F. Duisenberg, who passed away on 31 July. The Governing Council observed a moment of silence and, on behalf of all of the current and former members of the Governing Council, I paid tribute to the great qualities and achievements of my predecessor at the memorial service held in Amsterdam on 6 August. We owe it to his skilful leadership that the ECB and the Eurosystem successfully passed the stages of their establishment and initial challenges to become a central banking system that, through its actions, has gained the respect and trust of the people of the euro area and beyond. The Vice‑President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have concluded that the monetary policy stance remains appropriate, given the current outlook for inflation rates over the medium term. The prevailing exceptionally low level of both nominal and real interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum provides considerable support to economic activity in the euro area. At present our judgement is that, although upside risks to price stability exist, we continue to see no significant evidence of a build-up in underlying inflationary pressures in the euro area. However, not least in view of the risk of second-round effects from ongoing oil price increases, the Governing Council continues to monitor the development of inflation expectations very closely. At present, particular vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, turning first to the economic analysis. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, real GDP grew at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.3% in the second quarter of 2005, compared with 0.4% in the first quarter according to the latest data releaseEconomic activity thus continued to grow moderately in the euro area. The most recent survey indicators have, on balance, been supportive to the view that economic growth could improve in the second half of 2005, while higher oil prices continue to weigh on demand and confidence. On the external side, ongoing growth in global demand and improvements in euro area price competitiveness should support euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from very favourable financing conditions, the robust growth of corporate earnings and ongoing improvements in corporate efficiency. Consumption growth should gradually rise, broadly in line with expected developments in disposable income. This assessment is broadly consistent with the new ECB staff projections, which will be published today. Euro area real GDP is projected by staff to grow at rates of between 1.0% and 1.6% in 2005 and between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2006. Recent forecasts from international and private sector organisations give a similar picture. In comparison with the June Eurosystem staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 have been revised downwards slightly, reflecting both the downward revision of growth data for the first quarter of this year and the effects of higher oil prices. On balance, risks to the economic growth projections continue to lie on the downside, and relate to higher oil prices, low consumer confidence and concerns about global imbalances. Turning to price developments, annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in August according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 2.2% in July. Over the next few months, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to fluctuate around current levels, mainly due to recent developments in oil prices. Looking further ahead, ECB staff project average annual HICP inflation to lie between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2005 and between 1.4% and 2.4% in 2006. The latest projections constitute considerable upward revisions to the Eurosystem staff inflation projections published in June, reflecting the fact that oil prices have once again increased by more than was suggested earlier by forward rates. At the same time, wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters; the projections are based on the assumption that this trend will prevail for the time being given the current labour market situation. Overall, we continue to see no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Risks to this new baseline inflation scenario are on the upside and relate to potential further rises in oil prices, administered prices and indirect taxes. More fundamentally, the main risks to the inflation outlook stem from potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour triggered by ongoing oil price rises. In this respect, it is key that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Against this background, we will continue to monitor wage developments and inflation expectations very closely. Ongoing vigilance is required in order to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the strong monetary and credit growth which has been observed since mid-2004. The monetary dynamics are driven by the prevailing low level of interest rates, as reflected in the robust growth of the more liquid components of M3. Low interest rates are also fuelling credit expansion, with the strengthening of the demand for loans broadly based across the private sector. The growth of mortgage borrowing remains very strong. In this context, price dynamics in the housing markets need to be monitored closely. The liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample by all plausible measures, indicating risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons. To sum up: recent oil price developments have pushed up the inflation projections for the year ahead, while medium-term domestic inflationary pressures still remain contained in the euro area. However, the balance of risks to the baseline inflation scenario is tilted to the upside. Cross-checking the economic analysis with the monetary analysis confirms the need for particular vigilance in order to keep medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. By achieving this, monetary policy is making a significant contribution towards a recovery in economic growth. Fiscal policies will make their best contribution to stability, growth and confidence if prevailing imbalances are tackled as part of determined and well-designed reform programmes. A rigorous implementation of the revised Stability and Growth Pact would reinforce the credibility of reform plans and boost expectations of a sound fiscal and growth situation. Against this background, it is regrettable that the pace of fiscal consolidation remains too slow. In some countries, targets for correcting excessive deficits are at risk. Moreover, due to a very generous application of the new rules of the Pact, countries which have recently breached the 3% deficit limit are being granted relatively long periods to correct the situation. The Governing Council therefore urges Member States to step up consolidation efforts where needed and to implement the revised rules in a manner that supports these efforts and deters future slippages. As regards structural reforms, the European Commission has recently presented the “Community Lisbon Programme” and a list of measures at the EU level to relaunch the Lisbon strategy. The programme focuses on enhancing knowledge and innovation in order to strengthen growth, on making Europe a more attractive place to invest and work, and on creating more and better jobs. It includes, for example, measures to further open EU markets and to simplify the regulatory framework within which business operates. The Community Lisbon Programme will be complemented by the introduction of national action plans for growth and jobs, which the Member States will present this autumn. Progress at both the Community and the Member State level is crucial to addressing the economic challenges facing the EU. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  I would say the same. At this press conference I am not pre-announcing a rate increase and I am certainly not pre-announcing a rate cut. We were unanimous in considering that the present level of interest rates remains appropriate. And we were also unanimous in considering that particular vigilance is of the essence at the present juncture. Because, undoubtedly, the risks have been augmented, not only by the price of oil but also by the increase in the price of oil commodities. And we have to remain particularly vigilant as regards possible second-round effects. That is exactly the way we see things today. Again, I am not pre-announcing a rate increase. I am not pre-announcing a rate cut. The words that we have utilised are very clear. We consider the present level of interest rates appropriate and we are very vigilant. I have to make a point here: I have never, on behalf of the Governing Council, guaranteed anything to you or to the markets. I have never said “you can be sure that we will do this and that or that we won’t do this and that”. We are permanently vigilant. Everybody knows that we do not make promises. We are bound by our monetary policy, by our definition of price stability, by our two-pillar approach. And, again, we do whatever we judge appropriate to take account of the situation. We do not promise anything in advance. It is not the first time that we have observed an oil shock. We have experienced a series of such shocks. And you can see what we have done in the past. So, we are not reacting mechanistically, we are looking at the second-round effects. We are expressing vigilance and particular vigilance on this occasion. And we do whatever we judge to be right to maintain our medium-term orientation and to maintain inflation in line with our definition of price stability, with particular attention placed on inflationary expectations. This is the reason why, even in the present circumstances, with undoubtedly a big difference between the previous projections and the present projections, and taking into account all the risks that I have mentioned, it is nevertheless our opinion that there is today no case for increasing rates. But, again, we remain vigilant. We do not promise anything in advance. And everything depends very much on what we call the second-round effects. On the first point, every institution, every central bank and, in some respects, every economic agent has to take account of the impact of an oil shock or commodity shock or other such kind of shock. It has the effect of depressing real growth and pushing up inflation. It is not the first time that we have had such a shock since the creation of the ECB and of the euro. You know pretty well how we reason, and here you have a real case – we have this shock, we have the impact on expectations and projections. And you can see clearly that the staff of the ECB, have revised our growth projections slightly down for this year and down also for next year. We have also revised upwards our inflation projections. And taking everything into account we have concluded that there is no case for changing rates today and that we have to demonstrate particular vigilance. We do not promise anything in advance. You and the market knows that. In our opinion, and because you all know that and the market knows that, the market believes we are credible and capable of delivering price stability. That is why we have a solid anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium and long run On asset price inflation I would say that the Governing Council is monitoring closely what happens. The real estate segment of the asset market is complex. We have a number of economies in the European Union and in the euro area where real estate is extraordinarily dynamic, while in some others the market is flat or going in the other direction. We know that we have to look at this very closely. We also trust that our monetary policy concept is such, with its two pillars, that we are more able to take account of this aspect of the situation. Again, you know our today’s conclusion. First, we have received the report which was submitted by the Banca d’Italia to an inter-ministerial committee in Italy and we will reflect on that. The Governor of the Banca d’Italia has expressed his readiness to supply more information if necessary. Second, on the question of the banking sector and on the implementation of the Single Market, the position of the Governing Council is crystal clear. We are fully committed to the principle of the integration of the financial markets in the European Union and in the euro area. We are committed to it because it is required by European law and also because, in our opinion, it is good for the economy of the euro area, for the European Union and for the best possible functioning of the level playing field in this sector. And this applies not only to the banking sector, but to the financial services sector as a whole. The Governing Council is totally committed to the equal treatment of banks, whatever their nationality, in Europe, in the euro area and in the European Union. That is my second point. My third point is that the Governing Council is also of the opinion that it is necessary to actively reinforce cooperation and coordination between banking supervisors. Banking supervisors in Europe are different in nature. In some countries the banking supervisors are the central banks themselves. Others are connected to the central bank, while still others are independent of Government and the central bank. From that standpoint the system is decentralised. That being said, whatever the national arrangement, we are strongly in favour of the closest possible cooperation and coordination between banking supervisors. And my last point is that we will continue to monitor this situation closely, taking into account the fact that the Banca d’Italia has its responsibility according to European and Italian law, that there are other institutions that have responsibilities and are implementing their responsibilities in Italy, and also that there are responsibilities on the part of the European Commission as regards the implementation of European law. We will follow all of this carefully. I will take your second question first. I really have already responded. I am not pre-announcing anything. And you know that we can move whenever we judge that it is appropriate. It is as simple as that: no insurance policy given by us on any unconditional orientation. You know what the facts and the figures are. You know what our policy is. You know what our monetary policy concept is. You deduce yourself what we will or could do. Again, it is very important to understand that we are confident that our vigilance permits us to anchor medium and long-term inflationary expectations in an efficient fashion. On the first point, I mentioned that we were following up this dossier very carefully and that, as I said, the Banca d’Italia and its Governor had expressed its readiness to better inform the Governing Council, if necessary. I already responded to a question which was similar. Again, the Code of Conduct is a voluntary code which has been signed by each member of the Governing Council. It is not a law. It is not a European or national regulation. It is a voluntary adherence to that particular set of principles. It has been signed by all the members of the Governing Council. And I have said that we will continue to see the evolution of this dossier, which is also being followed by a great number of institutions that have their own direct authority. I cannot say anything else than that. For a long period of time, namely a year and a half, I have myself signed communiqués on various occasions, particularly communiqués of the G7, where we clearly signalled that the international community thought that it would be appropriate and advisable for a number of currencies belonging to the “emerging world”, and in particular “emerging Asia” – and I do not want to mention only one currency, because it was a message which related to a number of currencies – to move up and progressively take better account of the overall economic and monetary situation. I have always been discreet myself, because I consider that such matters are matters that you have to treat with some discretion – like all exchange rate matters. We have seen that there have been changes in the case of that particular country, namely China. I said publicly that this change was going in the right direction. And I would underline that it is the responsibility of China, it is the responsibility of the Central Bank of China, it is the responsibility of the Chinese authorities to take decisions in this respect, and that, in any case, seen from an objective standpoint it seems to me that the facts, the figures, the overall international and Chinese environments, as well as those of other countries, suggest that it would be in the interests of all to continue the move in the same direction. But, again, it is the responsibility of the Chinese authorities and the responsibility of the other national authorities concerned. I have already responded to such questions. And we certainly have, at this stage, no such assessment by the Governing Council. First point. We are, in the Governing Council, saddened by the terrible events in the United States and that are proving again that risks can materialise in all domains in a terrible fashion. So I would like to express our profound sympathy, sadness and solidarity. Second, we will see what the economic consequences are; it is much, much too early to draw any conclusions at this stage. On the question of the banking sector in Italy and in the rest of Europe, I restate that our principle is crystal clear: fair treatment, full and resolute implementation of the Single Market in financial services in general and in the banking sector in particular, for all legal and economic reasons. That is the position of the Governing Council. We have not opened any procedure at this stage. We asked whether more information was available, and we will monitor this situation. Again, the Governing Council has its own responsibility, which is important as you know, and there are a number of institutions which are involved in this particular case in Italy and in Europe – I mentioned the Commission, which has its own responsibility Well, this is premature, obviously, because we have not yet received the draft legislation. I have heard that the decision has been taken to change the law as regards the Banca d’Italia. So we are waiting for this draft legislation to be written. As you know, the procedure, as far as we are concerned, would be that the draft law would be given to the Governing Council of the ECB, and we would have to make an assessment of whether or not it is in line with the Treaty. We have done this before – you mentioned that in the case of a previous draft law that we received. And so at the appropriate moment I will tell you the position of the Governing Council on the draft law – which we do not yet have. No, not at all. Not divided at all. It is far too premature to embark on such an assessment. I would not even embark on such an assessment for those who are presently members of the European Union, or even for those who are not only members of the European Union but also members of the exchange rate mechanism II. So all I can say is that, as you know, we already consider Bulgaria and Romania as friends, as observers in our committees and meetings, including those of the General Council, so as to prepare in the best fashion possible for their belonging to the European Union, and tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow perhaps, if criteria are met and if everything is in good order, to the euro area. But it is far too premature and we will see when the time comes. I will not comment on the first question because it was discussed already. The mechanistic impact is going in the reverse direction. You know exactly what our present projections are, and you also know what the difference is with the previous projections. So all this is clear, at least in the arithmetic of our staff projections, and I said already what our conclusions were. On the other question, I already said what our present judgement is. The downward revision of growth for this year mainly comes from the downward revision of what was observed in the first quarter. The profile that we see is still one in which we should – in our present judgement, on the basis of all the information we have – see a certain pick-up materialise in the second semester. But there are risks, and of course the oil price increases are one of the obvious risks to growth. So we will see, we remain very, very pragmatic. We will see exactly what happens. Our judgement is that the profile is such that we should have, in the second half of the year, in the third and fourth quarters, an element of picking-up. We have exactly the same judgement as we had before, but since then, downward risks to growth have appeared, and these are undoubtedly associated with oil prices in particular, but not only oil prices, as I just said, also commodity prices in general. So again, we will see. I have said very often that we are not optimistic or pessimistic, that we are realistic, taking into account facts and figures on a permanent basis. When the Chinese authorities decide to make public anything, they will do so, and you will have the information and everybody will have the information. On the first point, I have to tell you that the Governing Council of the ECB is pursuing its own responsibility as clearly as possible. I made our principle clear again, and for the rest of it, it is certainly not appropriate for me to make a judgement on anybody. As I said, we are monitoring the situation closely and we will continue to be informed on a permanent basis. I have never heard anybody say that, but I would certainly say that Mr Fazio is one of us. First, “appropriate” is not a new word. We have used it before. Second, I am not pre-announcing anything, and since the ECB was set up, we have never promised anything or an unconditional bias. So I can certainly confirm that we can move if it is judged necessary. Nobody knows what might happen in the near future. Some of you have mentioned events that were totally unforeseeable. So I can only tell you that we will do whatever is needed. In our view, it is necessary to protect our definition of price stability and to be credible as regards our definition of price stability. As you know, being credible depends on our own action to preserve inflation in line with our definition of price stability. In doing so we are consolidating the anchoring of inflationary expectations and therefore helping delivering on growth and job creation in Europe in the present circumstances, and the present circumstances are not at all easy from that standpoint. It is clear enough. But we have the best nominal yield curve ever observed in Europe in the last 100 years. We I do not hear it very often, but check – it is reality. When we are asked to be forthcoming as regards growth and job creation, we know we do this by being faithful to our mandate and by being credible, which is the case. We are delivering the best yield curve ever available in any country in Europe over the last 100 years. So that is something, and one has to take it into account. Thank you very much. "
2005-07-07,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our press conference. The Governing Council of the ECB expresses its deep sympathy and its total solidarity with the British people and the Bank of England in these dreadful circumstances. We have observed a minute of silence in memory of the victims of these terrorist attacks and we convey our sincere condolences to the British people and the Bank of England. The Vice‑President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have concluded that the monetary policy stance is appropriate, given the current outlook for price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Across the maturity spectrum, interest rates in the euro area are low by historical standards, in both nominal and real terms, and thus lend ongoing support to economic activity. The Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors that might affect this assessment and remains vigilant with respect to the emergence of risks to price stability over the medium term. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail. In the context of our economic analysis, recent indicators of economic activity in the euro area have, on balance, confirmed that growth has remained subdued. High and rising oil prices in particular appear to have weighed on demand and confidence. On the basis of current information, the growth rate in the second quarter of this year is expected to be lower than the first quarter growth rate of 0.5%, quarter on quarter. Available data are still mixed, with some of the most recent indicators showing a slight improvement, but there are no signs as yet that a more sustained recovery in economic activity has already started. At the same time, looking beyond the short term, there continues to be reason to expect a gradual improvement in economic activity in the euro area. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the very favourable financing conditions, the robust growth of corporate earnings currently observed and ongoing improvements in corporate efficiency. Consumption growth should evolve broadly in line with expected developments in disposable income. On the external side, ongoing growth in global demand and improvements in euro area price competitiveness should support euro area exports. This assessment is in line with available forecasts and projections. This baseline scenario for growth continues to be surrounded by a good deal of uncertainty. On balance, risks to economic growth lie on the downside and are notably related to the persistence of high oil prices, the low level of confidence prevailing in the euro area and global imbalances. Turning to price developments, annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in June, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, compared with 1.9% in May. Over the next few months annual HICP inflation rates are expected to fluctuate around current levels and may not fall below 2% for the remainder of 2005. This outlook mainly reflects recent developments in oil prices, which were seen as an upside risk in the context of the June 2005 Eurosystem staff inflation projections. However, wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of moderate economic growth and weak labour markets, this trend should continue for the time being. Overall, we continue to see no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. At the same time, upside risks to this scenario for inflation warrant close monitoring. These risks relate mainly to oil price developments and their potential to lead to second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting behaviour. It is important that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Moreover, uncertainties about future developments in administrative prices and indirect taxes need to be taken into account when assessing currently available inflation projections. Looking at inflation prospects over medium to longer horizons, our assessment is also based on the results of our monetary analysis. In line with developments since mid-2004, monetary and credit growth in the euro area remain strong. The stimulating impact of the low level of interest rates has remained the dominant factor driving monetary developments, as reflected in the strength of M1 growth and the dynamism of loans to the private sector. Liquidity remains ample by all plausible measures. Overall, monetary developments support the case for vigilance with regard to upward risks to price stability over medium to long-term horizons. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms that domestic inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained in the euro area, while oil price developments in particular imply some upward revisions to the main scenario for price developments. The monetary analysis identifies risks to price stability over the longer term. Overall, cross-checking the information from the two pillars suggests a need for ongoing vigilance in order to maintain inflation expectations in line with price stability. In fact, by keeping medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, monetary policy is making a significant contribution towards a recovery in economic growth. Prudent fiscal policies could provide considerable support for confidence in the euro area. The discussions on revising the Stability and Growth Pact regulations have been concluded and rigorous implementation is now key to ensuring an effective framework for fiscal policy coordination and discipline. This is all the more true as current and projected fiscal deficits in several euro area countries still need to be addressed with rigour. In a number of cases these deficits not only imply a rising debt ratio, but also leave no safety margin for short-term budgetary relief in the event of adverse developments. In this context, as significant revisions of past deficit and debt figures have been reported for a few countries, let me also reiterate previous calls by the Governing Council for the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics. Finally, let me conclude with a few words on structural reform. As we have stressed repeatedly, a decisive and comprehensive set of measures aimed at achieving a more dynamic and competitive European economy with flexible labour and product markets is urgently needed. The primary objective of such measures is to deal with the ongoing challenges from globalisation, rapid technological change and ageing populations and, overall, to ensure greater resilience to shocks. These challenges are not specific to the euro area. Successful structural reforms would, however, also contribute to fostering the adjustment processes within the euro area. In particular, they would allow those member countries with a weaker record in terms of economic growth and employment creation to perform better in the future. As regards existing growth and inflation differentials within the euro area, there is clear evidence that the dispersion of inflation and real GDP growth rates in the euro area is not materially different from that of the United States and it does not show any signs of having increased since 1999. However, in cases where differences are not due to catching-up processes or temporary factors, structural reforms are even more necessary to enhance economic performance and flexibility in the adjustment process. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * On the first question, I have been in touch with Mervyn King on the functioning of the markets. Our joint observation was that markets were functioning on both sides of the Channel. Of course, both the stock market and the interest rate market had taken into account the events, but infrastructure and systems were functioning, payment systems were functioning. And so, we are alert, we are vigilant, we are monitoring all developments, we are keeping in touch and, at this stage, we have no particular information that would call for action. If this were the case, you can be sure that we would act immediately. Again, we are in permanent contact. On this occasion, I expressed our very deep sympathy to Mervyn. I expressed the emotion of the Governing Council. As I said, we had a moment of silence to express condolences to the British people and the families concerned and I asked Mervyn to convey this emotion and these condolences to the British people and to the authorities. I have been in touch also with Alan on the other side of the Atlantic and we made the same observation. The markets are taking events into account, are assessing the situation and all systems and infrastructure are functioning correctly. Again, we keep in touch. You very rightly recall that in the case of 9/11 we judged that it was appropriate to take decisions in real time and pour in liquidity on both sides of the Atlantic in the most expeditious and efficient way. And, as I said, we are in touch in real time, as demanded by our responsibilities. On the third point, we are looking at the situation with extreme care. We considered all possible factors that are guiding our own judgement on the monetary policy stance. We concluded that the interest rates were appropriate and that we were exactly in the same state of mind as last time. I am not pre-announcing a rate cut to you. I am not pre-announcing an increase of our rates. We think that they are appropriate: this is our present judgement. Again, we are taking everything into account, all the information that is available at the moment I speak. We have a wait-and-see attitude. But, again, I am not pre-announcing a rate cut. I am not pre-announcing a rate increase. Reflecting not on a short-term basis but on a slightly longer-term basis, we believe that growth will be more dynamic. That is also the judgement being made by all European and international, public and private observers; so we are not original in that respect. But we see good reasons why that should be the case and why it is not only our conclusion, but also that of global observers. That being said, we also say – and I have said this before – that we have real downside risks for the three reasons I have been mentioning: oil price increases, which are of course something that is certainly important, global imbalances, and the level of confidence. You know to what extent we are committed, being faithful to our mandate, to doing everything we can to consolidate, preserve and enhance confidence in all “constituencies” of the euro area; not only the abstract “economic agents”, but households and entrepreneurs. We trust that we have a responsibility in this respect. You are used to hearing from me why we trust that what we do is what we should do; and that what we do is the best we can do for growth and job creation in Europe. I do not want to identify any newspaper or media. In various media I have read various pieces of good advice, some going in totally the other direction. And from time to time advice going in both directions in the same media, as is perhaps normal in the very vivid opinion-based democracies of Europe and the world. So, we have a lot of good advice: to increase rates, to decrease rates, or to stick to the present level. But, again, my reasoning is the following: our mandate under the Treaty is to deliver price stability. There is no doubt anywhere that we are and will remain faithful to our mandate. We owe that to the people of Europe who consider price stability to be something which is extremely important. In a number of economies and countries the sentiment of the people is even that there are more price increases than we believe, more than is calculated at the national or European levels. This sentiment has to be taken into account. We are credible in delivering price stability according to our definition. That is the reason why the inflationary expectations are well anchored in line with our definition of price stability. In our surveys, we are at the level of 1.9%. When your definition is less than but close to 2%, it is difficult to do better than 1.9%. And the break-even inflation that we are extracting from index-linked bonds, by all means, is also in line with the fact that financial markets inflationary expectations are also fully in line with our definition of price stability. The fact that our financial environment incorporates inflation expectations in line with our definition is one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why we are currently observing the lowest level of the ten-year rate that has been observed in Europe for a 100 years. If we were less credible, we would have higher inflationary expectations. And then, all other things being equal, market interest rates would be higher. So that is why we think that, by being faithful to our mandate, we are delivering what is necessary for growth and job creation. I say that with the information that we have today, with the anchoring of inflationary expectations that we have today and with all the information that is available to you and to us. Things could be different tomorrow. We are pragmatic people. But today, clearly, this is our conclusion. And we can prove it. First of all we are guarding the currency, the currency of Europe, for 307 million people. We are multi-partisan – in other countries or economies or even continents we would say that we are bi-partisan – I would say we are multi-partisan; we have only one mandate, which is to guard the currency, preserve price stability, issue a credible currency. This has been a promise which has been made to all sensitivities in Europe and we are extraordinarily attached to this multi-partisan nature of our institution. Second the European Parliament has rejected twice amendments which were calling on us to decrease rates. I say that loud and clear because I am not sure that all of you are aware of that, on the basis of what I read in some papers: twice the European Parliament rejected amendments calling on us to decrease rates. That is the truth. And I would like you to take note of that. Third, as you said, the resolution, which was presented by the rapporteur and which had been prepared for the plenary in accordance with the appropriate procedures in the Parliament, found no majority, so there is no resolution. But again, if this is interpreted as a call on us to decrease rates, I can prove that it is a totally wrong interpretation. Now, let me say the following: any kind of comments from my side about a possible change of our own mandate is totally out of the question. We have a Treaty, we have a mandate – in the eyes of the European democracies, that mandate made price stability our primary goal whilst it is also a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation. And again, it seems to me that we are doing all we can by preserving price stability, to deliver a financial environment which is good for growth and job creation. And again we are speaking of figures and facts: when I say that we have historically low rates, it can be substantiated by all of you. No, the interest of the press conference is precisely to clarify such things. No, there is no difference. Vigilance is, for us, of the essence. And again, if we were deemed not to be vigilant, inflationary expectations would go up and we would be in an environment that would not be as favourable to growth as I have said previously. No, it is the same message, the same posture. Of course, some elements have changed and we have to take that into account. We were not in exactly the same environment in terms of oil prices, with all the effects that oil prices have on both growth and possible future inflation. Yes, I said that. There is no doubt. On the first point I would say that we do not think at this stage that these events could have any significant impact. We have had the experience of the abominable terrorist attack in Madrid, for instance, and the very same questions were posed at that time. And we had the sentiment that it was not the case. I would say that that is also our sentiment now. In any case, in these exceptional circumstances, the duty of an institution like ours is to be faithful to its mandate, to continue to be the anchor of confidence – more than ever – and to be alert. Monitor all developments and keep calm. On monetary policy, things are very clear. We consider that we have the appropriate level of interest rates. We judge the pros and cons of all possible action. And we judged, all of us, that the present rates were appropriate. And, again, I am not pre-announcing a rate cut. I am not pre-announcing an increase in our rates. This is exactly where we stand at the moment I am speaking. Wait and see. When we look at the situation through our economic analysis we look at all factors that are influencing our own situation in the euro area whether it is the global situation, the oil price, or anything that comes from outside. So, the situation of the economies that are in the centre and in the east of Europe is, of course, taken into account as part of the overall environment of the euro area. As regards the first question, when I mentioned “alert” and “vigilant” I meant alert and vigilant in all the domains where we have a direct responsibility, namely the appropriate and smooth functioning of the payment system, the appropriate and smooth functioning of the money market, all the infrastructure, and, of course, all segments of the financial markets. In the case of 9/11 it appeared that, because of the difficulty with some counterparties on one side of the Atlantic, we had to be – in the United States as well as here – very attentive to the necessary pouring of liquidity. This is, as I said, not the case so far in the present circumstances. But we will do all that we judge necessary. At this stage, we are observing that payment systems are functioning correctly, markets are functioning correctly. And I have nothing else to say after having checked with our own people here and being in touch with our friends – my close friends Mervyn in Europe and also Alan on the other side of the Atlantic. As regards inflation, it is absolutely clear that we have to take into account the administered prices and administrative decisions that could influence the inflation risk on the upside. I will not comment on the exchange rate. We take into account absolutely everything when we analyse our own situation including exchange markets. But I will certainly not comment on a particular level. It is not as you know the way I use to deal with that question. It is on both, by definition. The influence of an increase of oil prices goes in the two directions you have suggested. Let me say two things. First, we are totally pragmatic. We have to take into account all facts and figures, and the reality as it is. But, simultaneously, I would call on all partners to be as responsible as possible, for the producers to be as responsible as possible, as well as the consumers. We are not in a normal situation in this respect and, as you know, the international community – and the ECB as member of the international community – believes that progress can be made and must be made in the functioning of the market, particularly as regards higher levels of transparency of that market, so I would take advantage of your question to call again for as much transparency and responsibility as possible by all partners. As regards our present stance in comparison with the previous meeting, I repeat that we have the same attitude and I think I was eloquent enough in qualifying the monetary policy stance not to repeat what I have already said. But again an increase in the price of oil has exactly the two consequences you said, it is exerting downward pressure on the growth side and it is adding to upside risks on the inflation side. That is clear enough. On the first question: as you know, in our monetary policy concept we are reasoning medium term. Medium term, that is what is important. It is the reason why we are credible, fully credible – and I can prove it – as regards inflation expectations and price stability being delivered by us in the medium and long term, when everybody knows that we have had to face a number of shocks, including the present oil shocks, since the setting-up of the euro. So observers, market participants and economists could see that because of these successive shocks, we could have inflation over and above 2%, but nevertheless they had and they have full confidence in our capacity to deliver, in the medium run, price stability. The fact that we had a succession of shocks is well understood, I have to say, by observers, market participants, investors and savers. As regards your question on the political integration of Europe, we all have our sentiments as European citizens, in the Governing Council and in this room. As an institution, we do our job. Our job is to deliver price stability, to deliver a currency which is credible and inspires confidence to 307 million people. We had to care for that currency having the highest level of confidence that existed before the setting-up of the euro. That currency is called upon to be the currency of much more than 307 million people and 12 countries. Because, you know, that in the 25 present members of the European Union, 23 have no opting-out clause. So that is our responsibility. We will exert it as well as possible. As regards the organisation of the executive branches, I see very favourably the best possible organisation of the Eurogroup. I welcome the fact that the Eurogroup has a President for two years. We are totally independent, our credibility relies totally on our own independence, which everybody knows is not only conferred by the Treaty but is a visible reality. If the Eurogroup has anything to tell us, they can do so. Every fortnight I invite the President of the Eurogroup to our discussion in the Governing Council. I have the honour of being invited every month, together with the Vice-President, to the meeting of the Eurogroup, so this makes three times a month that we have the possibility of a physical encounter. I think that is a world record! I am not sure that you will find any other place in the world where such possibilities are offered! They are offered by the Treaty, which calls upon me to invite the President of the Eurogroup. My comment is very simple: it is not a question of growth, it is a question of convergence. To enter into the euro area, one has to meet the Maastricht criteria and to do so not only for a moment, but in a sustainable fashion. This is in the Treaty. Some economists would say that it has to be a nominal and a real convergence, namely a sustainable convergence. So that is the rule according to the Treaty. We will respect the Treaty. I will only add that it is of course in the interest of all partners that this convergence is substantiated. It is certainly in the interest of the euro area itself and it is also, of course, in the interest of a country which is joining, because joining without having converged would create problems. So we have a joint interest in this convergence exercise being as successful as possible and as well checked as possible. I guess that this was what the person you mentioned wanted to say. First of all, we have decided together to put our destiny in common in having a single currency. And when I say that, I say what has been said in all countries, but certainly also in the country that you were mentioning. And it is clear that we look at 307 million people ourselves and we have to, just as the Federal Reserve looks at Alaska, California, Florida, Massachusetts and all the other states, and there are differences and indirect taxation can be raised in various states, so we are not in the presence of something which is new or aberrant. We are in a universe where we have to look at the full body of a very vast continental (including Ireland) economy. It is not the first time that we have had to cope with that problem. We already had increases in administered prices and indirect taxation all over Europe. It was one of our problems over the last years. One of the difficulties was that we had to cope with these decisions and when they were all added up the order of magnitude was substantial in terms of inflation. So, it is not that new. It cannot be presented as a quid pro quo between an institution which has the responsibility for a global currency with 307 million people and a particular state. But of course we have to take into account those figures proportionally with the importance of the economy and the economy that you are mentioning is important, that is absolutely clear. Now, to say that the central bank of Germany was much more complacent would not fit with what I have seen and have read in all the German papers that were publishing articles in real time. I know that because I have been working with my friends in the Bundesbank during a great number of years. So I would not say that at all. I would say that, again, we will do our job. By doing our job, whatever is done by the various executive branches or parliaments, we are creating an environment which is obviously very favourable. And because you have quoted Germany let me say that at a recent lecture to which I was invited at the Bundesbank, Axel Weber said, and I repeated, that the present long-term rates in Germany are the lowest since Bismarck. So I do not know whether others were more efficient in delivering a financial environment which would be more favourable for growth and job creation, but it seems to me that we are trying at least to do our best and we have elements that would substantiate that we are doing everything we can to be credible in delivering price stability. By doing that, we are creating a financial environment which is obviously favourable for growth and job creation, but we all know and you all know that to have a favourable financial environment is a necessary condition. It is not, unfortunately, a sufficient condition per se. There are a number of elements for growth and job creation, but let me insist in conclusion, because your question was the last one, on confidence. In Europe today confidence is really very, very important. We are doing everything we can to improve and consolidate the confidence of households, entrepreneurs and investors. Particularly in difficult circumstances obviously like today’s, we will continue to be this anchor of confidence which is demanded by the situation. Thank you very much for your attention. "
2005-06-02,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure to welcome you to this press conference. The Vice‑President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. Overall, on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we expect euro area underlying inflationary pressures to remain contained in the medium term. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The exceptionally low level of interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum continues to provide considerable support to economic growth in the euro area, which currently shows only moderate dynamics. At the same time, we will remain vigilant with regard to upside risks to price stability. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, real GDP grew by 0.5% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2005, compared with 0.2% in the previous quarter. However, figures for real GDP growth over the last two quarters partly reflect statistical effects related to working-day adjustments to the data. This has led to some understatement of growth dynamics in the last quarter of 2004 and to some overstatement in the first quarter of 2005. Most recent indicators for economic activity remain, on balance, on the downside The moderation in economic activity observed since mid-2004 is partly related to the rise in oil prices. Looking ahead, there is scope for positive fundamental factors to again shape the outlook, assuming that the effects from adverse developments gradually diminish. Notably, global economic activity is expected to remain strong, despite some moderation from the record levels observed last year. This continues to support euro area exports and should have a potential positive impact also on investment. Investment is expected to benefit from robust earnings, improvements in business efficiency and the very favourable financing conditions. At the same time, consumption growth is expected to develop in line with real income growth. This assessment is broadly consistent with the new Eurosystem staff projections, which will be published today. Euro area real GDP is projected to grow at rates of between 1.1% and 1.7% in 2005, and between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2006. Recent forecasts from international and private sector organisations give similar indications. In comparison with the March ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 have been adjusted slightly downwards. All in all, our judgement remains that real economic growth will gradually improve over the period ahead. At the same time, recent data have heightened the uncertainties surrounding the short-term evolution of domestic demand, and persistently high oil prices and global imbalances may pose downside risks to the projections for economic growth. Turning to price developments in the euro area, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in May, compared with 2.1% in April. Over the coming months, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to remain broadly around current levels. On the one hand, energy prices are exerting upward pressure on HICP inflation. On the other hand, underlying inflationary pressure has been rather contained and, on average, wage increases have remained moderate over recent quarters. According to the Eurosystem staff projections, average annual HICP inflation is seen to lie between 1.8% and 2.2% in 2005, and between 0.9% and 2.1% in 2006. Compared with the ECB staff projections published in March 2005, the inflation projections for 2005 have been revised slightly upwards and for 2006 slightly downwards. In 2006, this largely reflects the expected statistical effect of a planned health care reform in one euro area country, the Netherlands, which is estimated to imply a one-off reduction of 0.2 percentage point in the euro area inflation rate for 2006. This effect should be excluded from the assessment of the medium-term outlook for price stability. Taking into account the assumptions underlying the projections, upside risks to the inflation projections prevail. These risks relate notably to future oil price developments, indirect taxes and administered prices. Furthermore, ongoing vigilance is required in order to ensure that past price increases do not lead to second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. In this respect, continued responsibility on the part of social partners is very important. The monetary analysis provides further insight into the risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Over the past few months, money and credit have continued to grow robustly in the euro area. These developments mainly reflect the stimulative effect of the low level of interest rates in the euro area. The monetary dynamics are driven by the strong growth of the most liquid components of broad money contained in the narrow aggregate M1. At the same time, the euro area private sector’s demand for MFI loans, in particular for house purchase, has remained strong. The assessment of ample liquidity in the euro area is confirmed by all indicators. Also in the light of the increasingly liquid nature of monetary expansion, the accumulated stock of the broad monetary aggregate M3 may entail upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained in the medium term. At the same time, it is necessary to underline the conditionality of this assessment and the related upside risks to price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for ongoing vigilance. As regards fiscal policies, developments in the euro area remain of concern. While a few countries are succeeding in maintaining sound budgetary positions, in several countries it is essential that fiscal consolidation is given the highest priority in view of the budgetary situation. Moreover, the revised rules and procedures for the Stability and Growth Pact, expected to take effect soon, need to be implemented in a strict manner to ensure credibility and to promote a timely return to sound budgetary positions. With respect to structural reforms, the so-called “Integrated Guidelines” for 2005-2008, covering both the new Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the new Employment Guidelines, are soon to be adopted. These guidelines for economic and employment policies will, in turn, serve as the basis for action at the EU level and for Member States to draw up national reform programmes by the autumn of this year. The new governance structure of the Lisbon agenda should provide new impetus to structural reforms in Europe. These reforms are vital for Europe's ability to respond to the challenges arising from an ongoing deepening in the global division of labour, the fast process of technological change and the ageing of the population. A determined approach in addressing these challenges and successful communication that convinces the public of the benefits of the reforms hold the key to both improving the economic outlook in the short run and sustaining the prosperity of European citizens in the longer term. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * First of all, I would fully confirm that after having had a long and thorough discussion in the Governing Council, we were unanimous in thinking that our interest rates are at the appropriate level for ensuring price stability; for delivering price stability in line with our definition; for, I would say also, reassuring households and consolidating their confidence that their purchasing power will be protected; for continuing to anchor inflationary expectations at the present level, which is in line with our definition of price stability; and for creating conditions that are very favourable to growth and job creation. I repeat: on the basis of all the information that we have today and all the signals which are coming from conjunctural indicators, economic analysis and monetary analysis, we think that our present monetary policy stance is appropriate, the best to be faithful to our mandate and therefore the best to foster economic growth and job creation in Europe. And, of course, I have to mention on behalf of the Governing Council that we are fully conscious of our own mandate, of the situation, that is, the situation of a European institution which is a federal institution with the responsibility of a single currency. We will be solid, we will be steady, we will be resolute and we will do all we can to improve confidence in the present period of time. I will only say that I do not comment on absurd questions. And if your question were to be whether or not there is a likelihood for California, Alaska or Florida to have their own currencies, I would do exactly the same. This is complete nonsense. Well, ask those who are shaping such absurd ideas. I also have to refer to Hans Eichel and Axel Weber who said yesterday, if I am not mistaken, that this was totally absurd. It is totally absurd and I will not comment any more on that. Again, no more than if I were to be asked a question on California or Texas. I will respond first to the second question. The confidence issue is a very important one. We are convinced of that. We are also convinced that, as a federal institution in Europe with very important responsibility for guarding the currency for 306 million citizens, we have part of the confidence of our fellow citizens in our own hands. It is absolutely crucial that they continue to have confidence in our capacity to ensure price stability and in the delivery of price stability. It is very important because, as you know, we still have some difference between real inflation and the inflation perceived by our fellow citizens. The message which is coming from the analysis we do on sentiment among our fellow citizens is that they are calling upon us very clearly to fully deliver price stability. That is something which comes out of surveys and analyses, including the analyses made by the European Commission. We also believe that improving confidence, particularly in the consumer constituency and in the household constituency in general, would be a very important means to foster growth and job creation. I will say here that our fellow citizens can trust us. We are here to give them price stability. They still have some doubt that we will really deliver price stability. We reassure them. The Governing Council of the ECB is telling them: yes, we will ensure price stability. You can trust us. If you have the intention to embark on an increase in consumption and you are still hesitating because you have some lack of confidence, you can do it – perhaps it is time to consume. At least, if it depends on us, we will do everything necessary to ensure price stability. We know that we have a responsibility as regards overall confidence among our fellow citizens and households. We also know what their message to us is. As regards entrepreneurs and confidence among entrepreneurs, I would also say that because we are credible, all recent surveys we have done on inflation expectations are giving us 1.9% as regards most of the survey that we are doing, which is a very good anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with our definition of price stability – less than, close to 2%. It is difficult to be closer to 2% than 1.9%. And the last figure I have in mind, for break-even inflation – extracted from indexed bonds – is 1.97%. Less than 2%, close to 2% – very close to 2%! The fact that we have solidly anchored inflation expectations, I would say thanks to our own monetary policy, permits a yield curve which is exceptionally favourable. That should help fostering confidence among investors in general and entrepreneurs in particular. I am telling them: perhaps it is time to invest. You have, in terms of financing, an exceptionally favourable environment. An environment which we believe is optimal under the present circumstances. And if we moved interest rates, either down or up, we believe that it could increase medium- and long-term market rates, not decrease them. And then it could have an impact which would be negative in comparison with the present monetary and financial environment, which again, as far the financial environment is concerned, is exceptionally favourable to growth and to job creation. As regards the first question that you asked, we had again a very thorough examination of the situation, and we were unanimous in concluding that the present rates were appropriate and optimal. We discussed the situation and we concluded unanimously that was appropriate. As I said, we are one of the European institutions, and a European institution with a very important responsibility. We have the chance to live in a political democracy. Each and every one of the 25 members of the European Union is a democracy, has to be a democracy to be part of the European Union. And we have a democratic life at the level of Europe at a whole. I fully subscribe to what has been said by the President of the European Union, the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament on what was their appreciation after what has been observed in France and then in the Netherlands. Of course, I have also to mention that ten countries have ratified the Constitution. Therefore we have a large number of messages, of signals, that are communicated to us. I would say that: it reinforced our sentiment of responsibility. The sentiment that we have is that improving confidence is really of the essence. It is what we try to do in the present exceptional circumstances. It is not customary in this institution to comment on exchange rates on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis. So, I have no particular comment. I will not comment on this evolution. We are living in a system which everybody knows. And if and when I have something to say, I say it. First of all, as regards the discussion we had. Again, we had a very thorough discussion, a unanimous discussion. We unanimously think that the present interest rates are appropriate. And that if we would move them, we would not augment our faithfulness to our mandate and would not improve the financial environment from the standpoint of growth and job creation. But we would worsen it. So, again, this is a very firm sentiment of the Governing Council itself. As regards the yield curve, of course, market interest rates depend on the global appreciation of risks and also on the global supply and demand of capital, which influences real interest rates. What we are very proud of is that – that depends on us - solidly anchor had been at our level and therefore authorises a lower level of market interest rates. You know that we have very low inflationary expectations even on a very long-term fifty-year basis, which represents something in terms of the long-term credibility of this institution and of the stability of the euro that we are issuing ourselves. We are proud of that. We consider that it is not only our mandate, and we will be faithful to our mandate, but it is also very good, again, for growth and job creation in Europe. And I draw your attention, because we are now seven years after the setting-up of the ECB. It is an important anniversary. Who would have thought that I would be able to tell you seven years later that for 306 million inhabitants, twelve countries, the sentiment of households, market participants, operators, savers, in Europe and in the rest of the world, is that we will have, as I said, in the medium- and long-term 1.9% inflation, or 1.97% inflation when we extract the break-even inflation from index bonds. Nobody would have believed. Because it was really something which appeared extraordinarily difficult to achieve. And I do not hesitate to say: in the eyes of most, a very wide majority of, observers, impossible to achieve. So we did that. And it is something which, I have to stress, is very important. It is very important also for the households of Europe. They are not telling us that we should not be vigilant on inflation. Ask them. And you will see. Look at the Survey. Look at all the information we have. They are calling upon us to be, again, faithful to our mandate. And to guarantee them that they can rely on their own purchasing power. Sometimes I am told, we are told with my colleagues in the Governing Council: “Look, perhaps you should be a little less demanding on price stability. Why not go up to 3%? You said close to 2/below 2%? Okay, why not close to 3/below 3%?” What would it mean exactly? In terms of our yield curve? In your opinion? It would mean immediately that all market interest rates will have to augment by 100 basis points at least. Because if we say that our definition of price stability is 3% instead of 2 – okay, let’s go up. 1.97% transformed into 2.97%. 100 basis points. And on top, this increase of 100 basis points we would probably have an additional risk premium. Because if we are able to say, brutally, 2 is now transformed into 3 – why not tomorrow 3.5 or 4%? So you have to have an insurance premium against the risk of seeing further increases in the definition of price stability. So I really draw your attention to this: by being credible and successful in anchoring inflationary expectations we are delivering an exceptionally favourable yield curve for growth and job creation. But, of course, it is a necessary condition for growth. It is not a sufficient condition per se. We fully agree with that. And it is our firm belief, as the belief of other responsible authorities, that we also need structural reforms. First of all, I will say that market participants are market participants, which I fully respect. It is absolutely normal that they do not all have the same opinion. If they all had the same opinion, we would not have a functioning market. As regards examples of various central banks having had good experiences and bad experiences, I would suggest that you consult the academic literature, which is very abundant. When I compare our own bond rates to some others, I see that they are at a low level. And so they are incorporating inflationary expectations that are lower than others. I do not want to create a hit parade of the best inflationary expectations, but if you take bonds you know well and you extract the break-even and compare with ours, you can see what it means. We believe that by being very clear in the eyes of public opinion, households and market participants that we were vigilant, we have permitted precisely those inflationary expectations to remain firmly anchored. Vigilance is the normal posture of the central bank and considerably helps its medium and long-term success. We believe that we can prove that success in the economic and arithmetic studies that we carry out. I would say that we are in a challenging environment permanently. We started this institution seven years ago and we started a new currency six and a half years ago, we had no track record for the currency, no track record for the institution. We were really starting from scratch, something which was extraordinarily ambitious. It was a tremendous challenge. You judge whether or not we were up to that challenge. Remember also the degree of scepticism that we had to accept from some observers at the time. We live fortunately in a universe of free thought and free debate in public opinion. It is a great privilege that we have. We know that we have important responsibilities and we know that with a great level of responsibility comes possible criticism, possible observations of any sort. We accept this and we have a lot of debate here, a lot of colloquiums and seminars are organised, and we fully participate in the public debate. We believe in what we do and we are observed not just by all of you, but by the entire world. As regards the present climate, I let you judge, we are not in a universe of partisan debate. We are the guardian of a currency which is a public good for 306 million persons – whatever their sensitivities. We are independent precisely because everybody knows that we guard the currency for all, absolutely all, without any exception. I think that it is clear that as far as structural reforms – reforms in general – are concerned, we all have to explain as well as possible, to convince the people of Europe that everybody would be better off with the reforms. And when I say that everybody would be better off, principally it means mass unemployment would diminish in those economies that unfortunately have mass unemployment. In the economies where structural reforms have been implemented, you do not have mass unemployment, which is a fantastic improvement. So that is the great challenge of our time, and we do not exclude ourselves from that challenge, we consider that we have a role to play. We are not lecturing anybody, we are trying to help in convincing public opinion that we would be better off with reforms. We know that it is not easy. Perhaps you could interpret what has been observed here and there as precisely part of the difficulty of this pedagogic challenge, this communication challenge which is a challenge for governments, parliaments, opinion leaders in general and also for this institution. As I said, we do not exclude ourselves from this very important and demanding challenge. Again, I have to say very firmly that when we look at the dispersion of growth, for instance, or the dispersion of inflation in this vast continental economy which is called the euro area, with 306 million people, and we compare that with a vast continental economy which is called the United States of America, with a little less than 306 million inhabitants, there are figures which can be computed in terms of standard deviation for growth and for inflation. If you take yearly growth, you have, on the basis of 2004 figures, 1.7% for the states of the United States and1.3% for the 12 states of the euro area. The orders of magnitude are the same. Of course this has to be looked at very carefully: there is not the same number of entities in the two unions – the American union and the euro area. If I take the year-on-year standard deviation in Europe on the basis of the first quarter of 2005, I have a figure of 1.2 %, which is the lowest level since 1999. It does not at all document a difference of nature between the American union as a vast continental economy and the euro area as a vast continental economy. It shows that we are very close. As regards the evolution over time, we do not observe change in this standard deviation figure. As regards inflation, the figures are even more striking, and the number of areas is more comparable: 12 economies and nations in the euro area, 14 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. If you compute the standard deviation as regards inflation you have 0.9% on both sides of the Atlantic. Again, I do not draw from that a definitive conclusion, but I want you to know this, to have these figures and to see the extent to which there is perhaps from time to time an over-amplification of issues. Hans Eichel said something yesterday which I very much agree with. As well as Axel Weber. The euro is a success, and some theories are absurd and do not deserve comments We say very clearly that structural reform is necessary to improve the functioning of the European economy. And we are not the only institution to say that: we have the unanimity of the Council, which has been repeated in Brussels recently after Lisbon, and we have the position of the Commission. So, we could certainly improve in this respect in comparison with the United States, but it would be unfair to say that we have only defects on this side of the Atlantic and that there are only assets and qualities on the other side. You know well that on the other side of the Atlantic they have big problems too, including a lack of savings, domestic imbalances and external imbalances. If we want to be just, we must say that we all have homework to do. On the first question, if I was preparing for a rate cut, I would tell you something which would permit you to think “well, they are preparing a rate cut”. I am not telling you anything that would be interpreted as suggesting we are preparing a rate cut. I told you we think that the present rates are appropriate and fully in line with what would be best for us to be faithful to our mandate and foster growth and job creation in Europe. Mr Rato is the Managing Director of the IMF. You could also have quoted Mr Johnson and the chief economist of the OECD. Perhaps in this room we also have editorialists that are very keen on advising us to increase rated and even perhaps think that we should have increased rates for quite a period of time. I am not fingering out anybody. So we have received very good advice, and there is also the advice which comes from the people of Europe, which is: be faithful to your mandate. And I am not only referring to the people of the country where we stand, I am referring to all people of Europe. We take all that into account. They are all well inspired, I know that, and they are all taking account of a lot of information that is filtered by particular institutions or individuals. I do not suggest that any of these institutions or individuals do not do their job. We have also our own job. We are responsible as guardian of the currency, nobody else. We are responsible and we take fully that responsibility. I didn’t see this poll and I am a little bit surprised by the figures you are mentioning but I accept it fully. I would only say that there is no difference between the DM and the euro as regards the credibility of the currency, as regards the solidity of the currency, as regards the capacity of the currency to inspire confidence, and this can be proved not by literature or abstract theory but by academic research, arithmetic, mathematical, economic research: Look at the yield curve, look at the inflationary expectations. This is something which is a fact and this is very important. What you are saying, Madame, is what I said myself. The people in the street are calling upon us to be faithful to our mandate, to deliver a currency which would be as good as any national currency before the euro. It is what we are doing and we are succeeding, it can be proved, including in Germany, and I know the attachment of the German people to a solid currency, a currency which would inspire confidence. I say that all the people of Europe, the 306 million, are calling for a currency which would inspire confidence, preserve purchasing power, permit them to project themselves with confidence into the future and I hope very much that some of them will consume more and, again, I told them to do so: “It is time to consume, you can be sure that we will preserve your purchasing power”. Again, we are responsible according to the Treaty and they [the people] know pretty well from experience, particularly in Germany, that the central bank has the responsibility for issuing a currency, and they are asking for the currency to be credible. But we have a number of other conditions which have to be met to have growth in a satisfactory fashion. We all agree on that, but as far as we are concerned, by being faithful to our mandate, we are delivering. Observe the market risk that we have in front of us. Observe that the loans to the private sector in the euro area are growing twice as fast as the GDP in value terms. Everybody sees that we do all we can by being faithful to our mandate to have an environment which would be as favourable as possible to growth. Again, the diagnosis is that we need reform if we want to be in a better shape as regards growth and job creation. We all agree on that. The only thing that you can draw from all that has been said in the Introductory Statement and from what I have said now is that we remain vigilant. That continued vigilance is of the essence. And everybody knows that if we had to do something to guard against inflationary risks, we would do it. We have not promised anything to anybody. And it is because we are vigilant, and everybody knows that we are vigilant, that we have this solid anchoring of low inflationary expectations that I have been talking about. "
2005-05-04,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Berlin. Today is the 11th time that the Governing Council has met outside Frankfurt, and I would like to thank President Weber for his invitation and hospitality. Let me also express our gratitude to the staff of the Deutsche Bundesbank for their excellent organisation of today’s meeting. Let me now report on the outcome of today’s meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we continue to see no significant evidence of a build-up of underlying domestic inflationary pressures in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The exceptionally low level of interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum provides considerable support to economic activity in the euro area. At the same time, continued vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted. Allow me to elaborate on our decision, turning first to the economic analysis. Regarding the current situation and the short-term outlook for economic activity, recent data and survey indicators are, on balance, on the downside. Some of the downward risks to economic growth identified earlier, in particular those related to persistently high oil prices, appear to have partially materialised over the past few months. At the same time, when looking beyond the short term, conditions remain in place for stronger real GDP growth. On the external side, euro area exports should continue to be supported by foreign demand. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the very favourable financing conditions, the robust corporate earnings currently being observed and ongoing improvements in corporate efficiency. Consumption growth should evolve broadly in line with expected developments in disposable income. Downside risks to economic growth continue to be related to oil price developments and global imbalances. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in April, unchanged from March. Over the coming months, annual HICP inflation rates are likely to remain around these levels. Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of moderate economic growth and weak labour markets, this trend should continue for the time being. Overall, when looking ahead, we see no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area so that inflation rates should develop in line with price stability. However, there continue to be upside risks to price stability, relating mainly to oil price developments and their potential to lead to second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting behaviour. In order to avoid this, it is important that the social partners continue to assume their responsibilities. As regards the monetary analysis, monetary and credit growth remain strong despite some moderation over the recent past. These developments mainly reflect the stimulative effect of the low level of interest rates in the euro area. As monetary dynamics over the past year have mainly been driven by developments in the most liquid components of M3, this continues to signal upside risks to price stability in the medium to longer term. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained. However, upside risks to price stability over the medium term need to be monitored closely. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of such risks. Against this background, longer-term inflation expectations need to be monitored closely. As regards fiscal policies, recent information and forecasts suggest little progress in reducing fiscal imbalances in the euro area. A timely and full implementation of consolidation commitments is essential. This will strengthen the confidence of investors and consumers in the soundness of economic policies. At the same time, it is essential to implement, in a strict and timely manner, the revised Stability and Growth Pact procedures, which are soon to enter into force, so as to underpin the credibility of the EU fiscal framework. The Governing Council has repeatedly argued in favour of structural reforms to improve the potential for higher economic growth in the euro area. Authorities are aware of the structural obstacles and have taken important measures to address them, but continued reforms will be needed in order to keep up with the unavoidable challenges arising from an ongoing deepening in the division of labour at the global level, rapid technological change and population ageing. It is important to explain to the general public that these reforms will progressively deliver higher growth and lead to more job creation, and that, as a result, our societies will be better off. Over recent years, uncertainties surrounding the structural reform agenda in some euro area countries appear to have hindered the necessary improvement in the confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs. A clear commitment to implementing the reforms and the explanation of their benefits will help to reduce such uncertainties and thereby make a considerable contribution to improving the economic outlook for the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * It was not a “strong statement”. It was a mention of the position we have had for a long time. I said on behalf of the Governing Council a long time ago that a decrease of rates was not an option. And I can confirm that this meeting has seen no change to our previous analysis or to the conclusion that we reached a month ago. Our attitude is to wait and see. We undertook a very thorough analysis of the situation and we believe that the interest rates are in line with what is required by our overall economic and monetary analysis. And I would like to draw your attention to the following point: our short-term intervention rates are exceptionally low. Together with all market interest rates, they are creating an environment which is extremely favourable to growth and job creation in Europe. And it is because we are credible in terms of our own delivery of price stability that we are benefiting from these very low medium and long-term market rates. This is an exceptional contribution to the economic situation in the euro area. These very low market rates are based on the vigilance and credibility that we have in delivering price stability. Do not forget that inflationary expectations are priced in the level of market interest rates we are observing on a ten-year basis, where the benchmark is around 3.40. The fact that oil prices are high and have been so for a number of months is, in itself, an element which calls for vigilance. And that is the reason why we have called on all price-setting economic agents and social partners to act responsibly. If inflationary expectations are in line with our definition of price stability, it is because all observers think, that thanks to our own vigilance triggering appropriate behaviour of price-setters and social partners, no second-round effects will be observed. This is of the essence, both for price stability and for growth and job creation in Europe. Let us be absolutely clear: we are certainly not preparing for a rate cut. Not at all, for a very simple reason. As I said, we consider that our contribution, being faithful to our mandate, is to deliver price stability. The risks to price stability are still there. When we look at the inflationary expectations we consider three kinds of surveys. One is being done by ourselves, one is being done by the private sector, and one is being done by the European Commission. They all point to inflationary expectations in the medium to long run being at 1.9%. 1.9% is below but very close to 2%. That sole observation will call for us to maintain a position of vigilance. Because, if economic agents think that the delivery of price stability will be 1.9 %, it is because they believe that we will be vigilant. So again, we are considering the situation and are convinced that by maintaining the interest rates at their present level and by maintaining a position of vigilance at the same time, we are doing what is needed to be faithful to our mandate and to maintain and preserve a financial environment that is exceptionally favourable to growth and job creation We let observers and market participants make their own judgement. We are very clear that on the basis of our analysis, the present level of our intervention rate is fully in line with what we judge appropriate in view of our own mandate. Everybody knows that if we were called to increase rates, we would do so. And again, we are credible because we have not said anything else to market participants. There is no contradiction at all between being faithful to our mandate and preserving an environment as favourable as possible for growth and job creation. You know that ten-year rates at the level of 3.4% is something that, before the setting up of the euro, would have been considered impossible to deliver to the 306 million inhabitants of the euro area. So, it is something which is obviously extremely favourable for growth and job creation. I have to stress this point again and again because delivering a favourable financial environment is a necessary condition for growth and job creation, but it is not a sufficient condition per se. There are other conditions, and these certainly include the structural reforms that I have mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council. Among these conditions there is also confidence. The confidence of the households and the confidence of the entrepreneurs are very important. We, ourselves, are an institution which is profoundly devoted to confidence – to inspiring and consolidating confidence. We could say that price stability and the present environment, which we are helping to create on the financial side, are elements of confidence for the households. We tell the households that they can trust us to deliver price stability and, if they intend to consume, we would certainly tell them they can consume with confidence and that, of course, would be an element of growth. We would say the same to the entrepreneurs: you have an environment which is exceptionally favourable to physical investment in Europe with the present long and medium-term market rates, and there are a lot of good reasons to have confidence and to invest. As regards your first question it has always been our intimate conviction that a resolute attitude, positive in the direction of structural reforms - along the line which was agreed upon by the Lisbon European Council in 2000 on a proposal of the Commission and has been confirmed several times, including during the important Brussels European Council -should progressively increase confidence. It is our intimate conviction and I trust there is a consensus on that. The problem is the difficulty of the delivery, and we have said how important it is to explain why society as a whole would be better off with the delivery of these reforms. We consider that we are part of this explanation exercise and I take the present occasion that you offer me to confirm that, i.e. to say that we are absolutely convinced that the entire society will progressively be better off with the delivery of those structural reforms. As regards the fiscal outlook, our main message is that we are about to have, in a short span of time, a new framework – and I don’t want to go back to what our position is: you know it. I have repeated it a number of times. We call now for the full and strict implementation required by the text, and that is the main message. For the last point, the question was already asked: we firmly believe that our mandate calls for maintaining interest rates where they are and that if we were to go in the direction which is from time to time suggested we would not get a decrease in rates. We would get an increase in rates, it is as simple as that! Because we would be considered by economic agents, market participants, observers, investors and savers as being less credible as regards delivering price stability over time; then they would augment their inflationary expectations. Those higher inflationary expectations, as augmented, would be incorporated in market rates, and then this “good advice” would lead to a result which would be exactly the contrary of the result which is hoped for, I presume. And that’s the reason why we trust that we have the appropriate level of interest rates at the moment I am speaking. First point, we incorporate absolutely all elements, as you know, when we proceed with the economic analysis. So, all parameters that are of importance are taken into account. Certainly, the price of oil, the price of commodities – which we did not mention explicitly in our communiqué – all elements that we can observe at the global level, including what has been observed in emerging Asia and so forth, as well, of course, as the constellation of exchange rates: we take all of this into account when we make our judgement. As you have seen, we consider that when we look beyond the short term, the conditions are there for growth to get progressively closer to what we would call the growth potential of the euro area. As far as asset prices are concerned, we did not mention the point in this communiqué. It does not mean at all that things have substantially changed, and I would say that our analysis is the same. We see a number of economies, a number of countries in the euro area, where we have phenomena that are combining very dynamic growth of credit and elements of asset prices that need to be monitored. But as I have said already, perhaps on the occasion of the last two or three press conferences, it is not – at this stage – alarming at the level of the euro area as a whole. As you know, we certainly do not embark at the level of the Governing Council of the ECB on any such precise profile projections. As you also know, the projections which are made by the staff of the Eurosystem or the staff of the ECB are not necessarily underwritten by us. We do not endorse the projections which are made, even by our own collaborators, at the level of the Governing Council. We consider that we must look at all that is said, including what is said by the private sector, by the international institutions, and as you know, they are very much converging in the same direction as our staff projections. There is a very small difference between the various institutions concerned. As far as our own staff are concerned, you also know that, since we first embarked on the publication of these projections, they have produced quite large bands to capture the degree of uncertainty. And as regards my own position, you might remember that last time, and even two months ago, I said in response to a question like yours that “I am not optimistic, I am not pessimistic, I am realistic”. We in the Governing Council look at facts and figures and we take facts and figures as the information which is crucial for our own considerations. The Governing Council, as I said, has looked at facts and figures and on balance has considered that a number of them were on the downward side on a short-term basis. But I will not elaborate more on that. Again, we are realistic. First of all, I said – and I am deeply convinced of the lessons that we can draw from all evolution; I am speaking in Berlin and I am always moved to be in Berlin myself, because I knew Berlin divided, I knew Berlin with the Mauer, I knew Berlin in totally different times – and so we know that the market economy lays down the rules that permit to create wealth, and that is extremely important. We also know, of course, that political democracy calls for discussion and for thought on how to get the best out of this wealth. But wealth has to be produced, and it is a clear lesson of the past, a difficult past – a terrible past in some respects – that these rules of market economy are key to produce goods. You can see that here in Europe. You can see that also so clearly in Asia – in emerging Asia. I will not pronounce, myself, on a particular debate in some countries that are members of the euro area. Weber: No, I would not embark on that debate either, except to say that it is our assessment that in Europe we are moving towards a common market – a common market for goods and services – and we have a European framework for integrating financial markets. We look at reality and we judge that this reality is one of liberalising financial markets and having Europe grow together. In particular, here from this site in Berlin, over the last decades we have all seen the advantage of this liberalisation and of the growing together of Europe. This is the direction in which we should focus the economic debate and this is the main issue that is of concern to us at the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the Eurosystem. We have to establish a common European framework and financial markets. We have to grow together. I think this should be the main debate that we have in the months and years ahead: how we can make Europe work better? I would only like to add that we are an “apolitical institution” or a “multi-partisan institution”. We are guarding, defending and preserving a public good, which is the single currency. We have to guard this public good with standards that are extremely high, because we have to continue delivering a single currency which, according to the promise which was made, is at least as good as the best previous national currencies. And we were created ourselves by the virtue of a multi-national and multi-partisan consensus. A strong will to create the ECB. First of all, we in the Governing Council are strongly in favour of the level playing-field, the single market, the further integration of the financial markets. This is very clear and has been said several times. Second, I don’t want to qualify what is going on in any particular country. I am sure that the European rules will be respected and that we will see the appropriate functioning of the single market for financial services. This is my own working assumption and, again, this would be in line with the idea of having an integrated financial market and financial services market at the level of Europe as a whole. On this first question, the work of economists on determining the growth potential of any economy is being carried out permanently. It is a very complex question. There are various methodologies. You also have the introduction of the idea that you have a medium-term growth potential and perhaps a longer-term growth potential. Therefore I draw your attention to the fact that this is a very stimulating and interesting issue on which we are all working, including the OECD, for instance, which has done quite a lot of work on this issue. I don’t exclude the possibility that in the latest review of growth potential for various European economies and for the euro area as a whole, for the European Union as a whole, we might discover that the consensus of economists goes in the direction of revising down previous estimates. I don’t want to be definite, but at the same time I don’t exclude it, and, of course, the dynamism of the population is part of this, as well as the projections for labour productivity increases. As regards our own understanding, I would not have any kind of conclusion in the direction you are presently suggesting, i.e. that we should revise down the 4.5% target. As you know, we have to look at our monetary analysis reference, and we will do that. As regards the second question, on ERM II: I refer again to the fact that we are in Berlin, a reunified Berlin, which is a very powerful and emblematic illustration of the unification of Germany. We also have a powerful illustration of the reunification of Europe as a whole, and it is moving. For the Governing Council, to consider that, in ERM II, we now have seven currencies, namely the Danish krone and the currencies of six of the ten newcomers, is very telling. It is a very heavy responsibility for all of us, for the countries concerned, for the governments of the countries concerned – the six I mentioned – for their central banks, for us, for the euro area. We all agree that convergence is of the essence, that succeeding in the convergence exercise is something which is of extreme importance and that we have no right not to succeed fully in this exercise. We are all taking extremely seriously the presence of these six currencies in ERM II and we will continue to carry out our actions together with the newcomers as responsibly and professionally and efficiently as possible to prepare, when the time comes, when convergence has been achieved and when criteria have been met, for what could be the next step. My message is a message of professionalism and of seriousness, because it is a very serious process and, at the same time, it shows that history is moving impressively. "
2005-04-07,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure to welcome you to this press conference. The Vice‑President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. All in all, we have not changed our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. So far, we have seen no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Both nominal and real interest rates are at exceptionally low levels, lending ongoing support to economic activity. However, upside risks to price stability over the medium term remain and continued vigilance is therefore of the essence. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. Recent data and survey indicators on economic activity have been mixed. In general they point to ongoing economic growth at a moderate pace over the short term, with no clear signs as yet of a strengthening in underlying dynamics. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for moderate economic growth to continue. Global growth remains solid, providing a favourable environment for euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment is expected to continue to be supported by very favourable financing conditions, improved profits and greater business efficiency. Consumption growth should develop in line with real disposable income growth. However, at the same time, persistently high oil prices in particular pose downside risks to growth. Turning to consumer prices, Eurostat’s flash estimate for annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in March, unchanged from February. In the coming months, annual inflation rates are likely to remain somewhat above 2%, although the exact figure will depend largely on how oil prices develop. Looking further ahead, so far we have seen no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of moderate economic growth and weak labour markets, this trend is likely to continue for the time being. However, upside risks to price stability remain. Given recent oil price rises, it is once again paramount that second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting throughout the economy are avoided. It is particularly important that the social partners assume their responsibilities in this respect. In addition, developments in longer-term inflation expectations need to be monitored closely. The monetary analysis provides further insight into the outlook for price developments at medium to longer-term horizons. While the latest monetary and credit data show some moderation in the pace of monetary expansion, they confirm that the stimulative effect of the low level of interest rates has remained the dominating force. In addition, the fact that monetary dynamics continue to be driven mainly by the most liquid components suggests that excess liquidity may entail risks of upward inflationary pressures in the medium to longer term. Furthermore, strong monetary and credit growth indicates the need to carefully monitor whether risks are building up in the context of strong house price increases in some regions of the euro area. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained, while there continue to be medium-term upside risks to price stability which need to be monitored closely. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of such risks. Turning to fiscal policies, recent information provides a mixed picture and continues to raise concerns. Although public finances remain sound in a few euro area countries and fiscal consolidation is progressing slowly in others, in several countries fiscal perspectives are worrying, as imbalances are not projected to decline, as planned earlier, and in some cases are even forecast to rise. Given that inappropriate consolidation strategies and shortcomings in their implementation have, in the past, made compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact difficult, it is now essential that consolidation plans are ambitious and are fully implemented. It is equally essential that the European Commission and the ECOFIN Council strictly enforce the new agreement on the implementation of the Pact so as to restore the framework’s credibility. The Governing Council would also like to reiterate the need to deliver on fiscal and structural reforms that enhance the sustainability of public finances and confidence in the growth prospects of all Member States. As regards structural reforms in the euro area, the Governing Council welcomes the Presidency Conclusions of the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005, which state that “it is essential to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy without delay and re-focus priorities on growth and employment”. EU countries urgently need to promote innovation and human capital formation, establish a regulatory environment which is friendlier for businesses, accelerate market liberalisation, and increase labour market flexibility. Attention must now shift towards implementing this reform agenda. Closing the implementation gap is essential in order to reap the full benefits of structural reforms in terms of both a higher growth potential in the medium term and improved consumer and business confidence in the short term. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * *  Our judgement is that we are presently observing moderate growth and we are vigilant. We are in an environment where all information is very important for us. We are capturing the mixed signals I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council. As regards forecasts, I was struck by the fact that a lot of forecasters – our own (the staff of the ECB), the Commission, the private sector, international institutions – are very close when you look at what they are projecting for this year and next year. As you know, we only provide ranges ourselves, capturing also the concept of uncertainty as regards what could happen. A number of other forecasters deliver precise figures. And when I look at these figures, whether they are from the European Commission, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Consensus Economics forecasts, and so forth, they are very close. There is some kind of consensus on the present projections. Again, we are making the working assumption that we will progressively see this moderate ongoing growth develop, but we are very pragmatic. We are waiting for confirmation, facts and figures. I will let Axel tell you what he has to say on the Bundesbank’s strategy. I have absolutely no comment on that. As you know, we did not change our own Governing Council position, the ECB position, which is very simple, has been reiterated many times and was crystallised when we observed sharp moves upwards. I have nothing to add to that. But it is our clear-cut position. It is absolutely unchanged. There is no “usual” sentence on the evolution of inflation. We are not in a world where we repeat sentences. We are saying what we think, taking account of all the information we have. I remember that at a time when inflation was reasonably low – below 2% – I said there would be a hump. We said that in advance, which was very important to avoid any misunderstanding with observers, markets or investors. I think it is our duty to be as clear as possible on that. It’s absolutely clear that the recent, very significant increases in the price of oil – together with a number of other factors, but the price of oil is certainly a very important one – have to be taken into account. This is the reason why I mentioned that in the months to come we would perhaps observe a level above 2%. That is absolutely clear. It was important for us to say that in advance, and it is associated with the increase of the price of oil. As regards the longer-term perspective, we see it is also clear that we think – this is the reason why we did not increase rates – that we will deliver price stability in the medium-term in line of the definition of the Governing Council. I can also say on oil prices that we are now at levels which are very, very high. We have to be pragmatic, to respect facts and figures, and that is what we do. Oil price has an impact both on inflation, which we have just mentioned, and also on growth. It is the usual impact of an oil shock. It has a depressive impact on growth; it has an inflationary impact on the HICP. This is something which is very unwelcome, for global economic growth in general, and it is also very unwelcome for the euro area. I myself signed the G7 communiqué calling for the oil market to function better and to improve transparency, and I will reiterate that goal: as high a level of responsibility as possible from all partners concerned, whether they are producers or consumers. I would also mention that I could see one of the producers had decided to produce as much as possible without any other limit than its own capacity. It is certainly a welcome decision. I also think that it is important for consumers to be as good energy savers as possible. As you know, we have protected ourselves in the euro area and in Europe in general since the first and second oil shocks and we are benefiting from that situation in comparison with what would have happened in the present very difficult circumstances had we not made those energy saving efforts. We call for all of the consumers to be highly responsible in terms of energy consumption. As regards your second question, I would only say that I am making the working assumption that the Constitution will be approved. And, because you asked a question which is associated with the advantages that are due to the euro, I would only mention that if we have the very low level of market interest rates I have been mentioning for 306 million inhabitants it is thanks to the euro and thanks to the price stability credibility the Governing Council of the ECB are giving to the European and euro area economy. Let me also mention that in the present international environment we observe none of the intra-European turbulence that there would have been with the various national currencies before the euro. We would have had a lot of turbulence, a lot of difficulties, and not only on the exchange rate side, between the various European currencies, but also on the interest rate side, with a piling-up of risk premia, volatility and turbulence in the interest rate market. I mention all that because it is forgotten. We have the euro now; we have totally forgotten the difficulties and the drawbacks that were associated with the absence of the euro. It is a necessary reminder. A decrease of rates is not an option for the Governing Council. There was no discussion in today’s Governing Council meeting of an increase of rates. We all considered that the present level of interest rates was in line with our overall assessment, which I have summed up in the introductory statement, and so we consider that we have the right level of interest rates. As you have noted, I also mentioned that vigilance was of the essence. We have not observed up to now secondary effects, which would be detrimental for inflation and for growth in Europe. It is because all observers know that we are vigilant and that vigilance is of the essence. They all know that, if needed, we would immediately increase rates. There is no doubt about that, it seems to me, in the perception of observers and market participants. And it is because they know this that we are not observing secondary effects and that present inflationary expectations – in particular the longer-term inflationary expectations over five years and ten years – are in line with our definition of price stability. It is because everybody knows that we are vigilant. And the contradiction, which I hear from time to time, between price stability on the one hand and to growth and job creation, on the other hand, does not exist. In being credible on price stability, and in being credible because we are vigilant, we are permitting these low inflationary expectations and, therefore, a yield curve, which is exceptionally favourable to growth and to job creation. It is also clear that if it is a necessary condition for growth and job creation, it is not a sufficient condition per se. We do everything that we can to preserve this favourable financial environment through price stability. On top of that, there are other conditions for growth and job creation and that do not depend on us. I have to be clear also on that. On bonds, it is a very, very interesting and stimulating question, on which a lot of academics and staff, including our own, are working to extract from the bond market all the information which would be pertinent. It is not sure that the bond market signals everywhere in the world – in the United States, in Europe – depressed sentiment on future growth. There are a number of other elements which are incorporated in the bond market evolution including a number of risk premia that might be very low in the present period for a number of reasons. There are also a number of factors that are coming from investors; for instance, it is clear that a number of pension funds and insurance businesses are shifting part of their investments into long, fixed interest rate securities and the bond market is influenced by that factor. So I would be very cautious – and more cautious than you are – in making the working assumption that what you can extract directly from the present bond market signals the fact that they incorporate depressed long-term growth. The consensus of international and national public institutions and of the private sector projections is that growth will be there. So again I do not see in the global consensus and in the European consensus a confirmation of what you said. In reply to the second question, again, we are very pragmatic. We are observing what is projected by our staff and by a number of other institutions. I will not elaborate on the second quarter or the third quarter of this year. I would only say that we are looking at facts and figures and we are seeing mixed signals from the various economies concerned. I already said here when I was asked “but are you optimistic?” that I am not optimistic, I am not pessimistic, I am a realist. We have to take reality into account permanently as far as our Governing Council responsibility is concerned. As regards the third question, I would say that we are in favour of European financial integration. We are not hiding that. It has been the overall strategy of Europe and I take it that it is the rule that we are all following and I will not embark on any qualification of any particular decision to be made, which I am sure will fully respect the European rules. Again, the only working assumption I am making is that the Constitution will be approved and ratified. I will not embark on a qualification of the sentiment, or the absence of sentiment, in any particular country. That is not my responsibility. I look at the euro area as a whole. I will only say that, as far as the euro is concerned, it seems to me that there is a tendency to forget the situation before the euro. And this is the reason why I mentioned earlier that before the euro we had a number of difficulties, drawbacks and very important risks that we had to cope with. Of course, the benefit of good decision is that those kinds of risks and difficulties are eliminated, but you then forget the risks and the difficulties. I have to mention that because I believe that it is something that is important. Other than that, I will respect European democracy. You know that we are ourselves an institution which has enormous responsibility and we are responsible for a large part, a significant amount of the confidence, because confidence in Europe is very much based upon the sentiment that price stability is ensured. And I would only say that we will remain a sanctuary of confidence, an anchor of confidence. And I would also tell the European households who are hesitating – and a number of them are reluctant to consume because they fear future possible price instability – I would tell them “No, we are here to ensure that you have price stability and you have your purchasing power protected. And if you intend to consume, do not hesitate. Go ahead and do what you have in mind. Have confidence in the fact that, as far as our responsibility is concerned, we will live up to that responsibility”. And my second question to you is: given the apparent effects, curious effects, interesting effects that excess liquidity is having on real estate prices in some parts of the euro area, perhaps on the bond market, has this led you to rethink how to best apply your strategy for the monetary pillar of the analysis? First question. Again, I do not want to bore you, but, as I have already said, we do not only influence an economy with short-term rates, or the shortest-term rates. Market rates are the rates that are important for economic agents on a three-month, six-month, two-year, five-year, ten-year, thirty-year, fifty-year basis. Fifty years also because, as you know, we now have issuance on a fifty-year basis. The Treaty says that we have to deliver price stability. If we are credible in delivering price stability, all the market interest rates that I have mentioned and all the yield curves will incorporate the inflation expectations for these periods of time, these various horizons. If the situation required us to raise interest rates and we did not do that “to help growth”, quote unquote, you yourself would judge that inflationary expectations had to be raised. And all the market rates at the various horizons would not go down; they would go up. So, we are absolutely convinced that, by delivering price stability, being vigilant and acting where necessary, we are helping the financial environment of Europe. We are not hampering it. It is as simple as that. And that is the reason why the response to your question is, for us, not that complicated. As regards real estate, I have mentioned that we are observing in some regions of Europe a phenomenon that needs to be monitored. It is clear that at this stage we think that we have to look at it carefully, to monitor it carefully. I would not say that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, we have an alarming situation. That said, I was sufficiently precise on our monetary analysis for you to see that we have there elements that are confirming that we have to remain vigilant. As I have said, vigilance is of the essence. But again, vigilance being of the essence does not mean that we are hampering the overall financial environment of the euro area. On the contrary. First of all, as you may know, we are a signatory to the Central Banks’ Gold Agreement that was published on 8 March 2004 following discussions by a number of central banks. Not only is the ECB a signatory, but we were also the first signatory to that press release, along with a large number of central banks from the euro area, from the European Union, as well as others. We participate fully in this agreement. There is, as you know, a ceiling that has been agreed upon as regards the 12-month period, which is of 500 tons. The Governing Council of the ECB decided to sell gold, which we thought appropriate to the overall reshaping of our reserve assets, in full compliance with the Agreement, as – it goes without saying – do all other signatories. This we made public recently, and it was very well understood by the market. We also indicated that it was not our intention to sell gold again during the first 12 months of the Agreement. Regarding possible sales of gold by the IMF, this is indeed an issue that is discussed in the IMF. I understand that there is no consensus but you have to ask the various partners concerned. My understanding of the current situation is that we are far from agreement. In terms of our own position, we would certainly be cautious in this respect. As central bankers, we have a central bankers’ approach. There are different legal arrangements from country to country: in some countries the decision is left to the Executive, whereas in other countries the decision is shared by the central bank and the Executive; still in others, the decision may be left entirely to the central bank. In most countries, this is a decision that will be taken, ultimately, by the Executive. As central bankers we say that development assistance should normally be financed through budgetary resources. That would be the normal financing of all development assistance rather than through the use of monetary assets. We would also say that, if the IMF embarked upon gold sales, it would perhaps be better, from the IMF’s standpoint, to use them to reinforce its own position – its financial position – rather than to finance debt relief. Again, the approach I describe is of a central banker. I would add that, if – despite the thoughts I am expressing, which are certainly shared by a number of partners and shareholders of the IMF and perhaps even large shareholders – a decision were taken, then it would be absolutely essential that it should not upset the market. If sales did take place, they should not change what we have told the market with our own Gold Agreement. It would have to be discussed with the IMF, in any case, but certainly the market should not be upset. That said, it is a theoretical assumption. At this stage, to my knowledge, no such decision has been taken. First of all, as I said today, reiterating what we said in real time – and it is very important for me to stress that – on 21 March, it is imperative that Member States, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union implement the revised framework in a rigorous and consistent manner conducive to prudent fiscal policies. I said today, on behalf of the Governing Council, in my introductory remarks, it is equally essential that the European Commission and the ECOFIN Council strictly enforce the new agreement on the implementation of the Pact, so as to restore the framework’s credibility. This is a strong message. We have already said that every institution has to be up to its responsibility, and this is truer than ever. As regards market sentiment, again, I already remarked that the market looks at situations and accumulates facts and evidence. At a certain point in time the market moves, so I would certainly not say that the market is incapable of discriminating between good and bad signatories. The market is certainly able to discriminate, and I think it would be a big mistake to say that this market discipline does not exist. And as far as we are concerned, we have our own framework, and it is not the intention of the Governing Council of the ECB to change our framework now. Again, since the setting-up of the euro and of the ECB we have had this two-pillar analysis. We are very clear on that, we have published articles on the subject. You know the facts and figures and you know our analysis because we are transparent. As I said, it is clear that there is more liquidity than is required for non-inflationary growth and we consider this one of the reasons why we have to be vigilant, why vigilance is of the essence. You also know that the monetary pillar is important for us because, in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. That is our belief. And the anchoring in particular of long-run inflationary expectations, even very long-run inflationary expectations, has been helped by the fact that we are one of the central banks in the world which has this monetary pillar. You know that when we reviewed our monetary policy concept to clarify it, we mentioned in particular the fact that the reference for M3 would be a medium-term reference and not a yearly reference, but we will certainly have to see exactly how things are going. For the present I summed up our sentiment by mentioning that we think there is more liquidity than is required for long-term non-inflationary growth. I am asked this question regularly. Of course, in our own perspective it is not pertinent. Mechanically, both growth and inflation are touched and there are a number of models that would give the impact. As you know, what we have to deliver is price stability, and by delivering price stability we also deliver the best monetary and financial environment we can for growth and job creation. There is no contradiction, so we will continue to do what is necessary to deliver price stability. What was necessary today was not to change rates. "
2005-03-03,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure to welcome you to this press conference. The Vice‑President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Prime Minister Juncker and Commissioner Almunia. On the whole, we continue to see no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. These interest rates are at historically low levels and are making an important contribution to the economic recovery. At the same time, upside risks to price stability over the medium term exist. These require continued vigilance on the part of the Governing Council. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, real GDP in the euro area grew at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, third-quarter real GDP growth was revised down to 0.2%. This overall outcome for the second half of last year was disappointing. However, the composition of demand growth in the fourth quarter also offered some positive signs with regard to the underlying trend. The strengthening of domestic demand and, in particular, consumption may point to the recovery in economic activity in the euro area regaining some momentum. There are a number of reasons why the weaker real GDP growth in the second half of 2004 could be a transitory phenomenon. On the external side, growth in the world economy remains strong, supporting euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment is expected to continue to benefit from very favourable financing conditions, robust earnings and greater business efficiency. Consumption growth should benefit from anticipated developments in real disposable income. Accordingly, we expect continued economic growth in 2005 and 2006. This assessment is also reflected in the new ECB staff projections, which will be published today. Euro area real GDP growth is projected by the ECB’s staff to be, on average, between 1.2% and 2.0% in 2005 and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2006. These projections are lower than those published in December 2004, reflecting the weaker economic developments in late 2004. Available forecasts from international and private sector organisations convey a broadly similar outlook. The picture emerging from the projections contains a number of risks. On the external side, high and volatile oil prices and persistent global imbalances pose downside risks to growth. As regards exchange rates, we confirm our position – expressed when the euro rose sharply – that such moves are unwelcome and undesirable for economic growth. On the domestic side, there are uncertainties surrounding the evolution of consumption, while the very favourable financing conditions and the recovery in corporate earnings could lead to higher investment growth than currently projected. Turning to consumer prices, annual HICP inflation declined quite substantially in January 2005, falling to 1.9% from 2.4% in December 2004. This was largely a result of base effects from developments in indirect taxes and administered prices in some countries. In February, according to Eurostat´s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.0%. In the coming months, annual inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around 2%. Looking further ahead, there is no evidence that stronger underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Over recent quarters, wage increases have remained moderate. In the context of moderate economic growth, this trend should continue. These views are also embodied in the ECB staff projections. Average annual HICP inflation is projected by the staff to lie between 1.6% and 2.2% in 2005 and between 1.0% and 2.2% in 2006. These projections are broadly unchanged from the Eurosystem staff projections published in December 2004 and consistent with forecasts recently released by international and private sector organisations. Several upside risks to these projections need to be taken into account, notably future oil price developments. Developments in indirect taxes and administered prices may also again surprise on the upside. Furthermore, continued vigilance is required regarding the potential risk of past price increases leading to second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. In this respect, developments in longer-term inflation expectations need to be monitored closely. Further insight into the outlook for price developments at medium to longer-term horizons is provided by the monetary analysis. The latest monetary data confirm the strengthening of M3 growth observed since mid-2004. This increasingly reflects the stimulative effect of the historically very low level of interest rates in the euro area. As a result of the persistently strong growth in M3 over the past few years, substantially more liquidity in the euro area exists than is needed to finance non-inflationary economic growth. This could pose risks to price stability over the medium term and warrants vigilance. The exceptionally low level of real interest rates is also further stimulating private sector demand for credit. Growth in loans to non-financial corporations has continued to pick up in recent months. Moreover, demand for loans for house purchase has continued to be robust, contributing to strong house price dynamics in some regions of the euro area. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained, while medium-term upside risks to price stability exist and will be monitored closely. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term. Turning to fiscal policies, the Governing Council notes that, while some progress with fiscal consolidation and the correction of excessive deficits is envisaged in euro area countries’ updated stability programmes, further consolidation in a number of countries is needed. In particular, several countries do not plan to pursue an appropriately ambitious adjustment path and are not targeting close-to-balance or in-surplus budgetary positions by the end of the programme horizon. In addition, in some cases, fiscal targets are based on rather favourable growth assumptions and on insufficiently specified measures. With respect to the Stability and Growth Pact, discussions now need to be brought to a convincing conclusion with an outcome that safeguards fiscal discipline. The credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved. This is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all Member States. In this regard, the Governing Council welcomes the decision by the ECOFIN Council, based on a recommendation by the European Commission, to move, for the first time, to the next procedural step in the excessive deficit procedure and to give notice, in accordance with Treaty Article 104(9), to Greece. The Governing Council also takes the view that the extension of the deadline, from 2005 to 2006, for correcting the excessive deficit pushes the room for interpretation of the rules and procedures to the limit. It is now indispensable for Greece to take effective action to correct its severe fiscal imbalances. As regards structural developments, the euro area has seen relatively low trend productivity growth since the mid-1990s. An analysis of the determinants of productivity shows that lower productivity growth in the euro area has been partly related to higher employment due to greater participation of lower-skilled labour. Sustained wage moderation and some progress in labour market reforms aimed at increasing labour market participation appear to have partially shifted production towards a more intensive use of labour. There are also indications that the slower pace of productivity growth observed in the euro area since the mid-1990s reflects an insufficient use of new productivity-enhancing technologies. While productivity growth has increased in sectors that produce information and communication technologies or provide related services, it has declined in many other areas of the economy. This points to structural rigidities in the euro area that prevent or hinder the fast and effective dissemination of new technologies and improved production processes across the economy. Against this background, structural reforms that stimulate innovation, investment and productivity, and promote the use of new productivity-enhancing technologies are crucial. Stimulating product market competition, facilitating restructuring and improving human capital through adequate educational systems and “on-the-job” training are likely to speed up productivity gains from the use of new technologies. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * I note that this is not at all what we discussed this morning. This is not to say that I will not respond to your question; I only note that we did not discuss it this morning. Our position has been made public. We gave advice on the proposed changes in the law of the central bank. We said very clearly that we were very much opposed to a first idea, which was to eliminate from the Monetary Council the two Vice-Governors. That had been said from the very beginning and it drove the government and the parliament to change the draft law and to maintain the two Vice-Governors as members of the Monetary Council. We also said in writing, at the moment of the change and the introduction of a number of new members, that we advised staggering the introduction of the new members in order to be fully in line with the spirit of independence of the central bank and not to modify in one shot a large part of the membership of the Monetary Council. That was our position. I have nothing to add. It is a written position that was taken by the Governing Council of the ECB. And it was transmitted to the government. Well, this is a very, very important question, and I will say that we are very pragmatic. We look at facts, figures and data. What we have observed, if I take private consumption growth in the euro area, and – again – depending on a very cautious checking of the figures, is that we had quite robust growth of private consumption at the very beginning of last year. In the first quarter we had +0.8%. Then in the second and third quarters we had a very low level of growth of private consumption, namely 0 and +0.1%. And then in the last quarter we saw a pick-up, which was not negligible, because we jumped to 0.5%. There are reasons to think that this is the sign that private consumption could in the future be more robust than we observed in the second and third quarters of last year. Again, I remain very cautious. In the Governing Council we look at facts and figures. We look at our staff projections, which are made under the responsibility of the staff. We are not “underwriting” these projections. We look at a number of other projections that are made by the international institutions and private sector institutions, and we make our judgement. So we will see what happens. But it is absolutely clear that private consumption and domestic demand in general play a very important role in the growth of the euro area. And if I may only add one element: we are there to deliver price stability. When we observe the level of private consumption over the past period of time we see that it is insufficiently dynamic. And it is a problem for the euro area. Part of this relative absence of dynamism comes from consumer confidence being lower than we would hope. A small part perhaps, or a bigger part – it has to be checked, it is very delicate – of this insufficient level of consumer confidence can come from the fear of inflation in the future. When you ask people all over Europe, they still have this idea that perhaps price stability will not be delivered. We are there to tell them: “We will deliver price stability. And if this fear is affecting your consumer attitude – change, be more positive. You should have more confidence. We are there to guarantee to you that we will protect your purchasing power”. Again, we will see what happens. We are very pragmatic and wait for facts and figures. But the profile I have just mentioned is clearly indicating that, despite the overall disappointing growth in the fourth quarter of last year, private consumption is more dynamic than in the previous quarters. A moment ago I mentioned the fact that we have observed very strong credit dynamics in some regions of the euro area, and we feel that part of these outstanding credits are financing the price increases. This is one of the reasons why we must remain vigilant. This message has also been conveyed by the various national central banks concerned, which are in very different situations. Germany is not in the same situation as other countries, for example Spain. We are in various universes and thus it is also the responsibility of both the surveillance authority of the banking sector and national central banks to communicate messages. At the level of the Governing Council, we have identified that such a phenomenon exists in some regions of the euro area. As I have already said, we do not feel that it is alarming at the level of the euro area as a whole, but we have identified it as a phenomenon that calls for vigilance. In reply to the first question, I will certainly repeat what I have said on a number of occasions, namely that, in a vast continental economy, it is not abnormal to observe different figures on growth, inflation or unit labour cost across different regions and countries. In all continental economies, including the United States, it is possible for some states to be booming while others have a much lower level of growth. My second observation, and I will not expand too much on this, is that, as you know, in the case of Germany, a correction is made for the number of working days, which perhaps plays an important role. I say this with great caution, but without that 0.6% correction, you would be in positive territory, and the differential with the average of the EMU would be very different. We will see whether this is an explanation quite soon when we receive the figures for the first quarter of this year, because they should offset the abnormal level of growth in the fourth quarter. But, again, I make the point, and it must be fully understood that, in a vast economy of 306 million fellow citizens, it is normal to observe some differences. In order to explain why Germany is still in a phase of lower growth, it is necessary to take into account the catching-up process in terms of cost competitiveness. This might explain why Germany, whilst making a lot of progress in its cost competitiveness position, is still registering unsatisfactory domestic demand. At the level of the Governing Council of the ECB, we look at the situation of the euro area as a whole, taking the full body of the euro area economy into account. Each economy is playing its role at its own level. We will continue to look at it from this angle as required by the Treaty. As you know, each national central bank governor does not defend a national position, but operates at the level of Monetary Union as a whole. In answer to your second question regarding growth in fixed capital investment, this element deserves to be underlined and you are right to ask the question. According to available figures, and we have to remain cautious and prudent, we have seen growth in capital investment which is not negligible for three quarters: 0.5% in the second quarter of 2004, 0.6% in the third and 0.6% in the fourth. It can be seen therefore that we are in positive territory and this element must be noted. We expect, but again we are cautious, that this phenomenon will continue and perhaps accelerate in line with what I have said and, in particular, with the earnings, improved earnings, and improved profitability of a number of private institutions in the private sector. On your first question: things have to be very clear – I am not an optimist and I am not a pessimist. I am, and I am speaking on behalf of the Governing Council as “porte-parole”, I am a realist. We have to be pragmatic: we have facts and we have figures. It is a little paradoxical to say that we are very optimistic when I have just explained that, in 2005, the understanding of our staff is that real GDP growth will be between 1.2% and 2%. You can call this what you like, but I would say that these are projections that are revised downwards. It is true – and this has to be taken into account – that these projections are explained to a large extent by the carry-over of the disappointing growth of the second half of last year, and – in particular – the fourth quarter of last year, to the full year of 2005. So, there is an arithmetic carry-over that may explain perhaps two-thirds of the disappointing outcome of the new projections in comparison with that of the December projections. So, let me say it again: we are neither optimists nor pessimists, we are realists. And we are pragmatic and keep as close to the facts and figures as possible. It is to the best of their understanding, that the staff of the ECB makes those projections. And, again, the projections are very much in line with what we are observing both from the private sector and from the public institutions. As to the extent that we ourselves have an influence on these growth projections, I would say that it lies in delivering, and continuing to deliver, the very low level of nominal and real interest rates that we are delivering thanks to our credibility and thanks to the fact that we are credible as regards inflation expectations. I will go back to that. And, as I have also said, we tell consumers directly that they can have confidence, and we trust that confidence is really of the essence in the euro area today. We are an anchor of confidence; we are a sanctuary of confidence. As regards your second question, we are looking very carefully at all indications we have of inflationary expectations. As you know, we have surveys – we have private surveys that are carried out totally independently from us, we have our own surveys and we have the inflationary expectations extracted from indexed bonds. All these indications are converging in that they tell us that we have to remain vigilant because we had observed a tendency towards increased inflation expectations in past years. And that was one of the reasons why we said that we have to be vigilant – one of the reasons, but not the only reason. I have to mention – but I don’t want to be too optimistic in this respect – that, since mid-2004, we have seen a tendency of these inflationary expectations decreasing a little bit, in particular on the basis of what we can extract from indexed bonds. But you know that behind all this stands a theory quite sophisticated, because you have the inflationary expectations themselves, and then you have risk premia for the possible inflation volatility, and also liquidity risk premia. But overall, if I make a synthesis, I would say that I am more satisfied with the observations we make today, including those derived from indexed bonds, than I was six months ago. But vigilance remains of the essence. I would say that we had a very profound discussion, weighing the situation, weighing the economic analysis very thoroughly, weighing also the monetary analysis which calls for vigilance because we have observed that there is more liquidity in the euro area economy than is required for non-inflationary growth. All things taken together, we all concluded that we currently have, with this decision to maintain rates as they are and to continue to be vigilant, exactly the right posture. It is clear I think, for the full body of observers, and from what we are all observing on the markets, that everybody knows that at a time we will have to increase rates. That is anticipated by all observers, by all market literature and by all market futures observations, and observers seem to me in line with the reality of our own posture. So it is clear that we are looking at what is happening and taking into account the facts and figures and data to the extent that they are available and reassessing the situation along the lines that I have just said. Divergencies between…? On the first point, I have already said what I think about what is observed in a vast continental economy with differences. I take for likely, I do not recall exactly, that it was a comment on the last observations of the last quarter of last year and there, again, we have to remain a little bit cautious on how to interpret what has been observed, in particular in Germany. I remain very cautious. We will see exactly what might happen. In a number of domains, I have the sentiment that since the creation of the euro the dispersion of some important indicators has not been increasing, for instance as regards inflation. If I take the overall constellation of observations, I do not see elements that would substantiate divergencies. So we have to be again cautious, look at the various data, know that it is normal to have and to observe differences. Of course we can be surprised and everybody was surprised by the figures that were produced in the last quarter of last year. Again, we will see exactly how to judge it. I said already that it will depend very much on the observations of the first quarter of this year. As regards Citigroup, I have nothing else to say. There are inquiries and we will see what the results of these inquiries are. I fully respect the procedures which have started in a number of countries in the euro area in particular. As regards the advances towards a single market – a real single market – for financial services, we are as you know very much in favour of advancing in that direction as far as possible. We trust that there is a source of additional growth in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole associated with a real single market in services in general and in financial services in particular. That being said, we are not calling for changes in the overall framework that exists today, and where the Treaty gives responsibility to national authorities, what we do is to call on those national authorities to engage in as close and intimate cooperation and coordination as possible. We trust that this is the appropriate way in the present circumstances to make progress. No, we did not. But I already said that. First of all, our position as regards the Stability and Growth Pact is very well known and I don’t want to repeat it here because it has already been done very clearly. We accept improvements in the preventive arm of the Pact and we are advising not to change the corrective arm of the Pact, to maintain the nominal anchor of the 3% and the integrity of the excessive deficit procedure. We will see exactly what goes on in the important meetings that Prime Minister Juncker is chairing and we will see the results of this discussion. But our position is very well known. Each institution has to take its responsibility. We take our responsibility. We said, what was our position, more than a year ago. The Commission has enormous responsibility and we consider the Commission as the guardian of the Treaty. It has enormous responsibility in this respect. The final decision belongs to the Council and we will see again what the Council is deciding and when the Council has taken a decision we will say exactly how we assess that decision. As regards the question – which is an important one – on figures, data and data collection and reliability of figures and data, we already said very clearly that we were strongly in favour of a system which would be more credible both at the level of Europe and at the level of the various countries concerned, all member countries of the European Union. We call for more independent institutions at the level of each country and we call at the level of Europe for, say, in the sphere of the Commission, an independent, strong institution having the capacity to control what is prepared at national level by investigations of files and going on the spot if necessary. There has been some reflection on this issue, both in the Commission and in the Council. We believe that it is extremely important not to engage in permanent battles on figures. We must have a referee which will be totally reliable and which could say “These are the figures”. What I see across the Atlantic is very much a system where there is no dispute on figures, but a dispute on the fundamentals, I mean on the policies themselves and on the decisions, but not on the figures themselves. No, we did not discuss that matter this morning. And I will not comment on the decision taken today by the Parliament in Rome. I have no particular comment on that. I will certainly say that the Stability and Growth Pact has to be respected. That is my comment. It is a good question of course, because it is absolutely clear that the price of oil is an important element, both at the level of the euro area and at the level of the global economy as a whole. It is also true that we have observed a level of volatility that has been considerable over time. We have some explanation for the tensions that are observed now, in particular the weather and the accumulation of additional consumption which is associated with what we observe in the weather. I only mention that in the staff projections, the assumption for the annual average oil price for 2005 was USD 44.7 per barrel and for 2006 USD 42.2. And of course these are what they had extracted, at the moment of the computation of the projections, from their observations at the time and from futures, because these assumptions are based on information enshrined in a futures market. I do not want to embark on arithmetic computation. There are risks if the price of oil is above what I just said. There we of course have a downside risk as regards growth, and this is something which is important to consider, i.e. that we are in a risk environment and of course there are also risks as regards headline inflation. Any increase in the price of oil has this immediate consequence on both areas. Let me add that I myself have signed the G7 communiqué where we call for a better functioning of the oil market, we call for much more transparency, we back the initiative to have a much better functioning of the oil market, and we call for responsibility in this domain, too, from all parties concerned. For a very simple reason, which is associated with the evolution of the euro and the dollar, we certainly will produce accounts that will incorporate an important element of unrealised losses, because it is the way that our own accounts are computed. We will produce the figures when we have gone through the exercise. I have no comment. On the first point, I have already said what I had to say. We are looking at the situation, we are incorporating new data and new figures and when it appears necessary to guarantee – which is our mandate, and which is the needle of our compass – price stability in the medium and long run, then, we will do what is necessary. As regards that second point, as you know, I will only say that we are looking at what is happening everywhere. Since the setting-up of the euro we had a neutral position as regards the international use of the euro. We did not encourage the international use of the euro; we did not discourage the international use of the euro. We considered that we had to be neutral and to let market participants, observers, savers, do what they would judge appropriate. We call in any case for an evolution that would be as smooth as possible. And it is the working assumption that we are making that we would observe a smooth evolution in the context of long-term, global growth, which would call for additional reserve instruments or additional monetary and financial instruments. Again, as I said, we are looking at the euro area as a whole. We are looking at the 306 million inhabitants of the euro area and we are not looking at any particular region as our focus of interest. Because questions have been asked on Germany and because figures on Germany have been raising some legitimate questions, let me reiterate what I said: on the occasion of the reunification we had an increase in a number of costs that was very well explained at that time by the buoyancy of that particular economy. You might also have the reverse phenomenon: The phenomenon where you are accumulating a very low level of unit labour cost and then after a long period of accumulation, of “over-competitiveness” you are losing this “over-competitiveness”. I here quoted Germany, but I could quote the Netherlands as offering an opposite example, over the last few years, where you had a period of great success as regards cost competitiveness, then buoyancy in the economy and then increasing unit labour costs that were eroding this very remarkable “over-competitiveness”. So, these are phenomena that are normal in a vast continental economy. It is clear, when you look at the unit labour costs that the situation of some economies, and it is true not only for Germany, has improved considerably in comparison with the average for the euro area. Situation today is much better than six years ago and you can see with the behaviour of German exports that it is paying off. Still, we are not observing, as you said, the spillover to domestic demand. We will see. Again, I am prudent myself. I do not want to embark on any particular projections, but it would be wrong to look at any particular country looking only at the liabilities associated with that country. There are also assets in the case of this particular country. There are both difficulties which are obvious and also elements which are perhaps more encouraging. In any case, we look at the full body of the euro area. It is our responsibility and we have to guarantee price stability to the area over time, which we do. "
2005-02-03,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure to welcome you to this press conference. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. All in all, the information which has become available since the last meeting of the Governing Council means that our assessment of price stability over the medium term is unchanged. While short-term HICP inflation rates remain subject to certain volatilities, particularly in relation to oil prices, there is no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their historically low levels. However, upside risks to price stability over the medium term remain. Continued vigilance is therefore of the essence with regard to those risks. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail. Turning first to the economic analysis, recent data on economic activity, as well as survey information, suggest ongoing moderate growth in the fourth quarter of 2004 and a broadly unchanged situation around the new year. Looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for economic growth to pick up and become more self-sustained in the course of the year. Global growth remains solid, providing a favourable environment for euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment is expected to continue to benefit from very favourable financing conditions, improved earnings and greater business efficiency. Moreover, consumption growth should develop in line with real disposable income growth. High and volatile oil prices and persistent global imbalances pose downside risks to growth. On the domestic side, reducing uncertainties associated with the extent and pace of fiscal and structural reforms would support consumption, as such uncertainties seem to be limiting private sector expectations of future real disposable income growth. As regards exchange rates, we confirm our position, expressed when the euro rose sharply, that such moves are unwelcome and undesirable for economic growth. Turning to consumer prices, annual HICP inflation stood at 2.4% in December, up from 2.2% in November. Data for January are not yet available, but there are indications of a decline from December’s inflation rate. Over the coming months, volatility in annual inflation rates is likely to persist, reflecting in particular oil price developments. Looking further ahead, on the basis of the information available so far, HICP inflation is expected to fall below 2% in the course of 2005, provided no further adverse shocks occur. At the current juncture, the evidence does not suggest that stronger underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of ongoing moderate economic growth and weak labour markets, this trend should continue in the future. However, several upside risks to price stability need to be taken into account. Concerns relate in particular to future oil price developments and, more generally, to the potential risk of second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. In addition, developments in indirect taxes and administered prices need to be monitored closely. Further insight into the outlook for price developments at medium to longer-term horizons is provided by the monetary analysis. The latest monetary data confirm the strengthening of M3 growth observed since mid-2004. This increasingly reflects the stimulative effect of the historically very low level of interest rates in the euro area. As a result of the persistently strong growth in M3 over the past few years, there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary economic growth. This could pose risks to price stability over the medium term and warrants vigilance. The very low level of interest rates is also fuelling private sector demand for credit. Growth in loans to non-financial corporations has picked up further in recent months. Moreover, demand for loans for house purchase has continued to be robust, contributing to strong house price dynamics in several euro area countries. The combination of ample liquidity and strong credit growth could, in some parts of the euro area, become a source of unsustainable price increases in property markets. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained. However, medium-term upside risks to price stability persist and need to be monitored closely. It is important that higher inflation in the short term does not become entrenched in long-term inflation expectations and wage and price-setting behaviour. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term. With regard to fiscal policies, a thorough assessment of the most recent updates of Member States’ stability programmes is under way. It is essential that Member States comply with their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact in the implementation of 2005 budgets and in the setting of medium-term objectives. Where relevant, this implies a correction of excessive deficits this year and determined progress towards budgetary positions which are close to balance or in surplus. Such measures should prevent a repeat of past outcomes, when insufficient adjustments were made. In light of the need to prepare for population ageing, fiscal strategies should also be part of a comprehensive reform strategy aimed at raising Europe’s growth potential. Discussions on the European fiscal framework now need to be brought to a convincing conclusion. With a view to fostering confidence, the Governing Council supports proposals that strengthen the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, which deals with the surveillance of budgetary positions. As regards the corrective arm of the Pact, the mechanisms in place must remain strong and credible in all respects. It would therefore be counterproductive to change the Regulations, dilute the 3% deficit limit or weaken the excessive deficit procedure. The fiscal framework enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in the Stability and Growth Pact is a cornerstone of Economic and Monetary Union and thus of central importance for the cohesion of Monetary Union itself. It is important to avoid any doubts about the effectiveness of the surveillance process and the soundness of the fiscal policies of the single currency area in the long run, as such doubts would ultimately lead to higher risk premia and higher real interest rates in the euro area. Regarding structural reforms, the ECOFIN Council has recently endorsed the Annual Report on Structural Reforms 2005, prepared by the Economic Policy Committee. The Governing Council fully supports the ECOFIN Council’s conclusion that “particular attention should be given to increasing employment rates, especially in the context of ageing populations, within the continuing need to increase growth by raising both employment and productivity.” To this end, we strongly support the Commission in its determination to promote the renewed Lisbon Strategy and we encourage national governments to show their determination in this regard by implementing structural reforms in Europe. Closing the existing implementation gap is essential in order to reap the benefits of reforms, in terms of both a higher growth potential in the medium term and improved consumer and business confidence in the short run. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * On the first point, we were exactly in the same state of mind as we were three weeks ago when I reported on the previous Governing Council meeting. After a very thorough examination of the situation, including – as I have said – both economic and monetary analyses, we concluded that our current rates were in line with this overall analysis and that we had to remain vigilant. And I insist on this element of vigilance – it is something that is extremely important. It is because everybody knows that we are vigilant that expectations, which we have to look at very carefully, are in line with our definition of price stability. Furthermore, I would say that the permanent sentiment in some circles that there is a constant arbitrage between price stability, on the one hand, and growth and job creation, on the other, is not at all what we experience and trust. On the contrary, we believe that by being vigilant and credible on price stability, we are preserving a financial environment that is, as you know, extremely favourable in our view. And I think that, arithmetically, we can demonstrate very convincingly that this financial environment is historically favourable for growth and job creation when you look at the yield curve applying to 306 million inhabitants in the euro area. Now, on China, I will only say that I am not in the habit of announcing in advance what will happen, or not happen, at the next G7 meeting under the Presidency of Gordon Brown in London. We, and you, will see then exactly what the meeting produces – I will be giving a press briefing together with Jean-Claude Juncker on the outcome. Until now, our position has been pretty well known, and you have read the previous G7 Communiqué. So, you have seen what we have signed and what message we have sent. On the first question, I would say the following: it is an observation that we have made at the ECB, which is also largely shared by our colleagues, of whom you have mentioned the Federal Reserve. I would say that it is perhaps also the G10’s sentiment that we are currently observing quite a low level of spreads and volatility in financial markets and, in some cases a certain under-pricing of some risks. It seems to me that the remark you were alluding to is part of this overall sentiment. It is nothing alarming that we perhaps have such a phenomenon. With regard to our own bond market, as I have said very frequently, the fact that we are credible in delivering price stability in line with our definition over time is part of the fact that our benchmark in the euro area with respect to euro-denominated long-term instruments is low because it incorporates a relatively low level of inflationary expectations. That does not prevent us from being vigilant. And, as you know, when we extract the inflationary expectations from index bonds, we see – depending on our analysis – that we are at levels which call for vigilance even if they allow very low long-term rates. On top of that, of course, you might have the spreads I have mentioned, the different assessments of risks that are generally quite low at a global level. I do not want to be alarmist, but I must say that we have, perhaps, a rather low appreciation of risks by markets at the European and global level. Your second question on house prices: we have said very clearly what our judgement was. In the euro area – and it is the euro area as a whole that we have to look at – we have signs that credit dynamism, might foster asset price increases in the real estate sector. And this calls for vigilance. We have already said that it calls for vigilance. I would say that, at the moment, at the level of the full body of the euro area, taking account of the full body of the euro area, we are not at a state of alarm. But there are risks that could materialise, and we have to be vigilant. On the first question regarding the inflation forecast, we have regular projections and we will tell you when we have the next quarterly projections. We have revised absolutely nothing at this stage. We have observed a high level of volatility. I mentioned the figures for the last month, and we expect the figures for this month to be lower, perhaps significantly lower. But we expect that there could again be ups and downs over the coming months. As you know, headline inflation depends arithmetically very much on shocks, in particular to the evolution of oil prices. If there are no new shocks, and with all other things being equal, we expect inflation to fall below 2% in the course of this year, which would bring it into line with our definition of price stability. I will not be more precise at the present moment. We should be conscious of the fact that there is volatility. We are reasoning in the medium term and our credibility is enshrined in the economic agents´ and market vision on a medium to long-term and even to very long-term basis. As regards the rumours, I never comment on rumours. If it is a quote, please tell me who said it. The ECB’s position is very clear – we are open to improvement in the preventive arm of the Pact. This has been our position for one year and we have said that very clearly. We think it is important. All the difficulties we have been observing stem from ignoring the fact that, as in the biblical reference during good times you had to put aside what was necessary to weather what would happen when you were in difficult times, and that is something which is very important. We are fully on board for the proposals made by the Commission. Any proposals that could emerge from the EU Council will certainly be examined very carefully by us, with the idea that we can improve things. As regards the corrective arm of the Pact, we have always thought it was a very important part of EMU (Economic and Monetary Union). The EMU has three letters: U stands for Union, that is clear. M means Monetary Union and E refers to Economic Union. And in Economic Union, the Stability and Growth Pact, and its corrective arm, is very important. You know the reasoning of the ECB. We do not have a federal government, we do not have a federal budget, but we have a single currency. Had we not had the Stability and Growth Pact, it could have been said that we were putting the cart before the horse, because we were very bold in introducing a single currency without having a federal budget. So we are very attached to that and we take it that it is something which is important. We are not responsible either for the proposal or for the final decision. Legally the Commission is responsible for the proposal and the Council is responsible for the final decision. They know what our position is and they know what our reasoning is. Each institution must assume its responsibility. We will see. On the first point, I will not elaborate more on what I have already said. On top of the real interest rates, which explain what you are observing in the market, you have the inflationary expectations, which give you the benchmark for nominal interest rates. Then you have all the spreads corresponding to the risk assessment depending on the quality of the various signatures. And it is there that you might have the under-pricing of risks I mentioned. I will not comment on the real interest rates, which have to be analysed at a global level and not only at the level of Europe or the US. We are very proud of the credibility of the Governing Council, the ECB, the Eurosystem and the euro in delivering price stability. But, as you know, we have to be vigilant. There is no time for complacency. We would certainly not say that we are in a credibility trap, that we are “too credible” and are delivering too low long-term market interest rates. We are very proud of this credibility: we consider it a decisive element for us, confirming that inflationary expectations of economic agents are in line both with price stability and through price stability with what is best for European growth and job creation. So, to have these low levels of medium and long-term market interest rates is a major contribution to European growth and job creation, which is associated with our credibility. On your second question on sustainable growth, we consider it our responsibility to deliver price stability. As I have already said, there is no contradiction between price stability and the best environment possible for growth and job creation. We have proved that arithmetically, in a very convincing fashion to the extent that you even say, we are delivering too low market interest rates! The only thing I would say is that a good, credible monetary policy is necessary for growth and job creation. It is not sufficient per se – if it were, we would not need a good fiscal policy, appropriate structural reforms, and an appropriate handling of costs in general in the economy. So we are one of the elements which is contributing to growth and job creation. We are absolutely convinced of that. But fortunately it is also the conviction of the Council, and it is certainly the intimate conviction of the new Commission – President Barroso and Commissioner Almunia are very, very clear on that – that structural reforms are of the essence. It is the focus of the new Commission, if I have understood correctly, to facilitate and permit the delivery of effective reforms. That is the way to increase Europe’s growth potential and to produce more sustainable growth and more job creation. It is not a “magic of a fancy concept”! We know that economies that have embarked on these reforms have experienced higher growth and job creation and the effective fight against unemployment. So, that is the analysis at present. We are very much in agreement on that – the problem is how to deliver efficiently. That is why we are very happy with the work done by Wim Kok: we think that his proposals were important and we are very attentive to what will be done now. But to be efficient in the delivery, you have to convince people: we are living in democracies and that is why communication is essential. The day when the people of Europe are convinced that reforms will really produce higher growth and job creation, we will certainly be much more efficient and effective in this reform programme. On bond trading: we in the ECB have an enormous stake in markets functioning fairly and correctly. This is absolutely decisive. Market economies are based on market assessments, market price-setting, which is, and must be, fair. If it is not fair, we would be far from the optimum in terms of economic functioning. And all what we are aiming for would not function correctly. So I make this point very strongly. Second, regulators and surveillance authorities are doing what they have to do in the precise case you mentioned and we will see what the result is of this investigation. I do not want to pre-empt the result in any respect, but the principles I have mentioned are very strong, which calls, of course, for as thorough as deep and strict as possible an examination of what has happened. As regards house prices, I do not want to repeat what I said: at the level of the whole euro area we are not at a state of alarm. In some parts of the euro area we see phenomena that are not, in our view, unsustainable and certainly are not welcome and warrant vigilance. …at the level of the euro area as a whole… No, before the bubble bursts, as you know pretty well. And that is the reason why I insist on continued vigilance, permanently. We also insist – although it wasn’t mentioned in the question – on the fact that the monetary analysis calls for vigilance, as I said, because we see dynamism of M3 and dynamism, by definition, of the counterparts of M3 which means that we – from that standpoint– can see that we could have an overhang of liquidity. And even if, in the short run, this does not necessarily materialise in inflation, in the long run we see– and this is the reason why we have a monetary analysis – that it can materialise in inflation. So I would say that we follow this evolution of the monetary aggregates with great care. We see phenomena that have to be monitored very closely. We could see that the explanation we had on the portfolio shifts and then the unwinding of portfolio shifts, which was a convincing element in understanding what was happening, does not seem now in our own analysis to be convincing in explaining the present dynamism of M3. So it really calls for vigilance. That is clear. That is not something that we have discussed recently. Again, we will be meeting the Chinese delegation in London this week. And I will certainly not mention anything in advance of our meeting other than say what we have already conveyed to the Chinese and they know exactly our sentiment on a possible better functioning of the global economy, if some moves were to be made. I will not say any more on that because, again, I will be more explicit in London later. "
2005-01-21,Trichet,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to the ECB. Today it is my pleasure to introduce an important new set of statistics for the euro area as single economic entity. These statistics provide a breakdown of euro area balance of payments transactions and international investment positions by counterpart country and area and are compiled by the ECB’s Directorate General Statistics. In recent years, major progress has been achieved in developing monetary, financial and balance of payments statistics for the euro area. This work, carried out in close cooperation with the Member States, has resulted in a full range of timely and high quality euro area statistics, which the ECB constantly monitors in performing its policy functions. Balance of payments statistics for the euro area have long been available at a monthly frequency, and will continue to be published every month. We will today present, for the first time, a geographical breakdown of the euro area balance of payments. From now on, this breakdown will become available at a quarterly frequency. In addition, we also present the geographical breakdown of the international investment position that will be available for end-years. Let me explain the rationale for this geographical breakdown of the balance of payments and international investment position statistics. The euro area is a major economy and is in fact the largest participant in many world markets. In turn, it is affected by a broad range of external developments, both financial and non-financial. Growing integration within the euro area has not reduced the need to analyse the global markets in which economic entities in the euro area are so active. For the ECB, it is crucial to have the best possible understanding of how external developments affect the euro area. Therefore, the ECB continually assesses the nature, magnitude and pass-through of external shocks. The new geographical breakdown – consisting of eleven important counterparts of the euro area – will provide a consistent framework in order to better understand how external links may affect the euro area economy, including: through external trade in goods and services, and through financial flows and positions vis-à-vis the rest of the world. In a nutshell, the geographical breakdown of the euro area b.o.p. that we will present today reveals the current importance of trade and capital flows with the United Kingdom, the United States and Switzerland. In the year from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2004, these three countries accounted for approximately 40% of euro area trade in goods and services and for most of its financial transactions. The importance of the United Kingdom, the United States and Switzerland is confirmed by the geographical breakdown of the international investment position at the end of 2003. I am convinced that the geographical breakdown of the quarterly euro area balance of payments and annual international investment position statistics will add new insights into the external economic relations of the euro area. Thank you very much for your attention. Now, the Director General Statistics, Mr. Steven Keuning, will present more detailed features and the first results of the new statistics. "
2005-01-20,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, The Governing Council’s decision on the winning design concluded the international urban planning and architectural design competition for the ECB’s new premises. This means that a major step towards building a new, permanent home for the ECB here in Frankfurt has been completed. Over the past three years, we have made considerable efforts in preparing this competition and seeing it through to its successful conclusion last week. This process has involved not only our own experts, but also external consultants. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them for the quality of their work and their genuine commitment to this project. We also very much appreciated the good working relations with the City of Frankfurt authorities, which were of great assistance, and we look forward to continuing this excellent cooperation. We would also like to thank again all the architects who took part in the competition and submitted such a great variety of design proposals. We are especially grateful to the three prize-winning architectural offices which participated in the revision phase of the competition. Over the past 11 months, they have gone into substantial depth to elaborate the details of their design proposals. The high quality and professionalism of the work done in the revision phase was very much appreciated by the Governing Council. The Governing Council’s decision on the design of the ECB’s premises was reached after extensive discussion and careful evaluation of the prize-winning designs. As a public institution, we are committed to performing our tasks effectively and to using our financial resources prudently. Therefore, it was essential to have a thorough and comprehensive assessment – even if that prolonged the process somewhat – so as to make the right decision on a matter of such symbolic and financial importance. Let me now explain briefly the main reasons why the Governing Council chose COOP HIMMELB(L)AU’s design. I am delighted that the architect, Prof. Wolf Prix, and his colleagues, Mr Dreibholz and Mr Halm, have joined us for this press briefing today. The Governing Council judged the revised design concept of COOP HIMMELB(L)AU not only to be superior from an overall aesthetic and urban planning perspective, but also to be the one that best met the functional and technical requirements specified by the ECB. It was felt that this expressive, dynamic and appealing design would serve as a unique landmark, and result in the ECB’s new premises having a strong identity. In the Governing Council’s view, this design concept had features that reflected the ECB’s values – in particular, unity and transparency – and translated them into architectural language. Furthermore, the way in which the three elements of the design – the high-rise building of a twisted shape, the “groundscraper” and the Grossmarkthalle – formed a harmonious and well-proportioned ensemble was assessed very positively. We also considered that the integration of the Grossmarkthalle into this ensemble was addressed in an excellent way, while at the same time respecting the fundamental appearance of this historic building. The design concept also met, in principle, the ECB’s functional and spatial requirements. The Governing Council appreciated especially the good connection of the different functional areas and the excellent workplace quality, guaranteeing natural light for all members of staff. Using the atrium as a large communicative zone within the two tower buildings was also welcomed. The Governing Council noted that all requirements for the energy concept had basically been fulfilled and that the design complied with the relevant regulations in the fields of building and environmental law. So where do we go from here? The Governing Council decided that the next step would be an “optimisation” phase in which the selected architect would again review his design on the basis of further guidance from the ECB. We will reassess the ECB’s functional and spatial requirements and, on that basis, seek to further optimise the design with the aim of reducing costs. With regard to the cost, the estimates available at present, taking into account the optimisation potential, suggest that the construction costs will be about €500 million. The total investment costs, however, will be higher, since they include additional elements, such as the cost of purchasing the Grossmarkthalle site, planning fees and other infrastructural costs. Some of these additional cost items are related to the construction costs, while others depend on further deliberation and specification. More precise information on the cost aspects of the project will be provided at the end of the detailed planning phase. I should like to emphasise that we will continue to work closely with the City of Frankfurt authorities in the coming phases of the project, especially in view of the urban development plan that will be adopted by Frankfurt’s City Council. I am delighted that the Governing Council’s decision has been very well received; not only by representatives of the City of Frankfurt, but also by the local and international media. Let me conclude by stressing that the Governing Council was very pleased indeed with the way the competition ran, with the quality of the designs and with the outcome of the competition. Of course, more challenges and many further decisions lie ahead. The successful completion of the competition is, however, an important milestone on the way towards building a new home for our institution. I am convinced that the winning design chosen by the Governing Council will become not only a Frankfurt landmark, but also a symbol of a united Europe and its single currency, the euro. I would now like to invite Prof. Prix to present his design proposal. "
2005-01-20,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, We have invited you today for the presentation of the chosen design proposal in the international urban planning and architectural design competition for the New ECB Premises. In our introductory remarks we would like to do the following: First, to briefly recall the main steps that have led to the outcome of the competition. Second, to present the chosen design proposal in some detail. And third, to explain what happens next. Afterwards, we will be happy to answer further questions, as will the chosen architect when it comes to technical questions on the design proposal. Last Thursday, on 13 January 2005, “the Governing Council chose the design for the ECB’s new premises out of the 3 revised design proposals of the 3 prize winners of the international urban planning and architectural design competition. After extensive discussion and a careful evaluation, the Governing Council concluded that the revised design concept of Coop Himmelb(l)au best meets the functional and technical requirements specified by the ECB, and has features that reflect the ECB’s values and transforms them into architectural language.” [Quotation of the Press Release] On 13 February 2004 an international jury consisting of architects, Eurosystem representatives and a representative of the City of Frankfurt chose three winning designs in accordance with the following criteria, as laid down in the Competition Rules out of the 12 design concepts submitted in the Second Phase of the competition: Overall town-planning, architecture and landscape; Compliance with the main features of the functional and spatial programme, including modularity; Feasible approach to an energy/environmental concept and compliance with the main features of the ECB’s technical requirements; Compliance with the relevant rules, in particular in the field of building law and environmental law. The first prize was awarded to Coop Himmelb(l)au, Vienna; the second prize to ASP Schweger Assoziierte, Berlin; and the third prize to 54f architekten+ingenieure, Darmstadt, in cooperation with T.R. Hamzah & Yeang, Selangor. On 18 March 2004, the ECB’s Governing Council decided to invite all three prize winners to revise their design concepts in accordance with the Jury’s recommendations and the ECB’s requirements. The purpose of this Revision Phase was to remedy the remaining functional and technical deficiencies of the concepts. The final decision on the design concept to be implemented was made on the basis of the revised concepts and the criteria laid down in the Competition Rules. In the Revision Phase each of the three teams has gone into depth of research and development, reaching a level of design for a new premises which would be suitable for the ECB and could be realistically constructed. I would like to thank them for their work and have great respect for what they have created. Each design proposal is unique in its own way. As we will, of course, only build one design, we, my colleagues from the Governing Council and myself, had then the difficult/challenging task to choose one of the revised design proposals. We had then great pleasure to confirm the Jury’s proposal and to announce Coop Himmelb(l)au as the winning architect of the international urban planning and architectural design competition for the new ECB premises. I would like to ask now Mr. Papademos, as he was also the Chairperson of the international jury of the competition, to present the main elements of the Governing Council decision for the chosen design of Coop Himmelb(l)au.. "
2005-01-13,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I would like to welcome you to the first press conference of 2005 and extend our best wishes to you for the new year. Let me also take this opportunity to say that all our thoughts are with the victims of the recent flood disaster and with their families in the countries concerned and around the world. I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr Juncker, in his joint capacity as President of the ECOFIN Council and of the Eurogroup, and Mr Barroso, President of the European Commission. Commissioner Almunia was also invited to attend. While short-term inflationary pressures persist, they have recently diminished somewhat, mainly due to the decline in oil prices from the peaks seen in October. At the same time, there is currently no significant evidence that underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their historically low levels. However, upside risks to price stability over the medium term remain, and continued vigilance is of the essence with regard to those risks. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. Eurostat yesterday released a new estimate for real GDP growth in the third quarter. At 0.3% quarter on quarter, it confirmed the previous estimate. While information on the fourth quarter is still incomplete, the latest macroeconomic data and survey evidence, although mixed, appear to suggest ongoing moderate growth. Looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for economic growth to proceed. On the external side, global growth is expected to remain robust. The strength of global demand should help to sustain euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should be supported by the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area, improved corporate earnings and greater business efficiency as firms continue to restructure. Moreover, private consumption is likely to evolve in line with the development of real disposable income. Consumption would also be supported if uncertainties surrounding the extent and pace of fiscal consolidation and structural reform in the euro area were reduced. Downside risks to the economic outlook stemming from oil price developments have diminished somewhat over recent weeks. As regards exchange rates, we confirm our position, expressed when the euro rose sharply, that such moves are unwelcome and undesirable for economic growth. Turning to prices, annual HICP inflation was 2.3% in December according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, up from 2.2% in November. Annual HICP inflation rates of above 2% are likely to persist over the coming months, notwithstanding the recent oil price decline. Looking further ahead, however, the available information indicates that, barring further adverse shocks, HICP inflation will fall below 2% in the course of 2005. Moreover, the latest indicators do not suggest that underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Wage increases remain contained, against the background of ongoing moderate economic growth and weak labour markets. In the context of what is a broadly favourable outlook for price developments over the medium term, upside risks to price stability need to be taken into account. Given past oil price rises, there is a continued need to avoid second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. Responsibility on the part of social partners remains very important. Moreover, developments in indirect taxes and administered prices require close monitoring. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm our previous assessment. Monetary and credit growth strengthened in the second half of 2004, largely as a consequence of the prevailing low level of interest rates. Given the strength of monetary dynamics over the past few years, there remains significantly more liquidity in the euro area than is required to finance non-inflationary growth. Overall, the monetary analysis points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. At the same time, the combination of high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could in some countries become a source of unsustainable price increases in property markets. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures are contained but upside risks to price stability over the medium term need to be monitored closely. In this context, it is crucial that there is no spillover from current short-term developments in consumer price inflation to long-term inflation expectations. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term. With regard to both fiscal policies and structural reforms, the governments and institutions of the European Union will have to confront many important challenges in the course of 2005. Foremost among these challenges is the need to strengthen public finances by correcting excessive deficits swiftly and returning to a path of vigorous fiscal consolidation. Moreover, throughout the European Union there is a need to address the considerable challenges that population ageing poses to existing pension and social security systems. There is also a need to now bring the ongoing discussions surrounding the European fiscal framework to a convincing conclusion which builds trust and confidence. The existing fiscal framework enshrined in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact is a cornerstone of Economic and Monetary Union and thus of central importance for anchoring expectations of fiscal discipline. The Governing Council is convinced that improvements in the implementation of the Pact are possible. At the same time, it reiterates its position that it would be counterproductive to change the Regulations, dilute the 3% deficit limit or weaken the excessive deficit procedure. Turning to structural policies, the forthcoming mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda provides an opportunity to give renewed impetus to structural reform in the euro area, as called for by the recently published Kok Report. We strongly support a reform agenda which focuses on raising employment growth, fostering investment and stimulating innovation and productivity. Progress in this direction will not only enhance the underlying growth potential of the euro area economy over the medium term, but will also help to bolster consumer and business confidence over a shorter horizon. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * We had a very thorough discussion and the President of the European Union, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, were witness to our exchange of views. I remind you that every fortnight we invite the President of the ECOFIN, the Eurogroup and the representative of the Commission to participate, as the Treaty calls for. And I would stress that there is, in this respect, a very close relationship between the ECB and the pertinent institutions of Europe. And the conclusion was, all things taken into account and balancing all arguments considered pertinent, and after a very thorough economic analysis and monetary analysis, that we consider that the rates today are exactly the kind of rates which are fitting with our mandate, and also that we have to continue to be vigilant. Because vigilance is of the essence if we want our mandate to be fulfilled. And I do not want to repeat what I have said from time to time, but one has to understand that, by expressing our vigilance, we are permitting inflationary expectations to be anchored on a two-year, five-year, ten-year, twenty-year, thirty-year basis. I could see that for myself only a few days ago: one of the member countries of the Eurosystem issued securities on a thirty-two-year basis – more than thirty years – at an extraordinarily low level of interest rates. And that is possible only if markets, if investors, if savers, believe in the capacity of the ECB to deliver a very low level of inflation over thirty-two years. If they did not believe in this capacity, they would elevate the level of their inflationary expectations and we would immediately have medium- and long-term market interest rates that would be higher, or much higher, or much, much higher. And if you want to know what it could be like, you only have to look at what existed before the euro was set up. So, again, it is very important that we continue to be vigilant. And we are vigilant. I know, of course, that what is very important for you is to note a subtle difference. I would say that, as regards inflation, we have, as everybody has, observed a certain attenuation of the impact of the price of oil. And that, of course, has an impact on immediate and short-term inflationary observations. In that sense, yes, the environment has changed a little bit. But what counts, really, is the medium-term perspective. And I would say that in the medium term we have exactly the same kind of analysis as we had before. So, the present changes, or the immediate future changes a little bit, but it is not really very pertinent. Because we are permanently reasoning in the medium term. And when I say medium term, I also mean the long term and even the very long term. As regards growth: of course, we have observed that some indications, particularly those coming from the Commission, were a little bit more favourable. We will see. We consider that we still have mixed signals. Some are going in the direction of more robust growth. Others are going in the other direction. And I would say, to sum up, that we are very much in the same universe of moderate ongoing growth. That is really the best summing-up I can deliver. Since the very beginning, we have followed, with extremely close attention, inflation expectations, which anchor our entire monetary policy. Not only are they a permanent measure of our success and challenges, but they are also incorporated in market interest rates. If inflation expectations on a ten-year basis are going up, it augments, all else being equal, market rates. If they are well maintained, in good order, in line with our definition of price stability, then we have lower market interest rates. From time to time, we are judged to be too “obsessed” by inflation expectations. And there is a sentiment from time to time that this attention is producing higher interest rates. It is exactly the contrary. If we are credible in this permanent search for appropriately low inflation expectations, we deliver low market interest rates. And then we are creating the very favourable financial environment which is part of our own contribution to growth and job creation in Europe on a sustainable basis. So I insist very much on that. That being said, of course they fluctuate, and our successive analyses are very much based on what we are observing on the side of inflation expectations. And you are right on one thing: if we extract the break-even inflation rate from indexed bonds, we see that there has been a tendency for them to rise a little. The most recent evolution has been a little in the other direction. So, after having attained a certain peak they are now going downwards. And we believe that the strong expression of vigilance has played a role in calming down something that was rising slightly. Now, this is technically quite complex, because you can interpret this break-even as incorporating inflation expectations and risk premia on future inflation. So we measure real inflation expectations not only by the break-even inflation rate extracted from index-linked bonds but also using surveys and consensus estimates of future inflation. The present level, i.e. the last information we had, is 1.9-2%. Again, this calls for vigilance. But it is also the representation of our own long-term credibility. So, again, we will maintain credibility and do what is necessary to maintain credibility. As regards Secretary Snow, I said a few days ago that I had seen the declaration he made. What was important was that he had said he wanted to do things to sustain the strength of the dollar. Among them was to go to Congress and work on the deficit. And that was really something which I praised because I believe that it was something important. I have nothing to add to what I have already said. I believe that when things are said that are, in my opinion, important and excellent, why not mention them? Each of us has our own mandate and responsibility, and I have to tell you that all the G7 meetings I have participated in, including when I was not President of the ECB but rather observing what was being discussed, have proved to be very efficient in terms of interaction between the various participants, including the President of the European Union and the President of the ECB – my predecessor as well as myself. So, I would certainly consider that, a priori, there is nothing to be said on this interaction. As regards what the United States might or might not ask, we will see when we participate in the meeting, but again, I do not want to anticipate in any respect what we will do, or what the British Presidency will do, I will only say that the present global consensus – and it has been expressed several times before now – is that we all have homework to do. There is a consensus in the international community that structural reforms are of the essence in the euro area, and in Europe as a whole, because it is the appropriate way to elevate the growth potential, and our contribution to global growth would be to elevate the growth potential. There is also a consensus that the same can be said as regards Japan, and that the savings issue in the United States is a very important question for them – exactly the equivalent of structural reforms as far as we are concerned. I can also tell you that this consensus is shared to a very large extent, as far as I understand, by colleagues in the G10 and in the Global Economy Meeting when we meet in Basel. Papademos: I should first say that the strengthening of the euro against the dollar has adversely affected the financial result of the ECB in the year 2004. And the reason is very simple: the bulk of our foreign exchange reserves are in dollars and when the euro appreciates relative to the dollar, the value in euro of the assets denominated in dollars declines, and we therefore have unrealised losses. As you know, we follow a prudent accounting approach so that unrealised losses are recorded and reported as realised losses. So, it is correct that in the year 2004 the ECB will record a loss. However, we would like to communicate the magnitude when we have the final figures and when the time comes for approving the financial results of the ECB. Papademos: That is when the financial results will be approved by the Governing Council and they will be reported. Papademos: The composition of our foreign reserves we do not disclose. The financial results will be disclosed when the time comes and when we have the full decision on the accounts. I said that we considered the present level as being exactly the kind of level which was in line with our analysis. On the first point I would say, that we are very eager ourselves to have the best possible exchange of views between the Eurogroup and the ECB. I already said on the occasion of this press conference that we were inviting ourselves, every fortnight, the President of the Eurogroup and the Commission to participate in our own deliberations, which, of course, is a very good way to understand how we are reasoning ourselves. The Vice-President and I have the privilege of being invited every month by the Eurogroup to reciprocate and to have a full knowledge and understanding of the way the Eurogroup is reasoning. We all have our responsibility, but it is important that we understand each other as well as possible with mutual respect and mutual respect for independence, which goes without saying. I have to say that we are in full agreement, and I am personally in full agreement, with Jean-Claude Juncker on all that, and today was precisely an illustration of this accord. Our will has never been to have a Eurogroup which is as weak as possible – it is exactly the contrary. We consider that by sharing the same currency we are sharing a common destiny. There are a number of points which are of extreme importance: fiscal policies, structural reforms of all natures, which are in the hands of the Ministers of Finance and not in our own realm. All this is very important for an appropriate functioning of Monetary Union, and I remind you that the kind of union we have in the constituency of the 12 we call Economic and Monetary Union: EMU. On the second point you made: I mentioned that at 3.15 p.m. we will issue a press communiqué which will say that we took a decision this morning as regards the architectural choice for the future headquarters of the ECB. So at the end of this press conference it will be made public and then in the middle of next week we will have a special press briefing, the Vice-President and I, to explain in detail how we will proceed from now on and all the details which you would like to obtain about the future course of action. Papademos: So, not only did we discuss it but we took a decision .After a very careful evaluation of the three prize-winning design concepts from the international competition, the Governing Council reached the conclusion that the design proposed by COOP HIMMELB(L)AU is the one that best fulfils the selection criteria, particularly the functional and technical requirements specified by the ECB, and also reflects quite well the ECB’s values. You will find more details in the press release about our assessment concerning this design, and, as the President mentioned, in the middle of next week we will have a press conference dedicated to the presentation of the decision regarding the final design. On the second point, there has been a clear consensus amongst the international community at the last G7 meetings on the fact that there is a need for emerging Asia to move in the direction of a progressive and orderly appreciation of some currencies. That has already been communicated at the global level several times. I could mention at least three G7 communiqués on that. On the other questions, I will not make any economy-by-economy qualifications. We look at the whole euro area and it is at that level that we note certain phenomena. At this stage our monetary analysis suggests strongly that we have a high level of liquidity, higher than would be necessary for the appropriate financing of growth in Europe. We are reasoning in the medium term in this respect, not in the short term, and it is part of the risks that we have clearly identified. Of course, this liquidity has a counterpart. Part of the counterpart is precisely credit to the economy and, as part of that; we see a dynamism of credit to real estate, which is undoubtedly substantial. This is not the case everywhere because, again, we have the addition of economies that are not, from that standpoint, in the same position. As you know well, what you observe in Germany in the real estate market is not what you might observe in other countries such as Spain or anywhere else in Europe. So that is a question that we have to follow carefully and without undue alarm, but it is part of the risks that we are identifying. As far as the currencies are concerned, I have nothing to add. I will not comment on figures that are produced on a monthly basis. But we all agree that one of the risks at the global level in the economy is the constellation of imbalances. That’s absolutely clear. You have everything you need as regards the exchange rates. Not only did I say what our qualifications were in terms of our own exchange rate as regards the US dollar, but you also have the explanations I gave on emerging Asia. So I stick to what I said. No, not at all. I have to say that, as you know, I am the “porte-parole” of the Governing Council. So, it was not in the Introductory Statement, as we had considered that it was better for me to tell you directly, on the occasion of the press conference, what the position of the Governing Council was. But what I say here is as the “porte-parole” of the Governing Council. So do not draw conclusions from your observation between December and January. I would prefer the Bundesbank to communicate directly and, to my knowledge, they have done that. As regards the Eurosystem and myself as President of the ECB, I would say that we have an accord which gives options for a number of signatories to sell gold. Of course, it has been made public, so you know that there is an accord. You know who the signatories are: a number of central banks of the Eurosystem, the ECB itself and also other central banks which are not part of the Eurosystem, including those of Switzerland and Sweden. Together, we signalled to the market that we would perhaps sell gold under a certain ceiling over a period of five years. We can, of course, within the framework of this accord, where we have internal arrangements, have one participant deciding not to use his option, in which case there is, of course, the possibility for the option to be utilised by others. But, to my knowledge, the Bundesbank has communicated on that. This will not change the overall option for sales of gold by the Bundesbank over the full period. So it is much more the possibility for arranging the timing. It is not for me but for Axel Weber to explain and I am, in any case, only quoting what he said to give you an overall understanding. The ECB itself is also participating in this overall agreement. I note that the market has, thanks to this accord a full understanding of the possible interaction between the central banks and the gold market, as far as the signatories are concerned. So this accord is important. As you know, it started more than five years ago and we continue to have a very transparent, visible and predictable way of dealing with these gold sales. "
