Date,President,Text
14/12/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Let me first report that the Governing Council decided to reconfirm the existing reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4 1/2% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the available evidence continues to support the assumptions underlying the initial derivation of the reference value in December 1998 (and its confirmation in December 1999), namely those for trend potential output growth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity in the euro area. With regard to the assessment of trend potential output growth, there is still no decisive evidence that measurable and lasting increases in productivity growth in the euro area would warrant a significant upward revision in the assumption for trend potential growth. This notwithstanding, the uncertainties surrounding estimates of the medium-term development of potential output growth in the euro area have become skewed to the upside. Against this background, the Governing Council will carefully monitor further evidence with regard to an acceleration of productivity growth in the euro area. The Governing Council also wishes to emphasise that potential output growth could be strengthened by further structural reforms in the labour and goods markets. Naturally, the ECB's monetary policy will take such changes appropriately into account. The ECB will issue a press release today to provide some background information on the review of the reference value carried out by the Governing Council. The Governing Council also conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. It decided to leave the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem unchanged at 4.75%. The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were also kept unchanged at 5.75% and 3.75% respectively. Starting with the first pillar, it is fair to say that M3 growth rates have shown signs of moderation over the past few months. However, taking into account the protracted upward deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4 1/2% and the still robust growth of credit to the private sector, caution continues to be warranted with regard to the upside risks to price stability stemming from the monetary side. As for key indicators related to the second pillar, the assessment is currently complicated by increased uncertainty. In the first place, this applies to tendencies in the world economy. With regard to the evolution of real GDP growth currently foreseeable for the euro area, the underlying dynamism of growth continues to prevail, although subject to some moderation. Developments in euro area bond markets, characterised by a decline in bond yields in November and December, broadly confirm this assessment of growth. In foreign exchange markets, also reflecting the current outlook for global growth patterns, the euro has appreciated against the currencies of the euro area's most important trading partners. The Governing Council considers this development to be a step in the right direction. Turning to consumer price developments, recent developments have continued to reflect, above all, developments in oil prices, but also previous developments in the euro exchange rate. Over the medium term, the upward pressures from energy prices are expected to disappear gradually, while HICP rates of inflation will increasingly depend on domestic forces. On balance, the Governing Council judges the risks to price stability still to be on the upside. The Governing Council will continue to counteract any risks to price stability in the medium term by responding in a timely manner. At the same time, it does stress the importance of all economic actors responding in an appropriate manner to the current oil price-led increase in consumer price inflation. In particular, social partners can rely on the commitment of monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term and they should continue along the path of wage moderation observed in recent years. In the same vein, fiscal authorities should control expenditure growth, as it could otherwise fuel upward pressures on prices. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to inform you about other issues discussed by the Governing Council. First of all, I should like to provide you with information on several issues relating to the euro banknotes and coins. First, pursuant to the Treaty (Article 106 (2)), the ECB has the exclusive right to approve the volume of coins issued by the euro area Member States. To this end, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Decision on the volume of coin issuance in 2001. This Decision, which also covers Greece for the first time, will soon be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Second, in order to raise citizens' awareness and to prepare them for the cash changeover at the beginning of 2002, the Governing Council agreed to organise a series of conferences on euro changeover issues in the course of 2001. These conferences will bring together the key parties involved in the euro cash changeover process, both at the national and at the European level, with a view to focusing on the cash changeover preparations. This action should also be seen against the background of the Conclusions of the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 to 9 December 2000. Third, the Governing Council decided that tests on the euro banknotes will be carried out in all euro area countries in 2001. These tests will offer companies an opportunity to check and fine-tune their cash and/or vending machines and sensors with regard to their being able to recognise and accept euro banknotes. They will be organised by the euro area national central banks; the Bank of England will also be invited to participate. The ECB will monitor the test scenario in order to ensure a consistent approach and will act as the contact point for companies registered in a country without a test centre. Fourth, further to the ECB's press release of 3 August 2000, when the decisions of the Governing Council regarding the euro area financial modalities for the 2002 cash changeover were announced, the Governing Council agreed on general principles for the so-called frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro banknotes outside the euro area as from 1 December 2001. Today's decision, which complements the principles agreed with regard to the frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro banknotes inside the euro area, has to be seen as a contribution to ensuring a smooth cash changeover in 2002. You will find further information relating to this decision in a separate press release to be issued this afternoon. With regard to TARGET, the Governing Council decided to establish a long-term calendar of TARGET operating days to be applied from 2002 onwards. The establishment of such a common long-term calendar was deemed necessary in order to reduce uncertainties for financial markets. In addition to Saturdays and Sundays, TARGET as a whole, including both domestic and cross-border transactions, will be closed for a total of six days in the calendar year. You will find further information relating to this decision in a separate press release to be issued this afternoon. The Governing Council also adopted several legal acts related to the field of accounting, which will be published shortly in the Official Journal of the European Communities.These acts relate to the legal framework for accounting and reporting within the ESCB, the annual accounts of the ECB and the allocation of monetary income of the euro area national central banks and losses of the ECB for the financial years 1999 to 2001. Let me also draw your attention to some of the decisions taken by the Governing Council at its previous two meetings. First, the ECB budget for 2001 has been approved. It includes a staff increase of 7%. By the end of 2001, the ECB will therefore have approximately 1,100 staff members. Second, in connection with the Bank of Greece's entry into the Eurosystem, the Governing Council adopted several legal instruments on the transfer of foreign reserves from the Bank of Greece to the ECB, the crediting to the Bank of Greece of a corresponding claim on the ECB and the contribution to the capital, reserves and provisions of the ECB by the Bank of Greece. These legal acts will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities shortly. Amendments to several other legal instruments were also adopted. Third, I should like to mention that, following the very positive reaction to last year's ""Helsinki Seminar"", the ECB is organising a second seminar with high-ranking officials from the central banks of the EU accession countries. This seminar will be held tomorrow in Vienna, in co-operation with the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, and will focus in particular on issues related to the price dynamics in accession countries, the role of the central banks in managing the accession process and the co-operation between the Eurosystem and the accession countries' central banks. The ""Vienna Seminar"" will be followed by a press conference at 4 p.m. tomorrow. Finally, I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that its next meeting, which is scheduled for 4 January 2001, will be held by means of a teleconference. The press conference originally planned for that day has thus been cancelled. The next press conference will take place on 1 February 2001. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, how would you comment on the statement Alan Greenspan made on 6 December. He said, ""Do not worry - we may reduce interest rates if there is too quick a slowdown in the United States."" What do you think? Will this have as an impact on Euroland. And the next question is: how do you feel about the exchange rate of the euro? Are you happy with the way things have gone? Usually, I think that a central banker should not comment on speeches of other central bankers, so I will refrain from commenting on the speech presented by my colleague, Greenspan, last week. The development of the exchange rate of the euro is - I must say - completely in line with what we have said and expressed all along as our opinion, namely that the euro had a strong potential to appreciate from the levels it had reached in earlier months, so that has not been a surprise, but rather an expectation that has come true. Question (translation): A follow-up on that, Mr. President: could you tell us the extent to which Alan Greenspan's statement has indirectly had a soothing effect on Euroland. It was not discussed in the Governing Council, so I that have nothing to report in this respect. But I think that the speech made by Mr. Greenspan has itself contributed to the tendency of the euro exchange rate to appreciate, which had already set in some time earlier. So, in that way, it has had a positive impact. Question (translation): Two questions, if I may: my colleague introduced the question. The first question, Mr. President, is that I would like to have your view of the results of the European Council in Nice. Do you think that the results of the European Council in Nice, which are not great, will have an effect on the euro exchange rate? And the second question, as we are now coming up to the second anniversary of the single currency: how do you feel about the year that the euro has experienced? Has it been a good year or has it been an annus horibilis for the euro? First of all, if the European Council meeting in Nice were to affect the exchange rate, it would already have had that effect because exchange rates happen to react very quickly to events, be they political or economic in nature, and - as you will have seen - the euro exchange rate has hardly been touched by the outcome of the European Council meeting, which - I think - is a good thing in itself. If I reflect on the past year, I am always inclined to reflect on the period since the birth of the euro, i.e. a period of almost two years. On that basis, I am filled with a feeling of satisfaction in many areas, namely the smooth introduction of the euro, the rapid development of a single money market in the euro area, the rapid developments - which are still going on - in the capital markets in the euro area, and I could go on and on with phenomena like that. I will not deny that, in the past, I have been somewhat dissatisfied or - how should I say that in English - disappointed with the actual development of the exchange rate of the euro. That feeling of dissatisfaction has disappeared now that the euro seems to have turned the corner. Well, I can only report on what the Governing Council discussed today. This, of course, also included the risks of a hard landing and the outlook for the world economy as a whole. And, as I had said in my introductory statement, all available evidence is pointing towards the fact that a period of robust economic growth, be it at a somewhat slower pace than we have seen in recent months, still lies ahead of us in what we regard as the foreseeable future. We therefore anticipate that a growth rate in the order of 3% per year will be maintained in the euro area for at least the next two years. Well, on your first question, I cannot see any reason to change that judgement. On the second question, I cannot quantify how serious the upside risks are, but there are always risks to price stability - in one direction or another. The main thing I said was that the risks, as we see them, are on the upside rather than on the downside, but I cannot quantify the degree. Could you expand a little on your second question? To answer the last question first. It is indeed a historic and a both very satisfying and gratifying moment for a member of the European Union to be able to comply with all the criteria relating to entry to the euro area, to participation in Monetary Union. And I think we have to say that Greece has made great and commendable efforts in order to reach this stage. It shows the extent to which entry into Monetary Union and, therefore, complying with the Maastricht criteria have acted and are still acting as a catalyst for moves towards more sound public finance policies, an environment of low inflation and appropriate monetary policies. So that is all gratifying and sound. As to your first question ... It still has a lot of further work to do. But I would also like to mention that Greece is going through a period which we all having to go through - a period in which oil price increases are working their way through in the domestic economy. And, in the case of Greece, the oil dependency or energy dependency of the economy is significantly higher than in other areas or in the rest of the euro area. So, it still has to undertake great efforts to make the position it had reached upon entry a sustainable one. Well, what countries outside the spectrum cannot do is use monetary policy to fight inflation. They will therefore have to revert to all other areas of policy and behaviour. And this is not only a call for government action. It is also a call for social partners to try to get back in line with the average for the euro area and, ultimately, to get back in line with the goal that monetary policy has set for itself, namely keeping inflation below 2%. I also wanted to ask about the following: there does seem to be some slowdown at least in the reversal of capital flows between the United States and the euro zone and, since you were trumpeting this some time ago, I wonder if you could comment on this issue. I do not see that much of a difference, if at all, between the degree of activism of the Federal Reserve system, on the one hand, and the European Central Bank, on the other. It is true that we have a well-defined primary target, a primary mandate in our policy, namely maintaining price stability, whereas the mandate of the Federal Reserve is much broader in scope. It includes the promotion of economic growth, an equitable income, even balance of payments behaviour, as well as, of course, inflation. But as different as the circumstances of their respective economies may be, I cannot really see any difference in the actual behaviour of the two central banks. So, this is also something the markets should understand. As regards the second question, could you, Christian, say something on this ...? Noyer: ... on this slowdown in capital flows or on capital flows in general? We do not have any new figures compared with what we had discussed before. I apologise for this, but I do not think we have released much in the meantime. So, this is probably a question which should be raised at a later occasion, once we have new evidence. They will see that we will publish some macroeconomic indicators in terms of ranges of projected developments. The public will have to understand, and we will make it very clear, that these projections are based on certain hypotheses concerning, in particular, interest rates and exchange rates, which will supposedly remain unchanged in the future. Thus, the projections will be based on hypotheses which, to be honest, will in all likelihood not turn out to be true in the future. Thus, the projections, to put it differently, are likely to move out of line with real developments in the future. But, as a central bank we will never, as some other institutions do, create expectations or formulate certain hypotheses about underlying variables which are crucial to us, like the exchange rate or short-term interest rates. We will never make them into a self-fulfilling prophecy. So we have to base these expectations on these hypotheses in public. And the media and academia will have to understand that, and I think they will. If everyone understands them in this way, they will make our deliberations even more transparent by showing on what hypotheses our deliberations - those of the Governing Council are what I am now talking about - are basically well-founded. No, but what the Intergovernmental Conference has done is take a decision to propose a change to Article 10 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, which relates to the voting procedures. This would consist of including in the Treaty an enabling clause. This clause would make it possible in the future, if the number of members of the Eurosystem - not of the European Union, but of the Eurosystem - were to increase significantly, to change the procedures of the decision-making bodies of the Eurosystem. This change could then be enacted by a decision of the EU Council in the composition of the Heads of State or Government on a recommendation of the Governing Council of the ECB, which would, in that case, have to be made unanimously and after having consulted the European Commission and the European Parliament or on the recommendation of the European Commission after having consulted the European Central Bank and the European Parliament. So, it is an enabling clause which is to be included in the Treaty. The enabling clause itself has - as do all other decisions - to be ratified by all parliaments of the EU Member States and this is expected to take some time - I believe that it is expected that the ratification procedure may take up to two years. Well, in both cases the governors of the central banks concerned have left of their own free will and fully independently. One has taken on a position in London, the other is taking up a position in Basel. So, I do not see that as being of any relevance to the accession process as such. Question (translation): A question, Mr. President: if in Euroland you see a potential growth of between 2% and 2.5%, and if you assume that economic growth is over 3% this year and will probably be over 3% next year, and perhaps in 2002, the simple question is: are there going to be bottlenecks? Are there going to be capacity bottlenecks and do you think that this may have a negative impact on price stability? Then, with regard to the enlargement process, a second question: President Welteke from the Deutsche Bundesbank has said over and over again that it is a question of real convergence, not nominal convergence of the Maastricht criteria, but real convergence in terms of the maturity of an economy, legislation, and privatisation. Is this a concern for the ECB, if these countries join the EU and then, soon after, the euro area? First, we do not see the likely or expected development of the real economy for the foreseeable future as in itself being a danger to price stability, as we define it. Alongside the expectation of a continuation of what we call a ""robust pace of economic growth"", we also expect the level of inflation to come down gradually over the medium term to within the limits we have set ourselves, which define price stability, namely to under 2%. However, we have to cope with the, in principle, temporary effect of the huge increase in oil prices which is permeating the economies. As far as the convergence process for the accession countries is concerned, when the time comes, i.e. after having become a member of the European Union, the accession countries will have to demonstrate that they are converging in the direction of the average performance of the euro area and we will assess this when the time comes, at the time when they actually want or desire to participate in Monetary Union as well, which is more than just the European Union. We will write a convergence report at that time, but not at this point. But, that convergence report will then be based on - or will use - the same criteria as those that are currently being used and that have been used for all present and future members of Monetary Union. We discussed this extensively. Of course we discuss the question ""Has the new economy arrived in Europe?"" - because that is basically your question - extensively almost every two weeks . We sometimes feel that it has arrived here and there, but, taking a euro area perspective for the euro area as a whole, on all the available evidence we cannot as yet conclude that a decisive shift in the trend rate of productivity growth is discernible. We hope it will come, we may even think it will come, but it has not come yet. Noyer: I hope I said - and if I did not, I will correct myself - that it was for the years 1999-2001, so that covers the period in which we do not have euro banknotes, only national banknotes. In the Governing Council we did take decisions on a number of small issues for tiny amounts where we had already pooled the monetary income, but they were not material. And you will see when the text is published that it is just to be in line with our principle of transparency and clarity about the rules we have adopted that we progressively publish in all official Community languages the previous decisions when they are consolidated, but there is nothing new. I mean, the issue you may have in mind has not yet been decided. Noyer: I can only say that the Governing Council needs to take a decision in order to implement one of several articles of the Statute concerning the issuance of the banknotes and the precise features of income distribution or redistribution, whether there will be any need - in the judgement of the Governing Council - for smoothing and, if so, how the features of this smoothing will be based on provisions contained in the Statute and the Treaty. Such decisions have to be taken before the end of next year, i.e. before the issuance of euro banknotes. For issues other than banknotes, the decision was already taken earlier and will be published shortly in a consolidated version, but this is not material, as I have said. I cannot say anything more for the moment. The Governing Council will take decisions in good time before the end of next year. That is all. Last question first. The discussions on finding a solution to the overbidding phenomenon, if we were to return to the fixed-rate tender procedure, are still going on. So we are still looking, but it seems that it would be feasible to at least largely overcome that problem, if it were to arise again, with the available solutions. The publication of projections, which will take place for the first time next week, will in itself simply enhance the transparency of, and therefore the insight that the outside world has into, the internal deliberations of the ECB. It will make our decision-making process more readily understandable and that, I think, is a great added value. "
02/11/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. It decided to leave the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem unchanged at 4.75%. The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were also kept unchanged at 5.75% and 3.75% respectively. Starting with the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, the three-month average of annual M3 growth stood at 5.4% in the period from July to September 2000, unchanged from the three-month period ending in August 2000. While remaining above the reference value of 4 1/2%, M3 growth, reflecting the increases in ECB interest rates since November 1999, has shown signs of moderation over recent months. A further factor to be taken into account is the fact that the growth rate of credit to the private sector increased to 10.8% in September. However, this was influenced by the financing of payments for UMTS licences. The growth rate of total MFI credit to euro area residents remained broadly unchanged in that month. Turning to the second pillar, one issue under consideration was the likely further development in world economic activity and particularly real GDP growth in the euro area. Overall, the outlook for growth of the world economy remains favourable. In particular, as far as the decline in real GDP growth in the United States in the third quarter of 2000 is concerned, this may be seen as the first sign of an orderly slowdown towards more sustainable levels, in line with the projections currently available. More generally, the extended period of rising and high oil prices has increased the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of recent growth trends. However, by contrast with previous periods of strong and prolonged increases in oil prices, the world economy is less dependent on oil today and inflationary pressures are still being contained. This should help to avoid any sustained negative effect on confidence, and thereby ensure that the impact of high oil prices on growth remains moderate over the medium term. Very much the same line of argument applies to the euro area. Euro area real GDP has been growing at a high rate for four consecutive quarters, including the second quarter of 2000. Some monthly indicators which extend into, or cover, the third quarter of this year point to a possible moderation in growth rates. In particular, the pace of growth in industrial production appears to have declined somewhat and some survey data have also indicated that there has been a certain degree of moderation. However, survey data remain at high levels and should be underpinned further by positive factors such as high employment growth. There is thus good reason to remain confident that strong growth will be sustained in the euro area. This picture is broadly supported by bond yields in the euro area. These have changed little over recent weeks. They continue to be compatible with market expectations of strong economic growth in the euro area in the medium term and with developments in consumer price inflation, which are in line with the ECB's definition of price stability. We trust that this assessment will also increasingly be reflected in exchange rates. These have clearly lost touch with economic fundamentals and this is posing risks to the world economy. For the euro area in particular the continued undervaluation of the euro vis-à-vis other major currencies is putting upward pressure on import prices. We shall, therefore, monitor exchange rate developments closely. As regards developments in consumer prices, no additional euro area-wide data on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) have become available since our last meeting. In September 2000 inflation rose to 2.8%, mainly as a result of higher energy prices. As I mentioned earlier, inflation rates may remain above 2% for longer than was expected just a few months ago, owing to unexpected developments in energy prices and the past decline in the euro. In order to maintain price stability over the medium term it is important that economic agents accurately perceive the nature of current price developments. In particular, it needs to be recognised that current upward pressures can be successfully overcome if economic agents see them for what they are - namely, one-off or temporary price increases resulting from external factors - and act accordingly. These factors must not give rise to second-round effects. If oil prices do not rise further, as the markets expect, the effects of past oil price increases will gradually drop out of the annual inflation rate. At the current juncture two main considerations should guide expectations regarding the outlook for the euro area economy. First, the Governing Council is committed to maintaining price stability in the medium term. It will continue to assess thoroughly the outlook for price stability in the euro area. Monetary policy will not accommodate inflationary tendencies in the euro area and in this way will make its best contribution to sustainable growth. Second, euro area countries are now in a much better position to withstand the adverse effects of a sharp oil price increase than they were in the 1970s. The Governing Council remains optimistic with regard to the economic outlook for the euro area. This positive outlook needs to be underpinned by responsible fiscal policy-making and by social partners reacting appropriately to the increase in oil prices. It is crucial that any loosening in fiscal policy be avoided. Similarly, continued wage moderation is important in order both to contribute to further decreases in the level of unemployment and to maintain a favourable outlook for price stability. It will be equally important for structural reform to be intensified further in order to allow current high growth rates of real GDP and employment to be sustained into 2001 and beyond, without generating inflationary pressure. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to inform you about two further issues decided by the Governing Council today. I should like to inform you that, in the course of next week, the ECB will release an update of the so-called Balance of Payments Book. This annual publication documents the statistical methodologies applied in EU Member States for the compilation of balance of payments statistics and, as such, improves the transparency of the compilation of euro area statistics. In addition to updated individual country chapters, this version includes two new chapters on the compilation and methodological standards for the euro area balance of payments and international investment position. The Book will be published on the ECB's website and hard copies will be available at the ECB. The Governing Council has today also adopted an ECB Regulation establishing transitional provisions for the integration of Greek credit institutions into the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system, as a consequence of the introduction of the euro in Greece as from 1 January 2001. We are now at your disposal for questions. Very little, I am afraid. I am aware of this fact. There has even been the tendency on some days for the EONIA to look as though it would fall below the minimum bid rate, but it did not happen. But we are of the opinion that, despite the series of interest rate increases which we have executed since November 1999, the liquidity situation, the overall liquidity situation in the euro area, can still be regarded as ample. The developments of the euro exchange rate over the last two weeks have - may I call it -been gratifying and have somewhat - but not yet totally, of course - corrected the strong undervaluation of the euro, as we believe. There are, as there should be, more normal growth rates in the United States. That means that the extraordinary growth rates which we have seen in the United States for a prolonged period of time and which we and other authorities did not regard as being sustainable in the very long term are coming down from annualised rates of 5 1/2% or even close to 6% per quarter in the direction of lower rates for what seems - to me - to be a normal and to be expected - may I call it - soft landing in the United States, which is in the interest of the entire world. It is too early to judge. Well, originally, about three to four months ago, we thought it would only take perhaps two to four months for the higher oil prices and the weak performance of the euro to peter out and gradually disappear from the figures. Now that we have had still further and sustained increases in oil prices and a prolonged or protracted period of a relatively weak euro, which is not in line with the fundamentals, we have come to the conclusion that it may take somewhat longer than the two to four months I mentioned earlier before price inflation comes back to levels at which we would want them to be. Well, our decision of today indicates that we still think that the monetary stance we took on 5 October is still appropriate for the current circumstances. Well, we have always been convinced that the euro will play an increasingly international role over time, but it may be a slow process. I am not commenting on the decision of any individual country. Nonetheless, the fact that this is happening illustrates that we may have been right in our expectations. I shall take no questions on interventions. Concerning second-round effects: We are seeing here and there in the euro area a tendency - a commendable tendency I would say - over the past few years towards moderate wage contracts. These moderate wage developments, which have been greatly conducive to the recovery in employment growth, are coming under tension and pressure here and there. No, I have not changed this policy. I shall tell you when there have been interventions. Well, the recent movements in the exchange rate of the euro do not bear witness to a further loss of confidence. What I have said in relation to the availability of what you call ""real cash"", which I would call ""banknotes and coins in circulation"", is that in the perception of the general public the fact that the euro already exists today, and has existed since 1 January 1999, is not sufficiently appreciated, because they do not have what you call the ""real money"" in their hands and pockets yet. I personally wish that we already had them. But it simply cannot be. We are still working hard on the possibility of publishing forecasts in the future. We have devoted a lot of discussions, both inside the ECB as such and in the Governing Council, to that subject. What format they will have, what the timing will be, what the coverage will be and, especially, what meaning they will have for the policy-making of the Governing Council, as such, are still very much under consideration. In addition, we do realise that we will have a lot of explaining, or even education, to do, as and when forecasts are published. Well, if anything has changed, maybe it is the experience of working together with the Eurogroup, that is the 11 - now already 12 - Ministers of Finance, of engaging in a very constructive dialogue about all our policies, both monetary as well as economic and financial policies, once a month. It has developed, and still is developing, in the direction of a truly constructive dialogue. So, although in the beginning I may have been a bit sceptical about the significance of such a dialogue, I must say I increasingly appreciate it as a golden opportunity both to hear and to tell our, may I call them our political counterparts, what we think of them and what they think of us. Seriously undervalued means relatively seriously undervalued. And with regard to how seriously the outcome of the US elections will affect the foreign exchange markets, I have heard from market participants so far - and I do not have any better sources than that - that they expect the effects - whatever the outcome will be - to be limited. And I believe that they are right, as markets almost always are. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, a question about the first pillar of your monetary policy strategy: at 5 1/2%, M3 growth is now closer to the reference value of 4 1/2% as a result of the interest rate hikes. Your statement in this respect sounds ""very moderate"". Now, does that mean that your money supply goals have been achieved or do you think that the reference value for next year should be set higher? I did not say ""very moderate"". What I did say was that it ""has shown signs of moderation over recent months"". That is only one thing. But the monthly, or the three-monthly M3 figures still remain significantly above the reference value, which we have set at 4 1/2%. So we will continue to monitor it very closely. But they are signalling - let me call it - no further deviation from the reference value, but rather some movement in the direction of the reference value. Question (translation): Two questions on the euro. Mr. Fabius said that the euro was undervalued by at least 20%. Do you share his view on that? And could you tell us why there have not been any interventions over the past few days? Quite a number of market operators were expecting interventions over the past few days. I am not inclined to put a precise figure on the degree of undervaluation of the euro. I know that there are many figures circulating on the markets - from Mr. Fabius, from the IMF, from many organisations. I prefer to abstain from playing a role in that discussion. I simply share the feeling that the euro is still seriously undervalued. And, on interventions, I can only repeat what I said earlier: I will not take questions on interventions. We have explained throughout that the undervaluation of the euro is to a very large extent due to the significant growth differentials between the United States and Europe. Now that that differential may be declining, there is every reason to believe that that undervaluation may, over time, also be gradually corrected. On the basis of all the information that we have, we are continuing to look forward to a robust rate of growth in Europe, both in 2000 and in 2001, and hopefully beyond - robust meaning a rate of growth at or in excess of 3% per year. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, over the past year you have always said how astonished you are that the euro is undervalued in relation to economic fundamentals and you have constantly raised interest rates in the Governing Council. You have almost closed the interest rate differential vis-à-vis the United States. My question is: can it be that there is something wrong with the Maastricht Treaty and the ECB? Is there something that is missing here? Or is there something clearer that the President could say? I don't think so. We have consistently said that the euro is undervalued. We share that judgement with all other authorities, at least in the G7 context, and a resumption or a continuation of the economic growth performance of the euro area will, over time, correct that undervaluation by itself. That is our strong belief. I do not see a deficiency in the ""Maastricht Treaty"". The Maastricht Treaty is unequivocally clear about what the mandate is for the European Central Bank, that is, that the primary objective is to maintain price stability. And the exchange rate as such could only have an impact on that mandate if, over time, the exchange rate itself were to be one of the factors undermining our efforts to maintain price stability. But that is all. "
19/10/2000,Duisenberg,"With a Transcript of the questions and answers Ladies and gentlemen, Today, the Governing Council met for the second time outside Frankfurt. Therefore, let me first of all thank our host, Governor Trichet, for inviting us to meet in Paris and for the generous hospitality offered to us. Our meeting was also attended by the President of the EU Council, Mr. Fabius, and European Commissioner Solbes. As usual, we conducted our regular examination of recent monetary, financial and economic developments and their implications for a monetary policy aiming to maintain price stability in the medium term. Following this review, the Governing Council decided to leave the ECB interest rates unchanged. Moreover, we exchanged views on achievements so far and the challenges ahead. Let me briefly report on developments since the last meeting of the Governing Council before turning to our more general assessment. As regards the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, no new data on monetary developments have become available since 5 October. Turning to the second pillar, oil prices and exchange rates remained two important factors under examination. Before coming down somewhat, oil prices had surged again as markets were concerned about the impact of political tensions in the Middle East. Meanwhile, real GDP growth over the four quarters up to mid-2000 has proved to have been very strong. As mentioned at our last meeting, some uncertainty about short-term growth dynamics stems from oil price developments, as is reflected in survey or confidence data. While these indicators have weakened somewhat in recent months, overall they remain at high levels and underlying forces for continued robust growth remain favourable. This is also reflected in little changed bond market developments. As foreseen at the time of the Governing Council meeting two weeks ago, energy price developments have had a strong impact on inflation rates; in September the HICP rate ofinflation rose further to 2.8%, compared with 2.3% in August and 2.4% in July. This development did not come as a surprise and was already taken into account in our considerations on monetary policy action on 5 October. Overall, latest developments underpin the message we stressed on 5 October, namely that monetary policy continuously needs to ensure that expectations remain firmly anchored in the maintenance of price stability, despite current inflation rates. In addition to commenting on more recent developments, I should like to take the opportunity offered by this special meeting to make a few remarks on where we stand almost two full years after the start of Monetary Union and where we see the main challenges. First, the process of monetary policy-making and its implementation has functioned efficiently. Our policy intentions to maintain price stability in the medium term are increasingly well understood by the general public. Second, the euro area economy impressively overcame the negative mood prevailing in early 1999 and has recovered to a state of affairs not seen for more than a decade. Not only has real GDP grown by more than 3 1/2% over the past four quarters, but employment has also increased and unemployment has decreased considerably. Clearly, the external value of the euro stands in sharp contrast with this very positive picture. The undervaluation of the euro is giving cause for concern that it might have adverse implications for the world economy, including the risk to price stability in the euro area that it entails. Adhering to its mandate and following its forward-looking strategy, however, the Governing Council will ensure that price stability can be maintained over the medium term. The confidence of investors in the internal stability of the euro and the positive outlook for euro area growth are contributing to the attractiveness of investing in the euro area and will support a stronger external value of the euro. Looking forward, there are indeed challenges to be taken up by means of appropriate and determined action, but there are good reasons for remaining confident. Monetary policy will ensure that risks stemming from import price developments will not translate into more permanent inflationary tendencies, thereby also helping to preserve steady GDP and employment growth in the medium term. Governments have increasingly come to recognise the benefits of sound public finances and adequate policies over the long term so as not to overburden future generations. However, continued determination is required. While overall budget positions have improved significantly, this has been helped considerably by the relatively low level of interest rates and the strong upturn in growth. These favourable conditions should be used to intensify the process of fiscal consolidation. Governments should demonstrate their commitment to structural budget consolidation by accompanying the forthcoming tax reforms with spending restraint. This would ensure the full benefits of such reforms. Governments have also acted in the field of product markets in order to make them more competitive to the benefit of consumers. A favourable impact on prices, growth and employment of opening up sectors to competition has become clear with regard to the telecommunications and energy sectors. The challenge is now to further reduce the level of regulation so as to stimulate activities in other sectors of the economy, too. Governments and social partners have started initiatives to enable labour markets to function more efficiently. The remarkable performance in employment growth in the past few years also reflects an increasing proportion in part-time employment and points to some improvements in labour market flexibility. Further improvements in labour markets can be supported from many sides. The social partners will play a key role by adhering further to a path of moderate wage increases, in line with price stability, and taking into account both productivity developments and the need to reduce the level of unemployment further. The benefits of such behaviour have already been seen. Moreover, there is a broad consensus that the larger part of the still high level of unemployment is of a structural nature; this challenge needs to be addressed continuously by policies which remove structural rigidities from the labour markets and which diminish adverse incentives provided by tax, benefit and pension systems. Ongoing structural reform will be particularly important with regard to the changing character of jobs in an economy which needs to be open to rapid advances in new technologies and globalisation. The Governing Council feels that the first 22 months of Monetary Union have been very successful. It is determined to continue addressing the challenges related to monetary policy and is confident that other policy areas will play their part in the overall policy framework of the Community and the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions. Laissez-moi vous dire combien je suis heureux et fier que la Banque de France ait été la seconde banque centrale après la Banque d'Espagne à accueillir le Conseil des gouverneurs de la Banque centrale européenne et son président en notre sein. Nous venons de tenir cette réunion du Conseil des gouverneurs et je voudrais vous dire que nous avons le sentiment, mes collègues et moi-même, et je crois parler au nom de mes collègues qui se sont réunis ce matin ici à la Banque de France, nous sommes très, très fiers d'appartenir à l'équipe monétaire de l'Europe. Nous sommes une équipe qui comprend le président de l'équipe, Wim Duisenberg, président de la Banque centrale européenne, et président de l'Eurosystème, et l'Eurosystème c'est l'équipe, c'est la Banque centrale européenne et les onze banques centrales nationales, et demain les douze banques centrales nationales. Nous formons une équipe très unie, chaleureusement unie avec le sentiment d'une responsabilité importante, chaleureusement unie derrière notre président Wim Duisenberg. Donc, Wim, je voudrais te remercier une nouvelle fois d'avoir, au nom de nous tous, accepté cette invitation, te dire combien nous sommes fiers et heureux, d'avoir pu être les hôtes de cette réunion et combien nous souhaitons t'écouter maintenant puisque tu viens de présider nos travaux. Merci. I do realise that some of my recent remarks - and you are referring to that interview, in particular - gave rise to critical comments and they certainly gave rise to a lot of advice. I have drawn my conclusions and I accept the advice and that is: I am not going to answer any questions related to that recent interview and, insofar as interventions are concerned, any questions related to interventions. I will confirm our well-known policy which is that intervention is a tool available to central banks to be used if and when appropriate. I shall stick to my statement. I am not going to comment further on either that interview or the interventions. I have no comments on it, because I do not know the reasoning behind it. The answer is ""yes"". The answer is ""no"". There was not. Trichet: Maybe I could just say that the team that we make up, namely the monetary team of seventeen that met under the chairmanship of Wim this morning, is profoundly and unanimously united behind its President. The impact of the recent further surge in energy prices leads us to the conclusion that, if they were not to come down quickly, the period during which the actual inflation rates would be over the 2% limit, below which we want them to remain, will be somewhat longer than we anticipated earlier. In addition, the terms-of-trade effects implied in the rise of energy prices will have some impact on dampening the growth prospects for the euro area. But they do not - given the much smaller energy dependence of the euro area economy compared with 20 or 30 years ago - have the impact that would make us change the assessment that we are experiencing, and we are looking forward to experiencing, a period of robust economic growth. Of course, I cannot comment either on the level that there is or that we expect. I can only say that we strongly believe - and in our discussions this morning it was repeated and repeated, and in my introductory statement and also I repeated it - that the euro is undervalued, that there is a misalignment in the currency markets and that there will come a moment at which that will be corrected. As far as the instruments that we have available are concerned, they are the same instruments that we have always had available, namely interest rate policy and interventions. We have them all available, as we have repeated and repeated. I cannot comment on the latter question. On the first question, I would like to correct you. We have indeed seen some decline of both industrial confidence and consumer confidence in the last two months, but not yet in spending. On the contrary, industrial production figures continue to be robust, very high. And we do believe that the recent hesitation in the confidence figures, if I may call it that, has to a very large extent been influenced by the incidents, the blockades on the occasion of the rise in energy prices that many European countries have experienced. We do believe this to be a temporary shock to confidence, the significance of which should not be overstated. We have various indications to confirm the view that we will be in for a prolonged period of robust economic growth. On the first question, I cannot give any further comments. I am still saying we are at cruising altitude. Given our assessments of all the forecasts we have available, both internally and from the outside world - from many, many institutions, both national and international - we do expect economic growth to continue at a rate above 3%, both in this year and next year, perhaps even in the year thereafter. What we would consider before the end of the year would depend on the new data that will become available before the end of the year. Still, we do believe that the monetary policy stance that we chose to adopt on 5 October is the appropriate one in the present circumstances. I would say that, on balance, our monetary policy is still accommodative and is thus no hindrance whatsoever for a further growth of GDP and employment. I have seen much speculation about that, also in recent days. I can assure you that the Governing Council is working hard on the preparation of the decision whether and, if so, how and when to publish the forecasts. I think the central bank - and this includes its President and its entire leadership, the Governing Council - should, in the end, be judged on the extent to which they have fulfilled their mandate, that is to preserve price stability over the medium term. We have - I believe, in one of our last Monthly Bulletin - given an account of structural measures that have been taken here and there and everywhere. They are still not enough, but we do not want to create the impression either that nothing is being done. In many countries, more in some than in others, structural measures to improve the functioning of the labour market are certainly being taken and, in a few countries, this has clearly led to very positive effects in terms of bringing unemployment down and, at the same time, pushing growth up. So, I believe we are being listened to, and governments and social partners can be certain that we will not be silent for a long time. Question (translation): Two years have to elapse before the end of your mandate, President Duisenberg. If the euro were to fall below 80 euro cents per US dollar, could you envisage drawing the conclusion , that your mandate has been a failure, has not satisfied the markets and would you pass your mandate on to someone else, possibly to Mr. Trichet? On that question, as I promised on 31 December 1998, I will give no further comments. I would like to restate that everything I have read over the past couple of days has led me to heed some of the advice which I got from all over the world, through the media, and to draw my own conclusions. And my conclusion, I have made very clear, is that no further comment is to be expected from me either on that interview, or on interventions. I only wish to re-state that interventions remain a tool in our tool-box. And we will fully inform you of their use once they have been used. I cannot tell you about everything Mr. Fabius said. But the subject was not raised. Yes, we believe that it is in the interests of a central bank to be transparent, especially for a new institution, and thereby to be as predictable as possible. As I also said at our last press conference, it cannot, by definition, always be excluded that there may sometimes be surprises. But our policy is not a policy of surprises. Our policy is a policy of a ""steady hand"" working its way towards maintaining our target and that is a rate of inflation of below 2%. Well, let me say that I do not know of any institution, be it the IMF, the OECD, a private economic research institution or a central bank, that has not come to the judgement that the euro, at its current rate, is seriously undervalued. And that means that it is misaligned. We can witness this fact in various indicators, such as the relative balance of payments positions, as well as the capital flows which have taken place. But then I would like to point out, as I said in my introductory statement, that there are first indications that the capital outflows we have witnessed over the past year and a half have already been reversed. First, we are not at all envisaging a revision of our stated definition of price stability, namely the rate of increase in prices of below 2%. The implication of that definition is that we have to explain why there could be external shocks which temporarily bring the actual rate of inflation to above this figure, which can at times happen and which we have always foreseen could happen. But, having had such an external shock and, I must confess, earlier than foreseen, we do regard this as a temporary phenomenon. We are fully confident that - also taking into account what you said about core inflation, although this is not a concept that we gladly use, but the truth is that, while core inflation has been creeping up somewhat over recent months, it is still well within the range of below 2% and that, in the circumstances, we are having a temporary transgression of actual inflation rates, which may last, as I have said, for some time yet - our monetary policy stance, as we chose it to be on 5 October, after seven successive increases in interest rates, is the appropriate one for the present circumstances. Duisenberg:I cannot quantify the number of months. We think that it will take rather longer than we anticipated only three months ago, when we already knew that there would be a period in which the actual inflation rate would exceed our 2% maximum limit. But now, given the recent further surge in oil prices, if these prices persist the period will be rather longer than we anticipated only three months ago. However, I cannot go any further than that. May I ask my colleague Mr. Trichet who has analysed this very, very carefully in order to answer that question. Trichet: Thank you very much, Wim. I would only mention the fact that foreign direct investment (FDI) was - as you have suggested - strongly negative in net terms in 1999, but, according to the present figures, (although of course we have to remain very cautious), there has been a reversal in net flows of FDI since the beginning of this year, so that there is an inflow - a net inflow - of foreign direct investment into the euro area. I think that this is the main indication that something might reverse. Trichet: I shall stick to my answer. Of course, it is absolutely clear that the investment by Vodaphone in Mannesmann is an FDI, which was registered as an FDI from outside the euro area into the euro area. One could say that what happened in 1999 was also a number of investments from the euro area to outside the euro area. So I do not think it would be fair to say that some FDI, whether it is flowing in or out, should be counted, while some should not be counted. So I am only referring myself - and it is absolutely right to say that, it was a remark which we made - I am only referring to the accounting of FDI and it seems to me that it is quite factual. Now, if you study this very, very carefully, you will probably discover that - when you take into account all flows, not only FDI, but also portfolio flows - we are in a slightly better position than before. Noyer: If I may add, it is more than that. If you take the total of direct investment plus portfolio investment, the change from one year to the other is absolutely dramatic. And this is indeed shown in the figures published by the European Central Bank. You can see that the deficit has been divided by three or four. So there has been a dramatic change in global capital flows, whatever the details of the evaluations may be. We intend to maintain our attitude. It is in our interests to be as open and transparent as we possibly can and are capable of being. And we will use every opportunity to communicate our strategy, our policies and our attitude to the general public, to the European Parliament, to the European Council of Ministers and, most of all, to the general public through speeches, publishing articles, publishing the ECB Monthly Bulletin and, I can assure you, there will also be more interviews in the future. "
05/10/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The following decisions were taken today: The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75%, starting from the operation to be settled on 11 October 2000. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 5.75%, with effect from 6 October 2000. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 3.75%, with effect from 6 October 2000. Including today's adjustment, since November 1999 we have raised ECB interest rates by a total of 225 basis points, with the objective of sustaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. Today's decisions continue to aim at ensuring that upward pressures on consumer prices stemming from oil prices and the foreign exchange rate of the euro do not translate into more permanent inflationary tendencies. It is important to address these risks adequately in order to preserve steady GDP and employment growth in the medium term. Let me explain our decisions in greater detail by reporting on our regular examination of recent monetary, financial and economic developments and their implications for monetary policy aiming to maintain price stability in the medium-term. Starting with the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, the three-month average of annual M3 growth declined to 5.3% in the period from June to August 2000, from 5.5% in the period from May to July 2000. As had been indicated earlier, in August the preparations of telecommunications firms to transfer the funds due in early September to purchase licences in the German UMTS auction appeared to have a temporary upward impact on M3 growth. Taking this special factor into account, short-term developments in monetary aggregates seem to be more moderate than the August data would suggest. This notwithstanding, from a medium-term point of view, liquidity conditions continue to be ample in the euro area. This assessment is based on the protracted deviation of M3 growth from the reference value since the start of Stage Three of EMU, coupled with the still relatively high growth of loans to the private sector. Hence, risks to price stability stemming from monetary developments remain on the upside. Turning to the second pillar, we had a thorough discussion on the main factors of relevance to the outlook for price stability at the current juncture. One important factor under examination was the price of oil, which reached new peaks in mid-September before falling to some extent more recently. Contrary to earlier expectations, energy price developments did not moderate but rather continued to put considerable upward pressure on HICP inflation rates. The low external value of the euro has heightened the risks of increases in import prices gradually being passed on to consumer prices. As you are aware, the recent movements in the exchange rate of the euro gave rise to concerns, which the ECB shared with the governors and ministers of finance of all the G7 countries, that it might have adverse implications for the world economy. In order to address these concerns, on 22 September, at the ECB's initiative, the monetary authorities of the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada joined the ECB in a concerted intervention in the foreign exchange markets. The ECB and its partners will continue to monitor developments closely and to co-operate in foreign exchange markets as appropriate. Within the euro area, data are pointing to strong real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2000, confirming our previous positive expectations for this year and for 2001. While the possibility cannot be ruled out that the increase in oil prices as such may temporarily dampen growth dynamics over the short term, the forces underlying solid growth in the medium term remain in place. These relate to external demand, which is supported by a strong world economy, as well as to domestic demand, which is supported by both continued favourable financing conditions and strong employment growth. Today's decisions should contribute to maintaining these overall prospects by preventing the emergence of expectations for inflation in the medium term. In fact, when monitoring bond market developments we saw our policy confirmed by continued expectations of lasting price stability and robust growth. We are committed to keeping this picture intact. Monetary policy continuously needs to ensure that current inflation rates do not affect inflation expectations and thereby both price-setting and wage formation. It is particularly important that this message be understood in an environment in which oil price and exchange rate developments may lead to HICP inflation rates remaining above 2% for a more protracted period than earlier expected. We are currently seeing the direct effects of such external developments on the HICP rate of inflation, with 2.3% in August and, most likely, a higher rate in September. Earlier expectations that the high annual increase in energy prices would gradually moderate in the course of 2000, owing to a levelling-off or even decline in energy prices, have not materialised thus far. Hence, it will be some time before HICP inflation returns to rates below 2%. The action which we have taken today should be understood as a means of maintaining confidence in price stability over the medium term. As I said at our previous press conference, higher oil prices imply a loss of income for the economy as a whole. In a market economy, the rise in the price of energy is to be reflected in relative price adjustments, so it should affect supply and demand in relation to both particular sources of energy as well as other goods and services. It will be important for social partners to continue to act as responsibly as they have done in the recent past. Wage moderation has made an important contribution to the progress in job creation and in reducing unemployment observed so far. A continuation of this attitude will be a key factor in contributing to non-inflationary growth at a robust pace and should ultimately result in higher employment and the preservation of real income growth for wage earners as well as in sustainable conditions for companies. The governments of the euro area countries can help the economy to adjust smoothly to the increase in energy prices in several ways. One way is to step up efforts towards structural reform aimed at enhancing the functioning of labour and product markets. This will increase the resilience of the economy to adverse shocks, increase competition and ensure appropriate price-setting by companies. Governments must avoid the mistakes of the past, when fiscal policies were relaxed in response to the effects stemming from increases in energy prices. At the current juncture, fiscal policies should avoid any pro-cyclical bias and should aim at reaching sustainable fiscal positions in the medium term more quickly. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. I will not comment on votes. And the effects that forecasts will have, which will have to be revised almost continuously, whereas we will not publish them continuously, is a normal fact of life. Circumstances change considerably and continuously and forecasts - whether they are published or not - will have to be re-assessed and re-formulated continuously as events develop. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, in the recent past it seemed if the European Central Bank was specifically insisting on surprise effects. It was surprising to have interventions on 22 September 2000 and it was equally surprising to see that you have today increased your interest rates? What about predictability and accountability? Do they no longer count, are they no longer important? Sometimes surprises cannot be avoided. As my colleague, Alan Greenspan, has said, ""sometimes surprises can be an element of policy"" and they have to be. But it is not our aim to surprise. With interventions; yes. The surprise elements are a basic factor in the success of eventual intervention. With interest rates: no. It is not our aim. And then I would like to say that the fact that interest rates would be changed in the course of the closing months of 2000 was widely recognised in the markets. The only surprise that markets and media may have perceived is the timing. And on the timing, we had our own considerations, but it was not a consideration that we wanted to surprise the markets. The direction of the move, I would like to say, cannot have come as a surprise to the markets. First, I can only repeat what I have said on earlier occasions. We do not precisely know what the so-called ""neutral rate"" is. We do believe that the monetary policy stance we have adopted today is appropriate to current circumstances, including our assessments of inflation-area developments for the medium-term future. So we do regard it as the appropriate monetary policy stance. And I cannot say anything else or more about that. In my remarks about fiscal policy and the budget in general, you can indeed derive from them, but to various degrees for various governments, that we are - to say the least - somewhat critical of the procyclical stance that seems to appear from many budgets that have been brought to our attention either confidentially or openly. First, as far as conditions on interventions and the participation of others are concerned, I would like to limit myself to referring to the Communiqué that the G7 issued in Prague, which says that the G7 partners are committed to monitoring developments very closely and to co-operating in foreign exchange markets as appropriate. The amount of the interventions? Let me say this: All the estimates that I have seen reported in the media, ranging from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 20 billion, are more or less correct. And we do believe that the best contribution to maintaining the current climate of robust, even strong growth throughout 2000 and 2001 and even beyond that is to preserve the climate of price stability. No, we see no threat to growth from this rate hike. On the contrary, we do believe that this rate hike and this monetary policy stance create the best conditions for the robust growth which is going on - and with which we do believe that the euro area has more or less reached may I call it ""cruising altitude"" after the acceleration - and for preserving that cruising altitude for the medium-term future. That's about all I am going to say about interventions. We are very satisfied with the results of the intervention. Our impression is that the number of rate hikes - which, as I said in my introduction, now amount to a total since November 1999 of 225 basis points - are working their way through: ""It ain't over yet"". They are working their way through into the economy and, of course, in the short run there is always a multitude of other factors also having an impact on inflation. But our strategy is a forward-looking and medium term-oriented, which will ensure that inflation remains under control and within the boundaries we have set for ourselves for the medium term. To answer your first question: there is no link between the intervention exercise and the rate hike of today. Today's rate hike is exclusively based on an analysis of the two pillars of our monetary strategy. In addition though, I do not deny that the two actions are, maybe you can say, ""consistent"" with each other. But there is no direct link. As to the hope that the capital outflow to the United States will be diminished, of course, there is that hope, but we do not count on it, we do not reckon with it. But the simple fact that the interest rate differential between these two great economic areas, as from today, has narrowed somewhat should be a factor helping this development. I don't want to repeat that sentence which I have said in the past, and so I won't repeat it today. We thought that 25 basis points was the appropriate answer to the assessment of future price developments which we had so carefully made. And on the first question, we do not have an exchange rate target, as should be well known by now. So today's interest rate move was in no way influenced by developments in the exchange rate, except that past developments in both oil prices and exchange rates were longer and more protracted than we had anticipated earlier andthey do work their way through orthey threaten to work their way through, both of them, into domestic inflationary expectations. But then the latter, inflationary expectations, is the only predominant reason for our move today. I find it very difficult to answer that question, for me it clears the horizon. I do not want to say anything about future developments and, above all, I cannot say anything about future developments. We will judge that when the time is ripe and the time may be a long time off. The main reason why I don't want to tell you whether there was a vote today, is that if I tell you today then I would have to tell you every two weeks. But I can assure you that there was the maximum possible degree of consensus of today's decision that is imaginable. Never. No, that is a wrong interpretation of the Maastricht Treaty. The Maastricht Treaty provides for the possibility of the Council of Ministers giving so-called general orientations for exchange rate policy. As long as the Council of Ministers has not done so, the sole body competent to decide on the ""if"" and the ""when"" and the ""level of interventions"" are the European Central Bank. In addition, the Council of Ministers - at its Summit in Luxembourg in December 1997 - decided and made it public that so-called general orientations would only be issued in very exceptional circumstances. Well, such exceptional circumstances have not arisen and, therefore, you might justifiably conclude that both the initiative for the interventions and the action itself were fully in the hands of the Governing Council of the ECB. I did not understand the last question, I must confess. The first question I can answer. We had a very extensive and useful discussion about economic developments and our assessments of today, I don't recall ... Christian ... how long it lasted. I think about 51 minutes? Noyer: Something like that. It was quite fast. As a central banker, I stay out of these discussions. May I interrupt you - perhaps the answer may prevent your second question. When I say there is no link, I mean that there is no causal relationship between one decision and the other. The intervention decision was based, amongst other things, on a common judgement shared by the ECB and its partners in the G7 that the recent developments in the exchange rate of the euro had brought and were bringing the euro so far out of line with what would be justified by the fundamentals of the various parts of the world that they threatened to distort the further development of the world economy. And that is what induced us and all our partners to try to stop this potentially detrimental movement. The interest rate decision of today was, as I said, based exclusively on our analysis in the context of our monetary policy strategy of future medium-term threats to price stability, which is our primary aim. Now, as to that the effects of the two actions are not inconsistent with each other, I stated this - as a matter of fact - but not as a causal relationship. Do you still have your second question? In taking our allotment decisions, as we do every week, we took the impact of the interventions on the liquidity conditions in the euro area into account. Well, the good of interventions becomes apparent if the results you have achieved are satisfactory. And I have already said that they were. In the subsequent allotment decisions, as I have said, we did take the liquidity developments that arose, amongst other things, from the interventions into account when deciding on the precise amount of the allotment. I thought I answered it three times already. Noyer: I could repeat it, but I cannot say different things. I can only refer to the statement, which was signed by the United States Minister, as it was by all of us including myself, in Prague, namely that we, i.e. the ECB and the G7 countries, will monitor future exchange rate developments closely and that we will co-operate in the exchange markets as appropriate. We have not decided on the precise timing yet, nor on a press conference, nor on the way forecasts will be published. It is to be expected that it will be relatively soon, as also indicated by Professor Issing in the speech he delivered at the end of last week. And I can assure you we are working very hard all across Europe to come to a result in time. As far as the press conference is concerned, I cannot imagine that we will devote a special press conference to forecasts. I can only mention that, by way of exception, the next meeting of the Governing Council - but that has nothing to do with forecasts - will be followed by a press conference, because it is to take place in Paris. We have not come to a decision on that, so that I will not speculate. "
14/09/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council of the ECB today conducted its regular examination of recent monetary and economic developments and their implications for the risks to future price stability in the euro area. Subsequently, it decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem's monetary policy instruments unchanged. Thus, the minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was left at 4.50%, and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were kept at 5.50% and 3.50%, respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. As regards the developments in the context of the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, no new monetary data have become available since our decision taken on 31 August 2000 to raise the main ECB interest rates. After having increased at a very strong pace in the first quarter of 2000, M3 growth has been showing some signs of moderation over recent months. This moderation has mainly been a consequence of lower growth in the most liquid components of M3, which bear little or no remuneration, indicating that the monetary policy measures taken since November 1999 are gradually feeding their way through. At the same time, the average of annual M3 growth rates for the period from May to July 2000, at 5.5%, continued to deviate on the upside from the reference value of 4 1/2%. The pronounced expansion of credit to the private sector up to July also suggested that households and firms continued to regard financing conditions in the euro area as favourable. In the context of the robust expansion of economic activity, continued ample liquidity conditions would constitute a risk to price stability. Turning to the second pillar, real GDP growth in the euro area, according to first estimates published by Eurostat today, reached 3 3/4% (on an annualised basis) in the first half of 2000. Currently available forecasts predict that growth will remain above 3% next year. The strength of the euro area's economic expansion in the past few months is in line with these forecasts. In fact, recent indicators suggest that, following the period of acceleration, the economic expansion may now have settled at a high rate of growth. The overall level of confidence has remained at, or close to, record highs in recent months. Moreover, employment continued to grow strongly in the first half of this year and the rate of capacity utilisation has risen further. Taken together, these factors should underpin the growth of private consumption and investment, and thus that of domestic demand. The positive outlook for the euro area is also supported by external developments. The outlook for growth of the world economy, and thus for growth of euro area exports, has remained favourable. Forecasts of world growth have consistently been revised upwards over the past few months. Expectations of a period of sustained economic growth in the euro area can also be found in euro area bond markets. Overall, longer-term bond yields in the euro area have shown a very high level of stability in the course of this year, with fluctuations being contained within a relatively narrow range. The annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was 2.4% in July 2000. Recent consumer price developments in the euro area have been very much influenced by the strong rise in oil prices and the depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro. While monetary policy cannot address short-term developments in prices, it is imperative for monetary policy that medium-term upward pressure on prices be contained. The risk that the current pressure on the HICP might spill over onto costs and prices determined in the domestic economy must be taken seriously. This holds true in particular in the context of the favourable prospects for economic growth. The Governing Council reacted to this picture by raising the main ECB interest rates at its meeting on 31 August 2000. This step followed a series of interest rate increases implemented since November 1999. The Governing Council will continue to remain alert to emerging risks to price stability. It is a matter of fact that recent oil price increases have caused the terms of trade of the euro area to deteriorate, and thus have also reduced real income. This loss of real income cannot be avoided for the economy as a whole. Attempts to shift the burden of this loss within the economy will risk endangering the continuation of a non-inflationary growth process. For the maintenance of price stability, it will be particularly important, in the current phase of strengthening economic growth, that wages continue, on average, to grow at rates compatible with the objective of price stability. Any attempt for wages to catch up in reaction to recent oil price increases would be highly detrimental to the current favourable growth prospects, since monetary policy would need to react to the resulting upward pressure on prices. Governments also have to play a role in order not to convey the false impression that the costs stemming from the increase in oil prices could be avoided by relaxing budgetary policies. This would not be in line with the needs of establishing budget positions in balance or in surplus and would complicate the fostering of tax reforms conducive to a stronger growth potential of the euro area. I should also like to reiterate that the prospects for a stronger potential for growth in the euro area will depend very much on progress made in enhancing the flexibility of labour and goods markets in the euro area. Although reform efforts in several countries have been heading in the right direction, there is still much to be done when looking at the area as a whole. Finally, let me also say a few words about recent exchange rate developments. I noted earlier that, from a monetary policy point of view, these developments are a cause for concern as they add to the upward pressure on consumer prices in the euro area. These concerns are compounded by the fact that the exchange rate of the euro does not appear appropriate when looking at economic fundamentals. As you are aware, we have been expressing this concern for some time. In the meantime, we have witnessed a considerable improvement in the economic growth prospects for the euro area. At the same time, owing to measures taken by the Governing Council, the outlook for price stability in the medium term in the euro area has remained intact. At present, inflation in the euro area is among the lowest in the world. The fact that the euro has continued to depreciate over recent months is not in line with these strong economic fundamentals in the euro area. Recent global exchange rate developments are also not in line with international balance of payments positions. Our concerns on this issue remain serious and we shall monitor developments closely. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to say a few words about other issues discussed by the Governing Council. First, I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has agreed on a TARGET reimbursement scheme for the benefit of TARGET participants in the event of malfunctioning in TARGET. The scheme will apply whenever the same-day processing of payment orders within TARGET cannot be completed. The reimbursement scheme is intended to compensate participants for certain higher costs they incur in having recourse to the standing facilities of the Eurosystem as a result of a malfunctioning. In order to ensure a level playing-field, the scheme also applies to participants in euro real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems of non-participating national central banks. The legal framework for this reimbursement scheme is reflected in an amended ""TARGET Guideline"" which, in line with the ECB's policy of enhanced transparency, will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and made available on the ECB's website shortly. Second, the Governing Council addressed issues relating to cross-border retail payment services, which are of particular interest for euro area consumers. You may recall that the ECB published a report on this subject a year ago, calling on the banking industry to improve the unsatisfactory service level for cross-border credit transfers before January 2002. Today, on the basis of a Progress Report, we have reviewed the advances of the banking industry against the objectives set by the Eurosystem and we have identified the outstanding issues that need quickly to be addressed. A press release on this topic will be issued later on today. The Progress Report will be available on the ECB's website shortly. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Question (translation): Two questions for President Duisenberg. The first question concerns your absence, which has been sharply criticised by the ministers of finance at the Versailles meeting. I would like to know why you did not feel it necessary to cancel your visit to Canada and why, on Tuesday, before the European Parliament, you said to the Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament that you had been told of the date of the Informal Meeting only two months ago. Now, according to the French Presidency, the information concerning that date was given to you at the end of last year. This is usually the case, because the whole schedule for the Presidency is known six months before the Presidency starts. This means that you should have known about this date eight months ago. So why did you say this to the European Parliament? Then the second question, concerning budgets. You are asking governments, as I understand it, not to relax fiscal discipline and I would like, therefore, to know what you think about the tax cuts which the French Government has decided to make and which tend to promote demand rather than supply. Thank you. Thank you. I was not aware that the Presidency had already informed me of this late last year, as you say. My recollection is that I learned in July about the forthcoming ECOFIN meeting. I had a meeting which was already agreed a year ago in Canada for a full-day discussion, where I was to be the only speaker, with around 150 representatives from the banking community, the former ministers of finance and ambassadors from both the United States and Canada. That meeting had been widely publicised and it is true to say that my name appearing on the invitation as the discussant had, indeed, attracted quite a number of, may I say, important representatives from the financial and political community in North America. And I felt that I could not breach that commitment, of which I informed the Presidency immediately after I became aware of the forthcoming ECOFIN meeting. Now, it would have been, I believe, the 50th ECOFIN meeting I had attended. It is the first time that the absence of a central bank governor or of a minister from such a meeting caused more than a ripple in the water. But, apparently, that happened. As far as the tax cuts by the French Government are concerned, I should like to refer to the statement I just made, in which I said that the increase in oil prices does, whether we like it or not, place a burden - it has a ""terms of trade effect"" in technical jargon - on the economy as a whole. Attempts to shift that burden inside the economy from one side to the other do not change anything. In technical jargon it is a negative terms of trade effect. And so my judgement on specific measures in specific countries must always be seen in the light of that statement, that general statement. And I am not in the habit of commenting on measures taken in individual countries of the euro area. But the message from my statement ought to be clear. Duisenberg:The decision to sell the accumulated interest receipts over the past year and a half was already taken - as we have indicated in our statement - a few weeks ago. The decision on when to do so depended very much on market conditions and on technical and tactical considerations. Now, whether you call this intervention or not, intervening in the market was not the motive which led to this decision. But, I cannot deny that the price that we will make today is, in our view, not unattractive. And, therefore, the decision was explained very clearly, I think. The sum of around EUR 2.5 billion will be sold in a relatively short time. And, this exercise will be repeated rather more frequently in the future before any such large accumulation piles up. So we will repeat this exercise as, by the way, most central banks do all the time. We will repeat it at regular intervals, which leaves us some leeway - also, again, for tactical market considerations - to determine the precise moment. I was not disappointed by the market reaction. I can say that it was not meantto damage the euro. Question (translation): Over the past few years there has been a great deal of talk about market sentiment. In your view, how great is the level of market sentiment at the moment and how significant is the psychological factor? Now, I am not in a position to quantify a psychological factor. I am not a psychiatrist. It is of course true that these factors, namely the - to my mind unduly great - attention that the exchange rate attracts in the market, in the media and among the public do play a role. People are more or less ignoring, as I said in my statement, the underlying strong fundamentals of the euro area economy. However, we are convinced that there will come a moment when these underlying fundamental factors will prevail in the markets' judgement about what the exchange rate should be. I cannot forecast when that will happen, but I am psychologically convinced that it will happen. Well, if there is the perception in Denmark that there is an image problem for the euro and that this could have an impact on Danish opinion and on the ultimate outcome of the referendum, I would be happy to try to convince the Danish people that the outlook for the euro area is a very positive one. The outlook for income and output, and thus welfare developments, is very positive indeed and I would hope that if I had the opportunity to do so I would be able to convince the Danish public that for that reason alone it would be worth joining. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, when you say that oil price rises mean that money is flowing into the oil exporting countries and you tell governments here not to do anything about this, does this mean that greater emphasis should be placed upon the first pillar of your monetary policy strategy and that you should therefore focus more on monetary aggregates? I have been misinterpreted if you have interpreted me in that way. The simple statement is that the oil price increase has a so-called terms of trade effect. It means a loss in real income for the economy as a whole. Now I was not directing myself to governments only when I said that any attempts to shift the burden of this loss in income from one sector to the other would be futile, they would not prevent the loss from being incurred. So, whether governments or employers, employees or social partners are concerned, we should all be very much aware that we cannot prevent this loss in income from actually materialising. Any attempts to try to shift the burden of the loss from one sector to another should also be judged in the light of the necessary and clearly desirable continuation of strong non-inflationary growth in the euro area and in all the individual countries. It is against this yardstick that both you and I should judge those attempts, be they by governments or social partners, or by particular interest groups, be they by truckers, by pilots or whomever. Duisenberg:Last question first: of course there is co-ordination. Second question in the middle: you have to be aware that many central banks - may I say, in this particular case, including the Deutsche Bundesbank - are in the habit of regularly selling, and have already sold, their net accruals of foreign reserves stemming from their investments in US dollars or yen. This is common practice, almost daily practice. It is the first time for the ECB, but it is certainly not the first time for a central bank. In effect, I have had many questions from you touching upon rumours in the market to the effect that there have been interventions. Is it true or not? I have always said: no. However, commercial transactions have, of course, been conducted by central banks on a continuous basis, and they are among those transactions conducted in the past. Now the first question, the most important one: does this decision signal that you are not going to sell any more or any less in the future? This decision has to be judged entirely in its own right and it says nothing about any future sales or purchases of foreign currency. As I have always said, because it is the main thrust of your question: when there are interventions in the market, I will tell you, not ex ante, but ex post. The inflation figure for July, 2.4%, was clearly influenced by developments in oil prices and import prices in general, including the depreciation of the euro exchange rate. Our expectation - based on an analysis of what we are seeing around us - is that it may indeed have proven to be the peak, but we can never be sure. However, next Monday you will have another price index figure and our expectation is that you may indeed have seen the peak. Well, as I said, I am not in the habit of commenting on developments either in the tax field or in other fields of economic policy in individual countries. Let me say this: if these tax measures had become a euro area-wide trend, then I would have been disappointed. I believe I have already made those comments in my introductory statement and I have nothing to add to it. That answers the question I just dodged by referring to my introductory statement and it answers this. We are of the opinion that liquidity conditions, as I have said, are still ample. And that is not by way of an experiment. Now I take issue with the statement that the US economy seems to be stabilising at a rate of 4%. We do not know that. And Mr. Greenspan does not know that either. We do think that in the course of the coming two years the growth performance of the euro area will not stay below, and may even go beyond, the growth performance of the United States, remarkably and admirably high as it is. But we think that we will be able to match that performance in Europe in the coming years. And that is one of the main reasons which, in my mind, underpins our assessment that the strengthening of the euro will come. For I happen to agree with you that the growth differential, which we have observed over the past number of years, is one of the main explanatory items or causes for the depreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar. As to whether it is the full explanation, as you seem to be implying, there I have my doubts. If oil prices were to remain at the high levels where they have landed, so to speak, then it would have the effect of, as I said, a loss of income, a loss of real growth. But that has to be compared against the growth that would otherwise have to take place. So, we do not yet know precisely. There are already estimates around from various institutions and organisations of what the real impact of the persistently high level of oil prices will be. Those estimates vary from 0 to 1 percentage point. We have not yet reached the stage, I must confess, where we feel in a position to be able to quantify precisely what this is. And if we had reached that stage I am not sure whether I would tell you. But that it has a negative impact on the growth figure as such if the prices were to stay there, that is undeniable. That is certain. The second question was on the tax measures again. No, I am not going to go into the precise measures that governments should take in whatever tax field or expenditure field. I am just urging governments to stick to the goals of - over the medium term - getting their houses in order, bringing their budget into balance or with a small surplus, and continuing the efforts of - also through tax measures - making markets more flexible and changing the structure of the tax system so that it helps to fight unemployment. All measures should always be seen in that light. Well, I can assure you that I have given you my opinion about interventions and I will tell you about them once they have occurred, but not before that. However, I can assure you that neither I nor my colleagues have any need for guts. That, at least, is our gut feeling. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, how much money, how many hundreds of millions of euro and US dollars are transacted on the currency markets every day? Have you any idea of that? That leads me to my next question: you said that there is something by which one ought to explain the weakness of the euro, I mean there has been growth in Europe - even the Americans have noticed that - interest rates have gone up, the differential has come down, so what is the problem with the euro? Is it that the Anglo-Saxon financial markets are really against this new currency and are speculating against it because they are saying that political integration is not good enough and that there is going to be further enlargement? And if you do not want to say what you think about this, then clearly there is something wrong, because there are some things you have been saying that you cannot explain and you have been saying so for the past year, so what is going on? The daily turnover in the foreign exchange market, Christian, is it a trillion? Noyer: Something of the sort, but I do not think it has any relevance to the issues we discussed today. With a view to the size of the market, there are a number of transactions that are nationally balanced, so making a comparison between any such decision by one actor to do one thing and the global amount of the market does not make any sense. I do not think you can infer any conclusion from that. The majority of operations are by nature balanced, so I do not think that this can lead you to a proper conclusion. Second part of your question then. When I answered Anatole Kaletsky and said that I agreed with him that the growth differential between the two major economic areas in the world was a large part of the explanation for the exchange rate developments, I said a large part, i.e. there is more which I cannot fully explain. And there are many factors, like the ones you quoted, which also have an impact. With the benefit of hindsight we can sometimes identify those factors. However, then there is also the phenomenon that markets have a tendency to overshoot in one direction or another. It is a temporary phenomenon. It does not mean that markets are not right. Markets are, of course, always right, but overshooting means that at some point there will be a reversal. And it is that point which I am so anxiously awaiting. Noyer: The answer to the first question is ""no"". And the answer to the second question is ""no reaction"". Duisenberg:Again, I cannot judge the psychological impact. The economic impact upon the euro would, given the size of the Danish economy in relation to the euro area economy, be negligible for the euro area. For Denmark it is a different matter. Denmark would, with such a decision, give up all the potential benefits of membership of Monetary Union. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, how do you assess suggestions from the German banking industry such as, for instance, the suggestion that the European Central Bank should not intervene, but should announce very clearly that it intends to sell large quantities of currency reserves and obtain benefits for the national treasuries and, therefore, continue with debt reduction? The reserves of both the ECB and the NCBs are entirely and exclusively in the hands of the national central banks themselves and I am inclined to ignore advice such as that which seems to be coming from the German banking community. The answer to the last question is ""yes"". As long as there are no so-called ""general orientations"" being issued by the Council of Ministers, which is possible according to the Treaty, albeit that the Council of Ministers said at the Luxembourg summit three years ago that the issuance of such general orientations would only be considered in very exceptional circumstances. Thus, as long as such general orientations have not been issued, the day-to-day management of the foreign exchange market - and that includes whether or not to intervene - is in the hands of the Governing Council of the ECB. I believe I cannot be clearer than that. Now, is the liquidity to accommodate possible second-round effects already there? I can only say that the growth of M3 over the past year and a half and the growth in credit to the private sector month after month after month over the past year and a half were both far in excess of what we call our reference value and both point to the fact that liquidity conditions at present can be characterised as still being ample. What they are being used for is a different matter, which we do not decide upon. But they are ample. As for your third question as to whether the sale of our interest income from foreign exchange has something to do with pressure from financial circles or finance ministers to start interventions, I should like to point out that I cannot imagine that you can conclude that the fact that these pressures were there is something of the last few days or maybe the last week. The decision to divest these accrued interest receipts was already taken on 31 August ... ... yes, but I can assure you that in preparing decisions we are also forward-looking. So, preparing a decision on 31 August took place a long time before 31 August. Sorry, I did not say it was inappropriate, but I said that if an economic agent, be it a government, employers or employees, wants to try to shift that burden, this must always be assessed in the light of the fact that for the domestic economy the economic loss will be there, wherever the loss is being borne. And any measures taken by whomsoever, be it governments or other economic agents, must be assessed against the background of long-term structural policy aims which will be there, which are there, oil price increases or not. I have a great understanding for governments. I can always fully understand - but that has nothing to do with my job as a central banker - that governments may be inclined to alleviate the burden for some and make it even heavier for others or to find room in their budgets by cutting expenditure in order to take countermeasures on account of the weakest categories in society. I have full understanding for that but, as I say, it has to be assessed against the background of the fact that the loss to the economy as a whole cannot be avoided and one cannot get around this fact. The specific measures which whatever pressure group or government or economic agent, in general, is contemplating has to be assessed against the long-term goals of the official policy. It has to be evaluated against the background of the structure of the fiscal system and of deficits. And then you can come to a conclusion as to whether the specific action taken is appropriate or not. That I leave to the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say I leave it up to the national authorities to come to their own conclusions and maybe even to make these public. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, Prague is next week and the week after that. I would like to ask, what do you think the chances are of a change to the Plaza or Louvre agreements? How high do you think the probability is of that? Not high. The question is, how do I see the chances of there being a renewal or modification of the Plaza or Louvre agreements of the past. Well, let me say this, I know what is on the agenda for Prague. I also know what the agenda for the G7 meeting will be and the point you mentioned is not on the agenda. "
06/07/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr. Papademos, Governor of the Bank of Greece, to whom the Governing Council has extended a standing invitation following the EU Council's decision on Greece's adoption of the euro on 1 January 2001. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of recent monetary and economic developments and their implications for the risks to future price stability in the euro area. Subsequently, it decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem's monetary policy instruments unchanged. Thus the minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was left at 4.25%, and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were kept unchanged at 5.25% and 3.25% respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. In the context of the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, let me start with the latest monetary developments in the euro area. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from March to May 2000, stood at 6.3%, which was unchanged from the period from February to April 2000. At 6.3%, M3 growth was substantially above the reference value of 4 1/2%. This deviation of M3 growth from the reference value, combined with the strong growth of both M1 and credit to the private sector, indicates that liquidity conditions continued to be ample in the euro area through May. The increase in ECB interest rates on 8 June - in conjunction with the interest rate increases made since November 1999 - exerts a moderating influence on both money and credit growth. Turning to the second pillar of our strategy, considering real economic developments, recent data indicate that the euro area economy has continued to grow at a robust pace. The first estimate of real GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was 0.7%. Although this was slightly below the average observed in the second half of last year, other indicators all point towards strong growth of the domestic economy. The rate of growth of industrial production, for example, not only increased in April, but also incorporated an upward revision for the first quarter. Industrial and consumer confidence both remain at, or close to, record high levels. At the same time, external developments are continuing to provide a positive stimulus to economic growth in the euro area. Reflecting favourable domestic and external conditions for growth, the outlook for euro area growth continues to be positive. There have not been any major changes in bond and foreign exchange markets since the decision of the Governing Council on 8 June to raise the ECB interest rates. Current bond market yields continue to show market expectations of a period of sustained economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, the accumulated depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro remains a cause for concern and has to be taken into account in the assessment of the risks to price stability. As regards consumer price developments, inflation in May 2000, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), remained at 1.9%. A lower year-on-year change in services prices offset relatively strong rises in other prices, in particular energy and unprocessed food prices. Over the coming months the rate of increase in consumer prices could continue to be affected by lagged effects of the increase in import prices. For the outlook for price stability in the medium term, it is essential that these short-term movements of inflation do not become protracted and translate into second round effects. Overall, the outlook for price stability will be affected by several factors, which will need to be monitored carefully. First, strong monetary growth and ample liquidity conditions call for continuous monitoring. In addition, it will be important, in the current phase of strengthening economic growth, for wages to continue, on average, to grow at rates compatible with the objective of price stability. This, together with structural reform in the labour market, will be important to sustain the process of non-inflationary growth and to reduce unemployment in the euro area. Developments in import prices, which are influenced by the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro and the price of raw materials, may affect the outlook for prices in the period ahead. Finally, I should like to stress that a pro-cyclical loosening of the fiscal policy stance could also add to upward risks to price stability. In this respect, when looking at the euro area as a whole on a consolidated basis, current fiscal budget plans are not sufficiently ambitious in view of the favourable economic prospects. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to say a few words about other issues discussed by the Governing Council. First, I should like to address the euro banknote-related issue concerning the determination of the number of banknotes to be printed before the launch date of 1 January 2002. The latest forecast shows that there will be a need to put 14 billion euro banknotes into circulation, compared with last year's estimate of 13 billion. The increase can be attributed to three main factors: a higher than expected figure for national banknotes in circulation, which forms the basis of estimates of the launch stocks; a higher forecast for the use of low-denomination banknotes; and a somewhat slower than previously expected development in the use of electronic money. Second, the Governing Council also had an exchange of views on recent developments in the EU banking industry. The discussion was based on preparatory work by the Banking Supervision Committee. The Governing Council is well aware that the current process of consolidation is no longer confined to small and medium-sized banks - as it was in the past - but that now it also covers the larger banks at the national level and cross-border mergers and alliances are on the increase. The role of the euro as a factor encouraging this process of consolidation via further integration of money and capital markets is important. The consolidation process is welcome in general since it allows efficiency gains to be achieved in the banking sector. On the other hand, it affects the competitive environment in which banks operate, as well as their risk profile. Therefore, a careful monitoring on the part of the public authorities responsible for prudential supervision and financial stability is required. The Governing Council decided that a report on mergers and acquisitions involving the EU banking industry be prepared for publication in the autumn. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Duisenberg:All indications are, indeed, that developments in the United States are slowing down somewhat, but I would certainly not qualify this as an external shock, because all indications are that the US economy is in for what we had all hoped for, namely a soft rather than a hard landing. So I would not call this an external shock and I think the euro area economy will be able to weather this storm or - as I would prefer to call it - this weak wind with ease. He did not mention the referendum issue. So I can also forget about your second question. With regard to your third question as to whether the sanctions should be lifted, I would like to emphasise that the European Central Bank is totally independent of political influence and that is not only a right, but also an obligation. We, too, should not try to exert any political influence. That is what we give in return for being independent ourselves. So the issues you have raised do not in any way have an influence on our co-operation with the Austrian national bank, which is an integral part of the European System of Central Banks, nor on that with its mother state, so to speak. First of all, I would prefer to leave a judgement and an evaluation of the Japanese economy to the relevant authorities and I would like to limit myself to commenting on the European economy. And the second question is a very hypothetical one on a change in the monetary policy stance in Japan, and, well, let me say that I never give answers to hypothetical questions. First of all, we are extremely satisfied with our experience of the first two tenders of the variable rate type, combined with the minimum bid, which we allowed and announced. This experience has been very satisfactory. The reason for changing to this new system, as you may know, was the practice of ever-lower allotment rates, which we had to accept, which made the whole system assume grotesque features. We believe - or rather can observe - that this phenomenon has disappeared, and in the first two tenders where market expectations were not moving in any particular direction, the effective rates and the marginal rates have stayed very close to the minimum bid rate. We expect this to remain the case, as long as market expectations do not change significantly, and we see no reason why they should. On the first issue of the appointment of another ""Mr. Euro"" or an extra ""Mr. Euro"", I am not in opposition to it, nor am I in favour of it, and I take note of what has been said. On the exchange rates, I can only repeat that it is still our firm belief, given economic developments in both Europe, on the one hand, and the United States, on the other, that the euro has a strong potential to appreciate over time. And, looking at the developments of the past few weeks or even months, I would not go along with your statement that the recovery seems to have faltered. Well, it is one of the indicators which we carefully watch in the context of the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy, but only one. And the precise relationship between increases in producer prices and their translation, ultimately, into consumer prices is a rather loose one. So, it being only one of a wide range, a broad range of indicators, and the relationship being a loose one, I cannot give a precise answer to the question as to what precisely the impact will be in the future. It is one of the things we look at. And it is one of the reasons why we still think that the risks to price stability are on the upside, rather than on the downside. Question (translation): Mr. President, yesterday in Strasbourg, speaking at the European Parliament, you said that the promised forecasts would become available towards the end of this year. That is also going to be the time, probably, when the Governing Council establishes the reference value. Are you going to combine those decisions? Because at that time you will have to decide whether you will stick to your rate of less than 2% as meaning that we continue not to have inflation. What are your plans, please? We will review, as we have announced, our reference value for monetary growth in December, which we do once a year. One thing is almost as certain, namely that we will publish forecasts, probably towards the end of the year. Of course, these forecasts will then be one of the inputs, but only one, used in coming to a judgement on what the reference value will be. However, if I already knew the forecasts now, I could just as well publish them now. But I do not know them yet, so I can do no more than answer your question in these vague terms, and certainly not in quantitatively precise terms. I recommend August. Because that is when I take my vacation. The precise responsibility for the forecasts? We are preparing that. A decision has not been taken yet. The complication, as you very well know, is the following. Many institutions publish forecasts, but not many institutions which publish forecasts are, at the same time, responsible for policies. And we have to make it understood by the public and by everybody, also by you, that forecasts have great benefits, but that they also have limitations. They normally become outdated very quickly. They are based on certain hypotheses regarding so-called exogenous variables or exogenous factors. And they are only one of the inputs for the subsequent taking of monetary policy decisions. So we have to be very careful in explaining that. And as to who will take responsibility for them - we are still discussing this. We certainly do not want, at least I, do not want to make the Governing Council as such responsible for the forecast and, therefore, also accountable for the forecast. Because the Governing Council has, in making monetary policy decisions, to take many, many more factors into account than only a forecast, which will be produced as a combined effort by ECB staff and staff of the national central banks. So, in a way, to put it fairly honestly, we would like to keep our hands free and we have to explain why. I think that this explanation has to be very extensive and very well understood. As for banking supervision - as you know, the ECB as such has only a very limited mandate in the area of banking supervision. It is our view that a close connection between banking supervision and central banking is of the essence, both for supervisors and for the central banks. So that is a close connection. I am not saying that it always has to be done by central banks. But the very close connection, as I have said, is regarded as very important for both policies, for supervisory policy and for monetary policy. Matters have developed pretty much the way we expected them to. And all the data we have received have confirmed or strengthened our view that Europe is well under way in and into a period of robust economic growth, with inflation - although close to the edge - being kept under control. But all the data that have come out also confirm our assessment that the risks are on the upside, rather than on the downside. Yes, if I look outside, it is beautiful. Yes, but there is no other message than that which I have just given. We believe that our decision of 8 June 2000 to raise interest rates was and still is appropriate in the light of the circumstances and the economic developments as we see them and as we evaluate them. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, introducing a new currency is a great challenge. Therefore, a half-sporting, half-monetary question - you know that the Dutch have lost against the Italians in particular. What should one do in order not to lose such important matches in Europe? On this question, because I was there when the penalty kicks were taken, I must confess that I am still angry. And it is better not to comment in an emotional state. We prefer, as I said earlier, central banks to be closely involved in the process of banking supervision. Closely involved means closely connected to or associated with ... Oh, that is very precise. There are various models available to achieve this. In a number of countries it is the national central bank which is responsible for banking supervision. We have no interest in doing that. We are perfectly happy with leaving actual supervision in national hands. And the ECB, or the Eurosystem, is not part of a movement to ""europeanise"" or centralise banking supervision or other ways of supervision. What we are doing at the European level is to contribute to a close co-ordination of the supervisory regimes in the various Member States and to contribute to making the playing field level. "
08/06/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions: The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 4.25% and applied in the two operations (which will be conducted as fixed rate tenders) to be settled on 15 and 21 June 2000. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 5.25%, with effect from 9 June 2000. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 3.25%, with effect from 9 June 2000. Starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as variable rate tenders, applying the multiple rate auction procedure. The Governing Council has decided to set a minimum bid rate for these operations equal to 4.25%. This is the same rate as that which will prevail for the two fixed rate tenders to be implemented following today's decision. Let me start by commenting on the reasons for this rise in interest rates, before the Vice-President says a few words about the move to a variable rate tender procedure. Over recent months the risks to price stability in the medium term have clearly continued to increase. This assessment has been supported by the information from both the first pillar and the second pillar of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy. With regard to the first pillar, strong growth of money and credit throughout 1999 and the pronounced expansion of money and credit aggregates over the first four months of 2000 have strengthened the view that liquidity conditions are ample. As for the second pillar, in a phase of strong growth upward risks to price stability currently relate mainly to the spillover of rising import prices to consumer prices, owing both to the lagged effects of the exchange rate depreciation and to rising oil prices. In fact, most inflation forecasts have been revised upwards over recent months. This is a matter of concern. Today's increase in ECB interest rates is a decisive step to address these upside risks to price stability and it will contribute to the continuation of non-inflationary growth in the euro area. Allow me to give you a more detailed overview of the main elements of our assessment of monetary, financial market and other economic developments. Let me start by addressing the latest monetary developments in the euro area. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from February to April 2000, was 6.3%, i.e. significantly above the reference value of 4 1/2%. Thus, the most recent M3 data confirm that the liquidity situation in the euro area continues to be very generous. M3 growth deviated from the reference value in 1999 and growth rates increased further in early 2000. This picture of very generous liquidity conditions in the euro area is complemented by the rapid expansion of credit to the private sector, which remained close to or above 10% throughout 1999 and exceeded 11% in April 2000. Taken together, such developments would clearly point to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, if not counteracted in time. Turning to the second pillar, we have to consider economic and financial market developments as well as consumer price developments. Looking at economic developments, the outlook for growth in the euro area has improved markedly over the past few months. Overall, indicators for economic activity released since the end of last year point to continued strong growth, following the upturn in real GDP growth in the second half of 1999. All the forecasts currently available from major international organisations and private institutions now project real GDP growth to be above 3% this year and next year, which is significantly higher than expected at the end of last year. This positive outlook reflects favourable domestic and external conditions for growth. On the domestic side, expansion of private consumption and investment should benefit, in particular, from ongoing employment growth and higher rates of capacity utilisation. Domestic demand is also supported by high business and consumer confidence. On the external side, the upturn of growth in the world economy appears to be stronger, faster and more broadly based than was expected at the end of last year. Hence, euro area exports should remain strong. Financial market developments also support the view that the economic expansion in the euro area is set to continue at a fast pace. Moreover, the exchange rate of the euro appreciated at the end of May and in the first few days of June, also reflecting expectations that robust economic growth will continue in the euro area. Notwithstanding the recent appreciation of the euro, the extent and duration of its previous depreciation will still exert upward pressure on consumer prices. Against this background, the outlook for consumer price developments had become less favourable prior to today's meeting. In April 2000 inflation - as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) - was 1.9%, following 2.1% in March. In the immediate future, the strong rise in oil prices in May 2000 is pointing to renewed short-term upward pressures. Looking further ahead, all available forecasts for consumer price inflation for this year and next are now higher than they were at the end of 1999. Current projections of a rate of inflation of around 2% in 2000 and 2001 are clear warning signals. In conclusion, with today's decisions the Governing Council has acted in a forward-looking manner in order to contribute to the maintenance of favourable conditions for a lasting, non-inflationary economic expansion. This should help other economic actors to rely firmly on the maintenance of price stability in the medium term. They are also called upon to contribute to price stability and growth by means of appropriate wage settlements compatible with employment growth, structural reform and fiscal consolidation. At the current juncture, they are especially encouraged to press ahead with structural reform, and governments are particularly urged to avoid a pro-cyclical loosening of fiscal policies. This is particularly important in those countries where there is a risk of overheating. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to say a few words about the decision to implement a variable rate tender procedure as from the main refinancing operation to be settled on 28 June 2000. The switch to variable rate tenders in the main refinancing operations is not intended as a further change in the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem. The new tender mechanism is a response to the severe overbidding which has developed in the context of the current fixed rate tender procedure. For the purpose of signalling the monetary policy stance, the minimum bid rate is designed to play the role performed, until now, by the rate in fixed rate tenders. This change does not in any way rule out the option that, in the future, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem may be conducted in principle as fixed rate tenders. A press release setting out a comprehensive description of the new tender procedure will be issued during the course of next week. Turning to today's other meeting, the General Council considered public finance developments in the EU. The General Council also carried out its first annual review of the functioning of the ERM II, in accordance with Article 16 of the ERM II Agreement. Finally, let me draw your attention to the calendar for meetings of the Governing Council and General Council in 2001. A separate press release listing the dates as well as the related dates for the press conferences will be made available to you this afternoon. In this context, I should also like to point out that the press conference previously announced for 3 August 2000 has been cancelled. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Noyer: Well, in answer to your first question: no, you cannot say it is a target rate because the tender procedure which we will then use is technically very different from the procedure that the Fed uses to influence the market. The signalling effect of what was previously our refinancing rate (in a fixed rate tender) will now be provided by the minimum bid rate. But we will not be targeting that rate as such. Now, it is a fact, of course, and it is the experience of many national central banks which used different types of variable rate tenders before the euro, that market rates normally come close to the minimum rate. It is the market forces that bring them down, it is not a target in the sense that you could say the Federal Reserve has a target. On your second question: normally there are binding mechanisms which mean that it cannot move very far from the minimum. But this is mainly due to market forces. If you bid very high, then it is very likely that market rates will be lower than the rate at which you will be allocated central bank money. So you risk losing money. A built-in mechanism brings rates closer to the minimum bid rate. Noyer: Well, there are many possible technical devices. This one was seen as closer to the one that we had wanted from the beginning. I should like to remind you that from the outset we had said that we had two possible tools. One was fixed rate tenders and the other was variable rate tenders. For the fixed rate tenders, we started with the idea that we should be able to provide the market with approximately the liquidity that we thought it needed. This is very much how this was done before by most central banks in the euro area. If you move to a 100% fixed rate allocation system, a fixed rate tender allocation system, then you leave the amount of liquidity that it would draw from the central bank completely in the hands of the market. It is quite a different system and the consequences would have to be studied extremely carefully. It has, of course, worked in small countries: whether it can work in a large area is difficult to assess, but this is certainly something we have considered. For variable rates, by contrast, we had said from the beginning that we wanted to have that tool available and we have studied the various possible features of this variable rate system for many months. Now, finally, we have found out that the best possible way to use it would be relatively close, in terms of signalling procedure, to the fixed rate tender, so that we could shift from one to the other without blurring market players at all, i.e. a combination of the variable rate tender with a minimum bid rate. Then you have a tool which provides the signalling effect that we had before in the fixed rate tenders. And I would like to reiterate and re-emphasise that this switch to the variable rate tender procedure in no way implies a change in monetary policy stance. It is purely inspired by the worsening situation in the bidding process, whereby the last two allotment ratios were less than 1% each, at 0.88% and 0.87% respectively, which made it almost ridiculous. That is what triggered this move to the new system. But we still want to be as much in the lead in giving interest rate signals, as we were under the fixed rate tender system. However, I should also add that this switch in no way rules out the possibility that we may, at some point, return to the fixed rate tender system. No, one of the motives to move by half a point is that, in our view, such a move will clear the horizon for some time to come. We do not know for how long. We wanted to give certainty and clarity to the markets for some time to come. Well, I do not know what financial markets will expect, but we think with this move we have cleared the horizon, although it may be a moving horizon. Question (translation): Mr. President, I would like to have your feeling on a few things. Do you think that the previous rises in rates have had a favourable effect on the euro exchange rate, which is now appreciating against the dollar? That is the first question. Second question: do you not think that we are going to accredit the idea that, for the ECB, a rate of growth of 3% is the maximum rate of growth that the euro area can support? The previous hikes in interest rates may have had an effect on the turn-around in the sentiment about the exchange rate. If that is so, then it is only welcome. But those interest rate moves and the one of today were in no way a reaction to the exchange rate developments, because we do not have, as you know, an exchange rate target. Yet, as a side effect, if they have helped to change the sentiment, then we are only grateful. The current forecasts for growth for both years, as I have said, by many institutions, and our own analysis, point to a rate of growth in excess of 3%, both in 2000 and in 2001. But there still is under-utilisation of capacity - the output gap may be closing, but I would not say that we would want to cap growth in any way at this stage and at this rate. On the contrary, we believe that the interest rate move of today creates the conditions for a sustained period of non-inflationary but high growth. On the Euro-11: that is still an informal organisation, with which the ECB is in a continuous dialogue. The organisation of the Euro-11 is a matter for ministers and not for the European Central Bank. The position of the European Central Bank is very clear and well-defined in the Treaty of Maastricht. So, whatever way the ministers organise themselves, it does not - I am inclined to say - affect the position or the co-operation of the European Central Bank. As for how the public perceives our two-pillar strategy, admittedly, it is not a simple strategy. We do our utmost to explain our two pillar-based strategy and we have the impression that it is becoming better and better understood. I recall that in the past days a few outside experts - basing themselves explicitly on the reasoning in our two-pillar strategy - came to the conclusion that if you applied this strategy, then there was no question but to think that the ECB would raise interest rates by 50 basis points. Well, they at least had understood it. I do not really see a problem. The competence for exchange rates is also clearly defined in the Treaty. For day-to-day business, and if there are no specific exchange rate arrangements, there is only one institution competent for exchange rates - and that is the European Central Bank. What ministers can do, and may do at some point, perhaps, is to give general orientations. They can only do so in consultation with, or on a proposal from, the European Central Bank. So I do not see any problem there. I must say that, in the continuous dialogue which the European Central Bank has with the Euro-11, we have managed to an ever greater degree, let me put it that way, to restrain ourselves, both governors and ministers, from making comments about monetary or exchange rate developments. Admittedly, we may not be 100% successful, but to my mind, we are increasingly successful in speaking with one voice - both ministers and governors. You will be aware that I never comment on that. We had an intensive discussion, a prolonged discussion, which was very useful and, in the end, resulted in a consensus on what we had to do. Not today. I know that the exchange rate of the euro, even after the recent appreciation, does not yet reflect the fundamentals, whatever they may be. But I am not in a position to declare a certain value to be the right value. That is what the markets decide. And when it does reflect the fundamentals, you will not hear me saying anything either. Yes, I already implicitly gave that advice in my introductory statement as we urge governments, in this high growth period, not to exert pro-cyclical impulses through tax reductions which would endanger the inflation performance of the euro area economy. So, by implication, that means that we hope these extra revenues, as they come in, be they from privatisation or licensing of GSM features or from cyclically higher tax revenues, will be used to the maximum extent possible to strengthen the process of consolidation of the public finances, in other words, to reduce the deficit and to reduce the burden of debt. On the first question: I do not think that we are mirroring the Fed. On the question of overkill, we had, of course, thought of that, but we did not see that danger. I would like to point out that, even after the increase of today - and now I am talking about short-term interest rates - rates are still at a level which should encourage growth, given the prospects of the non-inflationary environment promoted by this move. It will promote growth rather than stifle it, and I would also like to point out that the case of the United States proves that you can have a very high rate of growth with considerably higher interest rates than those prevailing in Europe. Noyer: Trying to answer your request and, at the same time, keeping matters simple at this stage, it will be in the form of an American auction, i.e. all the banks will get the liquidity at the price that they have requested down to what we call the marginal rate. That is the rate at which we stop providing liquidity or the last rate at which we will provide liquidity. All the requests made at higher levels of interest rates will be served 100%. At the marginal rate, the ECB may allot either 100% or less. That depends on the global amount we want to provide. And how will this amount of liquidity be decided? Well, more or less exactly as it was or is being done under the fixed rate tender system. We compute the level of liquidity we think the banking sector needs and then allocate according to these needs, taking into account all the various factors, not only the minimum reserves, but all the factors that influence liquidity. For the purpose of giving some clarity to all market players, it is our intention, when we announce the tender, to signal what we believe the liquidity needs to be. We will not say we will allocate X billion, because this has to be fine-tuned until the last moment and we cannot - nobody can - know in advance exactly how much liquidity will be needed. Our intention is to give some kind of forecast of the liquidity needs to the market, so that it helps market participants to make their own computations of how they will make their proposals or requests in the tender procedure. This has been much simplified, but I hope it clarifies matters somewhat. If it does not, I am sorry, you will have to wait another week, unless you ask me more precise questions that I'll forget to answer. Duisenberg. On the first question: not knowing what the neutral rate is, I cannot answer the question whether or not we are still accommodative. I think we are. But even after this interest rate hike, one thing is certain: we are less accommodative than we were before. On your second question: well, an assessment, as I gave it to you, of all recent indicators and comparing them with the assessment we had made towards the end of last year, they increasingly point to significantly higher future inflation than we thought only four months ago. And these are the monetary indicators: the forecasts made by others, the development of the exchange rates up until two weeks ago, the development of oil prices - there has been some decline, but an immediate rebound after that - all make us increasingly concerned that, over the medium term, inflation might - if we did not act decisively - exceed the 2% limit which we have set for ourselves. We believe that, with this move, combined with the moves we have made since November last year, we will avoid that danger. Question (translation): Mr. President, a further question. How long do you think you are going to need to raise the interest rates for them to bite? I mean there are American, German, Dutch positions on that. This was the first question. The second question is that the dollar is a yo-yo. Is the euro also a yo-yo currency? You said that you were not quite happy with the current exchange rate? Could you tell us exactly how unsatisfied you are? Is it on a scale of 1, 2, 3...? To answer the last question first: I said the exchange rate, in my opinion, has - in the past, in recent months - clearly overshot a level which could be regarded as being more in line with the fundamentals. And the reversal which started about two weeks ago still leaves, I believe, some potential for further appreciation. To what level, as I already said earlier, I cannot say. The yo-yo - no - the volatility is very high, even in the course of a trading day. But a yo-yo? I would not say that. The euro has depreciated over the last 12 months at a steady, almost continuous pace - there is nothing yo-yo about that - and that trend now seems to have reversed. So, if you call this a yo-yo, then at least it is a long-term yo-yo. Question (translation): I had asked whether the dollar being a yo-yo currency means that the euro is one too. I do not talk about currencies in terms of yo-yos. If I may answer the question first. When we started the discussion, there was more than one who was inclined more to go for 25 than for 50 basis points. But then you have a discussion, which takes hours, and you exchange all the arguments. And in the end, as I said, we reached a consensus that the measures would be what they are and as they have been decided. Noyer: On the second question: I would not say that it is in any way a step towards giving the markets more influence on the decisions or monetary policy, or actions - whatever you call it - of the central bank. I think you should consider what will be the average rate in the tenders, or even the marginal rate, as absolutely comparable to the market rates. So, whatever difference there might be between the average rate of a tender, the marginal rate and the minimum rate, it should be considered in exactly the same way as you would consider the difference between overnight or one-week/two-week rates, as compared with the fixed tender rate. So, really, this is why I said the minimum rate has the same signalling effect as the fixed rate had in the fixed tender procedure. But, of course, there are technical differences. We are not tightening or keeping the market at a certain given rate through constant interventions in the money markets. We will let the market play its role. And what the market does is actually interesting. It provides us with information that is part, a small part, of our global assessment of what is going on and how market players themselves analyse the same sort of economic indicators we are looking at. When we look at the oil prices we of course also look at futures. And the futures indicate that the oil price may at some point fall, but they have already done that for a long time. The oil price is not falling and has not fallen. So we try to assess, to the best of our knowledge, what is not always an accurate guide. And I have actually asked the same question you have just asked me: I asked my colleague from Saudi Arabia that question last weekend, and I got an answer which was as vague as that which I am giving you. Will it work its way through? Will it push consumer prices up or down? I think the evidence indicates ""yes"", with a lag, but in both directions. When oil prices come down, you will - after a while - also see petrol prices coming down for the consumer, and you even saw that happening by a few cents this week and, when they go up, you see with a lag - which may be several months on average - that these prices work their way through to the consumer price level as well. Whether there is an optimum price - as was asked - I would not know. There probably is, but not for the central bank. Noyer: I think that, very theoretically, maximum bid rates can only work in a situation where there are strong expectations that the central bank might wish to cut rates. In that way, yes. But, in a normal stance, where there is no great anticipation in one or the other direction - for very technical reasons, but you may already have seen that with the fixed rate tender - money market rates are normally on average - that does not mean every day - a few basis points above the rate at which the central bank provides liquidity. For that reason, the system can normally work much better with a minimum rate than with a maximum rate. So it is just that the signalling effect - even if, theoretically, it could be provided by both systems - works well only with a minimum rate system. To answer the last question first: I think you have to distinguish between two things. What I said two months ago was a statement about the month-to-month path of inflation which was to be expected for the near future. And already then, even earlier, I gave an indication that it should not be excluded - as we saw the path developing - that, temporarily, it would even exceed 2% in the actual figures. And I forecast that that would be only temporary, that it would come down. So far, I have been proven right by the facts - the April figure being under 2% again, although the March figure was 2.1%. In a medium-term outlook - I am now talking about the average inflation figures for the full years 2000 and 2001 - the average inflation figure is now expected to be very close to 2%. Perhaps, on the basis of some forecasts, it could even go over that average figure. And why is that so? That is because of the many factors I have mentioned. And the main one is that the higher than expected import prices as a result of higher than expected oil prices, other raw material prices, and the prolonged, depressed state of the exchange rate will work their way through more than could be anticipated two or four months ago. And it is to counter that development that we have taken measures today to prevent the forecasts for 2000 and 2001 from becoming true. Question (translation): Two questions. Is my impression right that the first pillar of your strategy is gaining more and more in importance because it is reliable? Second question: the reference level of 4 1/2%. You have a trend rate of growth of 2 1/2% as being calculated into that. Now, does that mean that over 3% economic growth at the moment is the reason why inflation could be above 2%? Or are you expecting a higher potential rate of growth? There is no change in weighting, since we have never weighted the first and the second pillars. And, if we could give you a ratio, a mathematical ratio between the weight of the first and that of the second pillar, then we would also be in a position mathematically to reduce the two pillars to one. It is as simple as that. So, there is no change in the weighting - which is a qualitative assessment. The strong growth we foresee goes along also with what we are observing - a rather strong increase in productivity. And whether that will lead to a higher potential growth rate is something we do not know yet. The reference value of 4 1/2% was indeed based, as you say, on an estimate of the trend rate of growth, or the potential rate of growth of output, of about 2 1/4%, which is the trend rate observed over the past 25 years. It is a reference value only, something to use for comparison from which conclusions can be drawn. It will be reviewed every year. And then, we have to come to a judgement on whether or not that 2 1/2% hypothesis can still be regarded as valid. But we will only do that in December this year. In answer to the first question, I did not talk about intervention today. So you may conclude that we did not intervene. And I said that I would only talk about interventions ex post, i.e. after we have intervened and, then, immediately thereafter. So, no discussions about interventions. And the fact that we cancelled the press conference on 3 August has nothing to do with our decisions today. It has everything to do - I shall be honest enough to say - with the fact that it is an awkward date to have a meeting. Because, in many countries, the summer holidays will already have started and we are doing our utmost to arrange the agenda for that meeting in such a way that we can hold it by way of a teleconference. But, if we have a teleconference, we cannot have a press conference. That, basically, is the follow-up. "
11/05/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was left at 3.75% and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were maintained at 4.75% and 2.75% respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. In March 2000 the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 - covering the period from January to March 2000 - rose to 6.0%, compared with 5.9% in the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Consequently, M3 growth remained 1 1/2 percentage points above the reference value of 4 1/2%. The annual rate of increase in credit to the private sector also rose, to 10.9%, compared with 10.4% in the previous month. These figures confirm our earlier assessment, namely that liquidity continued to be ample in the euro area in early 2000. As regards economic developments, recent information confirms the very positive outlook for strong growth in the euro area. All available indicators and forecasts seem to point to a phase of continued economic growth, following the upturn observed in the second half of 1999. Industrial production rebounded in February and this, together with further increases in capacity utilisation and industrial confidence up to April, suggests an ongoing strengthening in industrial activity. In addition, with consumer confidence remaining at an all-time high and unemployment continuing to decline, the recent strength of private consumption should be sustained. Looking at the world economy, the upturn in growth has become more broadly based, pertaining to both industrial and emerging economies, and most forecasts indicate that current growth differentials between economic areas are in the course of narrowing. Notwithstanding the strong growth performance and favourable outlook for euro area economic activity, the exchange rate of the euro has continued to decline over the past few weeks and has thereby moved further out of line with the increasingly positive economic fundamentals of the euro area, as well as international balance of payments positions. In March consumer price inflation, as measured by increases in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), rose to 2.1%, up from 2.0% in the previous month. This was due to developments in both oil prices and exchange rates. A moderation in 12-month inflation rates can be expected in the course of 2000, reflecting the decline in oil prices from around mid-March and base effects dampening the increase in inflation rates compared with the same month a year earlier. However, what matters for monetary policy are the trends underlying the outlook for price stability in the medium term. In this respect, the depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro, until it is reversed, will increase the risks to price stability in the medium term. These risks have to be taken seriously in the light of the current strong upswing. Other important factors which will have a crucial impact on the outlook for price stability over the medium term are a continuation of currently moderate wage developments, a further fiscal consolidation in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and the further implementation of structural reforms in product and labour markets. The Governing Council would like its message to be very clear: price stability in the euro area will be maintained and, as I already said last week, the citizens of Europe can be confident that their savings and pensions will keep their value over time. Price stability will help to turn the current upswing into a long period of high economic growth and falling unemployment, and it will strengthen the currency. Finally, I should like to inform you about two items related to the field of statistics. First, the Governing Council has decided in the near future to publish a comprehensive description of the statistical information collected and compiled by the ESCB, mainly in the areas of money and banking statistics, securities issues, interest rates, balance of payments and financial accounts, with pointers to possible developments in these areas. Second, the Governing Council has adopted a revised Guideline and a revised Recommendation on ""the statistical reporting requirements of the ECB in the field of balance of payments statistics, the international reserves template and international investment position statistics"". Both the Guideline and the Recommendation will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in due course. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. First of all, as far as structural reforms are concerned, almost day after day and press conference after press conference we urge the people, the social partners and governments of the euro area to continue to carry out and implement further structural reforms in the labour and product markets. And it is a process which is taking place - we do not deny that - but it should be persistent and should take place at a determined and hopefully faster pace than is currently the case. To the extent that it does not take place, it does have an impact on the views of the outside world vis-à-vis the euro area and, with that, on the exchange rate of the euro - there is no denying that. With regard to Japan, I would advise you to ask my Japanese colleagues that question. And as many things in Japan are difficult for us to understand, and even more difficult to explain, such is the case with the exchange rate of the Japanese yen. May I answer that question first? I have read those rumours, just as you have, and I am inclined to do the same as the markets are apparently doing, i.e. ""shrug them off"". I cannot tell you anything about the conversations I had with my US colleagues when I met them last weekend in Basel. I am not prepared to pursue that conversation further in public. The ECB has issued its ""Convergence Report"" on Greece and my colleague Mr. Noyer has presented it to the European Parliament. And that should say enough. That is the judgement that the ECB has given in advising the Council of Ministers on the state of convergence of the Greek economy in the light of the Greek request for entry into Monetary Union. And I really have nothing to add to what has been said in that Convergence Report. We have obviously not done so today and I will not exclude, as I have said before, the possibility of our switching to that technique at some time, some day. I do not know when. Why we have not done so today is due mainly to the fact that in the very volatile and virulent markets we are experiencing these days we did not want to instil a new element which would again increase uncertainty or volatility or virulence. So, let us remain calm. Interventions are always a possibility and the only time you will hear me speak about interventions, and the deliberations concerning them, will be at the time we intervene. And I will not comment on that issue at any other time, not even on whether discussions have taken place. Last question first: yes, I would deny that. They were not covert interventions. So the very last question I do not have to answer. Returning to the first question on the statements made by Mr. Fabius and Mr. Schröder, I have seen them. I have listened to them. But let me say that those statements were not unwelcome, nor were they welcome. I would advise you to listen only to me. I do not know. If these were - and they were - normal commercial transactions, then you should not expect anything from this phenomenon in coming weeks. First of all, I am not prepared to take any blame for the decline in the euro, although I realise that markets may do so. But I do not share that blame. And do we need an economic government? I think not. I think co-operation between the responsible euro area Ministers of Finance and Economics in the context of the Euro-11 and their continuing dialogue with the European Central Bank are a very acceptable, even agreeable, situation which does not, to my mind, point in the direction of institutional political developments which would be different from those in progress. I do not. Question (translation): Last Friday you said that you understood that the citizens of Europe were concerned about the weakness of the euro. People who read that text consider that you do not feel responsible for that. And there is internal stability. But do you think political factors within the European Union are responsible for this? And why do you not point the finger more clearly at what you consider to be political responsibilities? I did not wish to engage in a debate on the ""whys"" and ""ifs"" of the developments in the exchange rate. What I merely wished to do was to convey the feeling to the citizens of Europe that they should not be concerned about these exchange rate developments, as they increasingly tended to be in view of the value - the intrinsic value - of their money, the euro, and of the intrinsic value of their savings and pensions. Because we are achieving the main thing that we at the ECB have been hired for - it is to maintain price stability and to pass that price stability on to future generations, to people who are saving or building up a pension, and to their children. That is our main goal, and it is a goal which we are capable of achieving. Whom did I meet over the weekend? We had a regular meeting, as we have every month, of the G-10 central bank governors to which I am grateful to be invited as the 11th representative of the G-10. So, I met all the colleagues I meet every month, including the American ones. And these are Mr. Greenspan, Mr. McDonough, Mr. Hayami, Mr. Trichet, Mr. Welteke, Mr. Wellink ... And, to re-phrase your last question in a slightly less antagonistic way, we make every effort we can to let those ministers and ourselves, all governors, speak in a choir with one voice. And I think that Mr. Noyer did a great job in achieving just that last Monday when he was in Brussels attending the Euro-11 Ministers of Finance meeting, while I was attending the G-10 meeting in Basel. Mr. Noyer succeeded, as you will all have noticed, in getting the ministers to speak with one voice and not to point in different directions. Well, if the current exchange rate is compared with the exchange rate for the euro over the period - let us say - two years before the euro came into existence, a period in which growth forecasts, unemployment figures and inflation figures were far - I don't want to say ""worse"" - less good than at present, then the fact that the exchange rate has clearly fallen below that level for some time now indicates to me that it may well be that the markets have overshot the level which would be appropriate for an economy which has such a strong growth potential, which is actually realising that potential, which will realise a healthy balance of payments surplus for the foreseeable future and which is realising a climate of price stability - in terms of price increases in the foreseeable future, i.e. over the next two years - which will remain below the ceiling we have defined as the limit for acceptable price movements, namely 2%. It is good to see that you realise that there are differences between Tokyo and Frankfurt. But I would not be very consistent in my stance if I were to answer your question when I did not answer the first question which was put to me. No further comments on interventions. Well, the most important question, if I may call it that, is the first one, of course. There is no contradiction. But what has been happening over the last couple of weeks? Across Europe, people at large have become concerned about all they have read and heard about their having a weak currency. What I wished to convey to the public at large was that, if you talk about a currency and its weakness, you also have to look at, in technical terms, the internal value of the currency. And so, how can one call a currency which is characterised by stable prices a weak currency? I do not. It is only the external value which you refer to. But I wanted to impress on the people who were becoming concerned about the value of their property, their savings and their pensions that there was no danger at all. And, as long as the ECB is there - may I say, as long as I am there - there will be no danger. The second question is very simple to answer. We have models, we have good reasoning, so that we know what the proportion of imports in our GPD is euro area-wide. So we can calculate what impact a persistent exchange rate level, as compared with a previous period, will have on import prices. And that is, I must say, rather limited. That depends on how long it lasts. If it persists, it would add to inflation - a few decimals of a percentage point. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, the German stock exchange is now merging with the London stock exchange. Everything is now taking place in London, i.e. outside the euro area. Not only German shares, but also European shares, the whole euro capital market trade in euro, will take place in London. That is the way things look at the moment. Now, how do you feel about this? Are you happy with this? That is the first thing. And the second question is: has the European capital market not come to a halt, because international investors and US investors, if they buy shares in euro, want to have the same securities supervision and so on? First of all, I was not aware that the merger between the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges meant that everything would go through London. I thought not. And I think that the merger of the Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris stock exchanges will not mean that everything will go either to Amsterdam or to Brussels or to Paris. They will find a certain division of labour which, I think, is only healthy. And, as far as developments in the capital markets are concerned, there are only euro-denominated ""Wertpapiere"" (securities) available, as you said. What is true is that the unification of the market into one big European capital market is taking place at a slower pace than the unification at the short end of the market, in the money market. In the money market, we have seen, within days of the introduction of the euro, the development of one large European money market. In the capital market, there is still very different legislation governing the 11 participating countries - different traditions, different terms in which the contracts underlying an equity or bond are couched. That is still dividing the capital market up into segments, but there is development. It may take another decade before we can speak of one large European capital market. It will be denominated in euro, there is no doubt about that. It already is, but it will take time before the instruments traded in the capital market are completely comparable and tradable anywhere in Europe or anywhere in the world on the same footing. I am! Question (translation): Mr. Trichet has come under investigation in France for a very old case. Many people thought that this could challenge his future position as President of the European Central Bank. Do you feel that this is the case? Do you think that could challenge the compromise that was arrived at in May 1998 and, if there were to be a change, would that change your own personal plans? I will not, in any event, comment on my personal plans or on the position of President of the ECB, as I had promised the press that I would not do so at any time in the future. So, I will not do that. As far as Mr. Trichet is concerned, I will simply say: at the time when the judicial investigation started and was made public, the Comité Monétaire in France published a communiqué of three lines, stating that it continued to fully support and have confidence in Governor Trichet as the Chairman of the Committee. If they had asked me to do so, I would have joined them in that communiqué. This is almost too complicated for me. We are concerned, but may I ask Mr. Noyer to express our concern Noyer: We are, in fact, concerned - not about a certain level, but about certain developments which have occurred and about the fact that there may be fewer automatic stabilisers in that respect than may have existed in various financial centres before. We have studied this quite extensively. We have studied a number of tools that could permit us to rule out any excessive developments in the same direction. The work is not yet fully finalised. But the question was: ""are you concerned"" and ""can you do something about it?"" Yes, we are concerned. We are monitoring the situation very closely and we are developing tools that could be used in due course, if necessary. None whatsoever. I tell you what's going on. Somewhere I have said that we are remaining very vigilant. That is what is going on. "
13/04/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council today conducted its regular examination of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area. Following this review, the Governing Council decided to maintain the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem at 3.5% and to keep the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and on the deposit facility at 4.5% and 2.5% respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. Let me start with information in relation to the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy. No new monetary data have been released since the last meeting of the Governing Council, which was held in Madrid on 30 March 2000. The annual growth rate of M3 in February 2000 was 6.2%. This implied a small increase in the three-month moving average of annual M3 growth, to 5.9%, from 5.8% recorded for the three-month period from November 1999 to January 2000. M3 growth thus remained around 1 1/2 percentage points above the reference value of 4 1/2%. The picture of generous liquidity conditions in the euro area is also confirmed by the continued strong annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector, which stood at 10.5% in February. With regard to economic developments in the euro area, following strong growth of real GDP in the second half of 1999, most recent production and survey data suggest that the economic expansion also remained strong in early 2000. In particular, both consumer and industrial confidence have now reached levels which are close to the highest observed since the mid-1980s. This picture of strong growth of domestic demand supports the favourable outlook for economic growth in the euro area as depicted in recent forecasts. The positive prospects for euro area activity also benefit from the strong cyclical upswing in the world economy, which has become more broadly based across industrial and emerging economies and which is expected to continue in the years to come. The exchange rate of the euro does not reflect the ongoing improvement in domestic fundamentals in the euro area economy. In nominal effective terms, the euro was around 4% lower in mid-April than at the beginning of the year and approximately 14% below its level in the first quarter of last year. Until reversed, this development will put upward pressure on import prices and will continue to affect the risks for price stability in the euro area. As I have already noted on previous occasions, the rise in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) which we have observed over recent months stems, to a large extent, from the combined effects of both oil price and exchange rate developments. The annual rate of change in the HICP rose to 2.0% in February 2000, from 1.9% in the previous month. The rate of inflation on producer prices also rose further in February 2000, mainly in connection with rising prices for intermediate goods. In the course of the past few weeks oil prices have declined. This has been in line with the assumption underlying currently available economic forecasts, namely that the oil price increases which we observed until March will partially unwind in the course of the year. At the same time, it is most likely that the complete upward impact on consumer prices via import and producer prices of the oil price and exchange rate developments in recent months has not yet materialised. Against this background, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the figure for annual HICP inflation will slightly exceed 2% in the spring of this year, before falling back to lower levels. What matters for monetary policy, however, are the trends underlying the outlook for price stability in the medium term. In this context, the Governing Council again stressed the need for the continuation of wage moderation in the euro area. As noted earlier, monetary and credit developments confirm that liquidity in the euro area is ample. Developments in the exchange rate of the euro also remain a cause for concern with regard to future price stability. In the light of the favourable prospects for strong economic growth, the impact of these developments on inflationary pressures will need to be monitored closely. The Eurosystem will remain vigilant in assessing upside risks to price stability and will take appropriate action if and when required. A forward-looking monetary policy which responds to risks to price stability before they materialise will avoid the need for a costly stabilisation of inflation at a later stage. Such a forward-looking approach is clearly also the best contribution monetary policy can make to ensuring the sustainability of the process of economic growth. This phase of economic growth in the euro area will offer a great opportunity to make further progress in bringing down the high level of unemployment in the euro area. An important means of achieving this will be continued wage moderation, which, in turn, will also help to contain inflationary pressure. This notwithstanding, as I have stressed repeatedly in the past, the key to achieving a sustainable reduction in the level of unemployment will be structural reforms in the euro area, including a lowering of the tax burden and an improvement in the fiscal expenditure structure. Only when labour markets are more flexible and competitive pressures are high will it be possible to prevent bottlenecks from triggering upward pressures on prices at a relatively early stage of an economic recovery. Fiscal policy has to play its part in this context. The favourable economic prospects will lead to higher tax revenues. In line with the Stability and Growth Pact, it is not opportune to use these extra revenues for higher spending. Now is the time to speed up fiscal consolidation in order to help to reduce further the debt-to-GDP ratios in the Community and to approach more quickly fiscal budgetary positions in surplus or balance. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to present some of the additional topics discussed today by the Governing Council. I should like to draw your attention to two items: the first reflects the Eurosystem's growing involvement in the EU accession process and relates to the Governing Council's position with regard to the appropriateness of euro-based currency board arrangements (CBAs) as a strategy to be used by accession countries with regard to adopting the euro; the second relates to a further enhancement of the ECB's transparency policy. Let me start with the Governing Council's deliberations on CBAs. We concluded that the appropriateness of CBAs will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the Governing Council neither encourages nor discourages the adoption of euro-based CBAs. In any event, such arrangements cannot be regarded as a substitute for two years' participation in ERM II. Accession countries which have operated a euro-based CBA deemed to be sustainable might not be required to go through a double regime shift in their strategies to adopt the euro. Thus such countries may participate in ERM II with a CBA as a unilateral commitment augmenting the discipline within ERM II. However, it should be clearly understood that a common accord would have to be reached on the central parity against the euro. With a view to further enhancing the ECB's transparency policy, the Governing Council has today decided to publish all non-confidential legal instruments governing the relationship between the ECB and the euro area national central banks in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The release of these legal instruments in all 11 official Community languages will give interested members of the public an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge about the internal operation of the Eurosystem. The members of the Governing Council regard the transparency of the decision-making process as an appropriate means by which to strengthen the democratic nature of the institution and to increase the public's confidence in its administration. This decision is in line with the general policy towards increased transparency in the decision-making process currently being pursued at the Community level. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Let me answer the last question first. We are, generally speaking, not worried about divergencies within the euro area. They are normal and natural. The wage negotiations are still going on in full force. We have only incidental or anecdotal information on the outcome of wage negotiations in the various parts of the European Union. And they sometimes diverge. There are some encouraging signs, particularly here in Germany. There are also signs which give more cause for concern in other areas of the European economy. So, the process is still going on, but - as I said in my Introductory Statement - we cannot stop emphasising the high importance of moderate wage settlements, in the interests of the all-encompassing fight against unemployment. Noyer: Well, the answer is: no, we have not discussed that. But perhaps the President would like to add something. We have not discussed it today, but we have discussed it many times before. And we do not see the need for institutional changes in the organisation of the European System of Central Banks, including the ECB. If you would allow me to answer the first one first. I happen, by chance, to have read what was published in the Dutch newspapers. I would like to emphasise that, in the process of accession, you have to clearly distinguish between, I would say, three phases. First, there is the accession to the European Union. Second, sometimes years later, there will be the required entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. And, third, again years later, there will be the possibility - provided all the convergence criteria, both quantitative and qualitative, have been met - of entry into Monetary Union and also of adopting the euro as their currency. So, all in all, we are talking about a process - I do not want to give the idea that we have a precise figure in mind - but we are talking about a process which, to my mind, will take at least a decade to be fully completed. Well, I do not have figures on that, but let me give some consolation or some confidence to those outside the euro area who hold private reserves in Deutsche Mark. The fact is that about 30% of the Deutsche Mark in circulation is supposed to be circulating outside Germany. Of that 30% most is circulating in central and eastern Europe. They will have to be swapped for euro banknotes as from 1 January 2002. They will not lose their value for a long time after that. There will be a long period after that in which they can still be exchanged for euro banknotes, but only at the central bank, and no longer in the private sector. So, the exchange with banks in the private sector will be possible for a period of approximately one to two months. Those who are still sitting on German banknotes after that will have to go to the central bank if they want to get rid of them, and change them. And this may take a period - well it differs from country to country - of, say, up to 30 years. Well, I have not read the statement, so I cannot say that I have understood it. But, because it was the Vice-President who said it, I will ask the Vice-President to answer. Noyer: I have not read it either, but - as you report it to us - I can hardly understand it. I think this is a completely different topic. I cannot understand the relationship you mention. I could not agree more. No, it is true and, if I may take this opportunity, what you are referring to is the recently published World Economic Outlook of the IMF in which it was said - as far as monetary policy in Europe is concerned - that, admittedly, monetary conditions were ample, but - given the economic situation and the likely development of inflation - there seemed to be no need to tighten monetary policy. Let me simply say that we, the Governing Council, do not agree with that assessment. Well, if that suspicion is there, it is unfounded. At the G7 table the euro will undoubtedly be one of the topics for discussion, and so will the yen and the US dollar. What I am going to say there is that, indeed, as I have just said in my Introductory Statement, the continuous - let me call it - depressed level of the euro exchange rate puzzles us. It will have an impact if it perseveres, but we are not sure that it will and we do not expect it to persevere. If it perseveres, it will have an impact on inflationary developments in the euro area and, in that way, it will be one of the factors we will be taking into account in future monetary policy decisions. As far as the forecasts that have recently been published by the European Commission are concerned, our analysis has led us to the conclusion that - in general terms - we concur with the contents of the forecasts. We are not entirely sure which hypotheses underlie these forecasts. Let me put it this way: we share the optimism on economic growth, as it has been expressed by the Commission, in that we also believe that growth in 2000 and 2001 will be well in excess of 3%. Whether the high figures that the Commission quotes will materialise gives us some reason for hesitation or doubt. As far as the inflation forecasts are concerned, however, where the Commission expects inflation to average out at 1.8% in 2000 and 2001, we have - as I have just said in my Introductory Statement - now reached a level of 2%. We will not be surprised - on the contrary, to the extent that oil price and exchange rate developments work their way through in the coming months, we do expect, for a brief period in the coming months, that the figure might even slightly exceed that of 2%, before dropping back to 2% or less, so that, on average, we are somewhat less comfortable than the Commission seems to feel. I will not put it in precise figures, but we regard both the growth forecasts and the inflation forecast of the Commission as being on the optimistic side from an economic point of view. The difference is not very large, but ... let me leave it at that judgement. That is correct. Well, apparently it was not. For that - in our assessment - you also have to remember that it was only four weeks ago that we raised interest rates by one quarter of a percent. And that was only four weeks after we had raised interest rates in February. To do so now would not create the impression of a very calm, stable and forward-looking policy. On the other hand, all the indications we have given - and I will repeat them again today - are such that I believe that there cannot be any doubt in anybody's mind as to the direction in which the next move will go. But timing is important. Direction is of course important. Magnitude is important. We discussed everything, but we did not come to a decision. All forecasts that I am aware of indicate that in the course of this two-year period and, most likely, towards the end of this year or early next year - which is later than expected earlier, I admit - the euro area growth performance will overtake this still remarkably good growth performance of the United States. So, that is linked to the timing of the reversal of exchange rate movements which we expect to happen with virtual certainty. But I am not a prophet and I cannot predict precisely when. If I could, I would not tell you. If I knew, I would be rich. It is a small question which would require a big answer - which I am not in a position to give. But there are encouraging signs of a recovery of the Japanese economy finally taking hold after so many years of hesitation. The signs are encouraging. And the words of Governor Hayami, as I know them, and he will undoubtedly repeat them the day after tomorrow at the G7 meeting, I can fully understand and support. First, on the structure of the organisation and the institutional process: I am not aware of what was discussed because I was not there. I do not know whether, and if, the French and German Governments have discussed this matter. All I can say is that the Governing Council of the ECB, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference which is currently in progress and which has to be concluded by the end of this year, sees no need to change the decision-making structures of the various bodies of the European System of Central Banks. So we will not take any initiative to that effect. And I doubt whether anybody else would take an initiative to that effect. Well, the second part of your question was on structural reforms. We do see signs of structural reforms in various parts of Economic and Monetary Union. But, then, one has to remember that the structural reforms necessary in the labour markets, in the product markets, in the goods and services markets, in government finance, in social security systems, may - and do - differ from country to country, and from region to region. So, it is not easy, it is even impossible to make a general statement about how these structural reforms are proceeding, but our constant and consistent hammering on the need for structural reforms, the need for greater flexibility in the markets, in particular the labour markets, will continue - from press conference to press conference and from Monthly Bulletin to Monthly Bulletin. And, I did so again today, because it is so necessary. But this should not create the impression that nothing is happening anywhere. Many things are happening, but sometimes at a very slow and - occasionally - at an even disappointingly slow pace. It does not imply that. I can repeat it again: the position, the level of the euro, as it has now been for a rather prolonged period, is a position, which - over time - contributes to the upward risks to price stability. And it is that factor - if those upward risks become stronger or if they do not abate - that would induce monetary policy reactions, not the exchange rate as such. The exchange rate as such is not our target. Well, they contribute to the upward risks to price stability, together with the prolonged period of high oil prices. And it is all these factors, together with a few others, which will ultimately lead to a conclusion. I promised it this year. So I will not bring it forward to the spring. And I hope to keep my promise that it will be this year. As to the precise form, we are still considering it. It is very important - the form and the degree of detail it will include. And, whenever we come to the publication of forecasts, we do want to supplement it with, you might say, an educational explanation of what forecasts mean and what they can be used for, making clear that they are certainly not the only determinant underlying certain decisions to be taken. We therefore want to apply the laws of relativity also to the publishing of forecasts. "
30/03/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, today, the Governing Council of the ECB met for the first time outside Frankfurt. Therefore, let me first of all thank our host, Governor Rojo, for inviting us to meet in Madrid and for the generous hospitality offered to us. The Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. I should like to take the opportunity of this special meeting to take stock of where we stand 15 months after the start of Monetary Union. In January 1999 the euro was successfully launched as the single currency for 11 Member States of the EU. As a result of very careful conceptual and technical preparations, both the monetary policy-making process and the implementation of monetary policy have functioned efficiently right from the start. The challenges involved in setting up a central bank for a currency area as large as the euro area have been enormous. The Eurosystem - which comprises the European Central Bank and the 11 national central banks of the countries which have adopted the euro - has met these challenges with success. This would not have been possible without a strong willingness to co-operate on the part of the actors involved. I should like to take this opportunity once again to thank all the members of the Governing Council and the staff of the Eurosystem for this. From the start, we had extremely productive and open discussions in the Governing Council on monetary policy issues. In this respect, our monetary policy strategy has provided a very useful framework within which to organise our thinking. In our discussions there has always been a clear understanding, based on the Treaty, that the single monetary policy can only focus on maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. This is based on the simple fact that in a monetary union, there is only one monetary policy, and this must be directed to a single objective. As laid down in the Treaty, each member of the Governing Council is therefore well aware that he or she is not a representative of a country or central bank but acts in a personal capacity in deciding the appropriate conduct of monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. The move to the single currency and the introduction of the euro were based on a degree of convergence towards price stability in participating countries that few observers would have predicted some years ago. In 1999 the average rate of consumer price increases in the euro area as a whole was among the lowest recorded since the Second World War and, at 1.1%, remained fully consistent with price stability. At the same time, Monetary Union does not mean perfect identity of economic conditions in all parts of the euro area. The experience of all larger currency areas shows that some differences in regional price developments and also in regional output growth may exist. As differences in national or regional developments cannot be addressed by the Eurosystem, they require, whenever necessary, country-specific responses. This means, in particular, responsible national wage settlements and appropriate national fiscal policies aimed at counteracting specific national problems. In addition, reforms addressing rigidities in labour and product markets and aiming at enhancing labour and capital mobility are the tools to ensure that market mechanisms will play an increasingly important role in limiting the scope for divergent developments in the euro area. The single monetary policy offers a great opportunity to maintain price stability in the euro area and to create the conditions needed for sustained economic growth. Currently, the prospects for strong economic growth in the euro area are very favourable - indeed, more favourable than they have been for many years. Economic activity in the euro area strengthened markedly in the second half of 1999 and this upswing is expected to continue through 2000 and beyond. Available forecasts point to real GDP growth of slightly over 3% in 2000 and 2001, reflecting both the favourable external environment and strong domestic demand. In line with this positive outlook, employment is expected to increase further and unemployment to come down in this context. At this juncture, it remains, indeed, important that the expected improvements in economic conditions and labour market prospects are not jeopardised by inappropriate wage settlements. In fact, wage moderation, combined with structural reforms in the labour markets, would help both to contain inflation in the euro area and to lead to further progress with employment creation. The contribution of monetary policy to strong and sustained economic growth is to ensure that price stability in the euro area will be maintained in the years to come. The Governing Council has, over recent months, raised ECB interest rates in three steps, in total by 1 percentage point, as a response to signals from both pillars of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy that upward risks to price stability were increasing. Since the last meeting of the Governing Council, which was held on 16 March 2000, the main new data released relate to monetary developments and HICP inflation in the euro area. With regard to monetary developments, the annual growth rate of M3 in February 2000 was 6.2%, implying a small increase in the three-month moving average of annual M3 growth, to 5.9% for the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The annual rate of change in the HICP in the euro area rose from 1.9% in January 2000 to 2.0% in February 2000, reflecting the anticipated upward pressure on consumer prices stemming from oil price and exchange rate developments. In its review of the economic and monetary situation, the Governing Council also considered the recent developments in the exchange rate of the euro. Such developments need to be carefully assessed in the framework of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council regards the present level of the euro as not reflecting the significant recent improvements in the outlook for the euro area economy. At today's meeting the Governing Council decided to leave ECB interest rates unchanged. We shall, however, continue to be vigilant in order to be in a position, if needed, to counter inflationary pressure in a timely manner. There remain, however, also challenges for other economic policies in the euro area. As regards fiscal policies, the current upswing provides, for many countries, a good opportunity to comply more quickly with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact. This will free up resources for private initiatives and will, over time, contribute to increasing the growth potential of the euro area. At this juncture, probably the greatest challenge for the euro area lies in speeding up structural reform in order to reduce the high level of structural unemployment. In this respect, the Eurosystem strongly supports the conclusions of the European Council in Lisbon and calls for their timely implementation. Furthering structural reform is the key to a lasting process of job creation and a sustained period of strong economic expansion. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to present some of the additional topics discussed today by the Governing Council. I should like to draw your attention to the following two items: first, the international financial architecture, an issue which was discussed in preparation for the forthcoming IMF Spring Meetings in Washington, D.C., and, second, the ECB's information campaign for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. Let me start with the Governing Council's deliberations in relation to the current discussion on the international financial architecture, for which the President was mandated to convey the Governing Council's views to the President of the ECOFIN Council. Through its representation in all-relevant international institutions and fora, the Eurosystem has been able to participate actively in ongoing discussions over the past year. The Eurosystem actively supports those efforts made by various institutions and fora - such as the IMF, the World Bank, the Financial Stability Forum and the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision - to enhance transparency and to improve the soundness both of financial systems and of regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Owing to the fact that unsustainable exchange rate regimes were a factor behind financial crises of previous years, recent discussions have focused in particular on the choice of appropriate exchange rate arrangements. The Governing Council is of the view that such a choice should not be confined to alternative solutions of either a hard peg or free floating. Intermediate regimes, such as adjustable pegs, may suit the needs of emerging market economies, depending on their specific domestic and external conditions. Refocusing the role of the IMF has been central to most recent reform proposals. The Governing Council is of the view that strengthening the key responsibilities of the IMF, namely further enhancing its credibility as a policy adviser and provider of financial assistance to members facing a loss of market confidence, will make an important contribution to international monetary stability. As regards crisis management, the Eurosystem is looking forward to seeing further progress in the complex but crucial area of ensuring private sector involvement in crisis prevention and resolution. Second, the Governing Council approved the overall framework for the EURO 2002 information campaign - a Europe-wide campaign intended to familiarise citizens with the euro banknotes and coins. The main objectives of the campaign are to help citizens: to recognise the euro banknotes and coins and, in particular, their security features, to familiarise themselves with the different (and, in many cases, new) denominations of the euro banknotes and coins, and to inform themselves about the means by which the euro banknotes and coins will be introduced on 1 January 2002. The strategy behind the ECB's campaign is based on the concept of co-operation with ""multipliers"", such as banks, retailers and their associations, as well as educational institutions and governmental authorities, at both a European and a national level. The campaign will be conducted in two main phases. In the first phase, which is about to start, the ""multipliers"" will be approached in order to prepare their own activities with regard to training and the provision of information. In the second phase, scheduled for the second half of 2001, the general public will actively be informed by means of a centralised mass media campaign to ensure the smooth changeover to the euro banknotes and coins. The main communication tools will be television spots and widely distributed printed matter supported by radio spots and both billboard and press advertisements. I should like to stress that due account will be taken of the specific needs of the various groups of vulnerable citizens in the conduct of the campaign. Close co-ordination with the EU institutions and the Member States will ensure the provision of consistent information. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Question (translation): Two questions, please. First, one on your communications policy - not with regard to financial markets, which has already been criticised, and I do not wish to come back to that - but with regard to public opinion. Do you think that two meetings a year in two different capitals will be enough for the public to feel that Frankfurt, and the ECB, is closer to them? The second on your monetary policy: on 16 March you raised your interest rates and, since then, we have seen oil prices falling again and wage moderation being respected, at least in Germany. Do you think you panicked too early? We do think that, for the time being, two meetings per year are enough. We also want to avoid European citizens feeling that nobody knows where the European Central Bank is. So we should not be away from our headquarters too often. Indeed, since our last meeting in March, oil prices have not increased further. It is too early to judge what the near future will bring. It is not too early to judge what past developments still have to bring. The increases in oil prices are still working their way through, and will continue to work their way through in the price developments for some months to come. And the same holds true of the exchange rate. It has hardly moved since our last interest rate decision in March. But it is also true to say that it has not yet moved upwards. So, it remains at a level which increases the upward pressure on prices. So, we do not by any means think that we have been premature. On the contrary, as I said in my introductory statement, we remain vigilant as to future developments in an environment of robust economic growth, which we expect to continue throughout this year and next year. And thereafter? It is too early to say what will happen. So, coming back to your question, we think that the latest figures, which have been released since we took our last interest rate step, more or less justify ex post the action we took on 16 March. I am not that much of an expert in snails, except in eating them. But that is not relevant at this point. So I cannot tell you anything about the speed, or the scope, with which the snail is creeping or moving. But I think the fact that I said that the Governing Council will remain vigilant in the light of both the euro area's robust economic growth and the developments that still have to work their way through should be enough for an indication of the direction in which the snail is creeping. With regard to the recent OPEC decision, as I said earlier, it is still too early to judge what the effect will be in the longer term. Normally, increases in oil prices work their way through to the consumer price index with a lag of between four and six months. So, with a view to the decision taken only a few days ago, the effects of which on the market price are not yet quite clear, it is far too early to say anything about its impact in the longer term. This is true especially for us, since we take a medium-term perspective of at least one and a half or two years on inflationary developments. With regard to the exchange rate: as I have said, the exchange rate has not moved very much since our last meeting, but it has stayed around the level already reached two or four or even six weeks ago, which is a level that the Governing Council firmly believes does not adequately reflects the potential for growth and the current situation of robust economic growth with unemployment slowly falling in the euro area. So, it is still too early to judge - again, at that moment - how the impact of these developments will be reflected in the exchange rate. Well, first of all, we are not joining investment banks in speculating on what either stock prices or interest rates will be doing in the near future. And I would like to point out - point to the fact - that, if you look at the United States, for example, substantially higher interest rates did not prevent stock prices from increasing last year. I think the Irish Finance Minister cannot say anything but what he said. A fact is, of course, that differentials in price increases across a large currency area are not abnormal. In a study we have recently published in our ECB Monthly Bulletin, we came to the conclusion that differentials in the euro area were, to our own surprise, even smaller than the differentials you see between some 25 cities in the United States. Still, I do maintain that the problem Ireland faces in having a substantially higher rate of inflation than the euro area-wide rate of inflation is a problem that has to be addressed. It will be addressed, I am sure, by the Irish Government, and by the Irish Government alone. Question (translation): This is another question for you, sir - more or less along the lines of the last one. You said in your introductory remarks that the countries with a higher inflation rate within the euro area should have their own special monetary policies as well as structural reforms. Now, since in Spain we have a high rate of inflation of 3%, do you think that the current policies are the right ones for Spain? Sorry, I did not say that they should have their own monetary policy. You see, we have only one monetary policy in the euro area. But they have their own fiscal policies and wage policies as well as structural reform policies, and those are policy areas which have to be addressed by the national governments, and by the social partners, I am inclined to say. But the European Central Bank and all of the Eurosystem can and will do nothing about that. Well, I can only repeat what I said in my Introductory Statement. We certainly welcome the intentions implied in the Conclusions of the Lisbon Summit. What we have said, in addition, today, as the Governing Council, is that we hope that these Conclusions will be implemented in practice, sooner rather than later. And that they will not be words only. Question (translation): I would really like to talk about the stock markets. Not that I expect you to give me a forecast, nor to talk about the latest stock market developments. Rather, as seen in the last ECB Monthly Bulletin, on page 41, I would like to know whether the Governing Council has anything to say about the high volatility on the stock markets and, in particular, the high volatility of technology assets and utilities? The Council has not considered specific sectors of the stock market. The Council has briefly discussed the phenomenon of asset price volatility and the fact that we are extremely hesitant, or reluctant, to pass any judgement or normative judgement on these developments. And I will refrain from doing so here. Question (translation): I have three questions, but, of course, they are interrelated. The first question is this: Spain, Italy and so on used to have major reserves in foreign currency in their national central banks, especially as far as Deutsche Mark and Dutch guilder were concerned. But obviously, it does not make any sense to keep these anymore. When were they changed and how were they changed? Can you tell us? The other question is: the other national central banks around the world currently hold a certain percentage of their foreign exchange reserves in euro. To what extent do you think this percentage will increase in the next five years? And what do you say about profits? The Federal Republic of Germany used to receive profits from the Deutsche Bundesbank. How do you think this will increase, for example, for Germany or for the Spanish central bank in the next, say, five years? Where have the banknotes gone which used to be held by other euro area central banks? I suppose they have gone back to their home country in the meantime. And what will happen to the profits? I cannot say. We do not know how profits will develop. What we do know is that in the Eurosystem we have agreed on accounting rules which, over time, will substantially change annual developments in profits, and that, for example, we now include unrealised valuation losses in foreign exchange reserves directly in the profit and loss account, whereas in the past it was usually written off against some valuation reserve in the balance sheet of the banks. As far as the euro's share in foreign exchange reserves in the world outside the euro area is concerned, I expect it to develop over time. But, of course, you have to realise that we have been exposed to a certain shock as a result of the creation of the euro area itself. Before the introduction of the euro, the distribution of world reserves over various currencies was - and I am giving very rough figures now - about 60% US dollars, about something like 25% Deutsche Mark and around 5% Japanese yen, with the remaining 10% being shared by a variety of currencies, including Swiss francs, French francs, Dutch guilders and special drawing rights of the IMF. With the transition to the euro, the reserves of the euro area countries were, in some instances, held in US dollars and Deutsche Mark - in my own country, the Netherlands, for example, we held 50% of the foreign reserves in US dollars, 50% in Deutsche Mark. And overnight, the 50% Deutsche Mark had become domestic assets rather than foreign assets. So that phenomenon caused an immediate change in the world currency distribution of reserves. Because of the falling-out of the intra-euro area holdings of European currency reserves, it caused the euro share of international reserves to fall immediately. And now it is growing again. So, we are now in a situation where between 70 and 80% of the world reserves are held in US dollars and around 15 to 20% in euro. I expect the same trend to develop that we have observed over the past 25 years, namely a gradual decline in the share of the US dollar and a gradual increase in the share of the euro. I expect that trend to continue. But it is a long-term process. Question (translation): For the first time this year, the major economic blocs may grow strongly. We have remarkable economic developments in the United States, in the euro area, and also in South-East Asia as well as in the United Kingdom. Do you think the increase in interest rates will undermine this positive development? I do not think anything of the sort. We have a situation where, in Europe, growth is now expected to be over 3% this year and next year. For the United Kingdom, expectations are similar. It is true to say - amazingly, I must say, basically, also for the US authorities - that the US economy seems to be continuing to grow at a pace which - we thought earlier - might be similar to that in Europe. We now think it may even continue to be somewhat higher than in Europe. In Japan, we still do not know. We see a hesitant, shaky recovery. Now, all these developments, with the exception of the shakiness of Japan, present a very favourable picture, underpinning the chances for Europe, indeed, to experience robust economic growth and a fall in unemployment over the years to come. That fall in unemployment will only be of a significant nature if, at the same time, this period of increasing wealth and output growth is used also to execute the badly needed reforms in the various markets, in the labour markets, in particular, but also in the goods and services markets. The January figure, as you know, was strongly affected by base effects. The February figure was still affected to some extent. The figure of 6.2% which I mentioned was, to some extent, also still affected by base effects, i.e. by the fact that February's figure last year fell out of the series. But it also reflected fairly strong further increases in the various components of M3, leading us to the conclusion that we can still speak of a very accommodative monetary policy stance. And this is one of the factors which keeps us saying: ""we will remain vigilant"". One percentage point, you mean. With regard to the euro itself, we would only do something about it if it were to undermine our monetary policy strategy. And you, of course, are very much aware of that. I do not think that we can do very much else. And, with regard to the Lisbon Summit, I am sorry, I only can repeat that the message from Lisbon was strong enough: we, the Heads of State and Government, want unemployment to have virtually disappeared by the year 2010. We want to have full employment and we want to have ample room for information and communications technology to work its way through into our European economies. We, the Governing Council, fully endorse those Conclusions. The only thing we added was that we do hope that, sooner rather than later, words will be translated into deeds. Question (translation):Do you think that the European Central Bank should speak with one single voice? Well, today it looks as if it does. And I would hope that it will continue to be the case - even if it is not only my voice - it should be one sound, at least. Question (translation): We are in Madrid: should we see this first visit of the ECB to one of the euro area countries as a sign of encouragement or as a particular sign for the Spanish Prime Minister, a European conservative, who was recently re-elected in a rather social-democratic Europe. And a related question: could you give us your precise position regarding the latest budget measures of the French Government? On the last question: the answer is ""no, not specifically"". We pass judgement on budgetary developments in individual countries in the context of the discussion, together with the European Commission, in the Economic and Financial Committee and, openly, in the Euro-11. What we do think is that - I want to repeat what I said earlier - the period ahead of us gives all governments, and I am inclined to say the French Government is certainly included, a golden opportunity to speed ahead, faster than anticipated, towards fulfilling the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Now, why do we meet in Spain? The reason why has already been explained by Governor Rojo in his introductory remarks. Why do we want to meet outside Frankfurt every now and then? The question ""why did you start in Spain"" has been raised very often. The answer is very simple: we normally meet in Germany, in ""Deutschland"", and we wanted to give all Member States an opportunity to have a meeting on their soil in the coming years. And back to Germany, the last one in the series. So, we started with the first country in the alphabet that comes after ""Deutschland"", namely ""España"". I am very happy that the question was put both to Mr. Noyer and to me, ... because I do not know. Noyer: Could I say the same? With one voice? I am certain that it was not our advice. But I can only say that we are pleased with the outcome of those wage settlements, when we compare them with the original demands posted. And they do seem to indicate that the social partners, in Germany, too, have taken their responsibility for their future, and for their country, very, very seriously. We do not know yet. As I said earlier, it still all has to work its way through, and wage bargaining processes are still very much under way in many parts of the euro area. But, it certainly helps us in our fight against inflation. However, the pressures, the upward pressures, are still there. And that is the reason why I cannot but repeat myself even more often than I already have: we remain vigilant. But let me say: at least, these wage settlements have not added to our concern. "
02/03/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of the outlook for price developments in the euro area. After reviewing the evidence available from both the first and the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, the Governing Council decided to maintain the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem at 3.25% and the interest rate on the marginal lending facility and that on the deposit facility at 4.25% and 2.25% respectively, i.e. at the levels determined a month ago. The Governing Council also concluded that the balance of risks to price stability in the medium term remains on the upside. These upside risks will need to be monitored and assessed continuously in order to ensure that timely action can be taken, if and when required. The main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments are as follows. Starting with the monetary indicators covered under the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 for the period from November 1999 to January 2000 was 5.7%, compared with 6.0% in the last quarter of 1999. The reduction was determined by a base effect, since the monthly increase in M3 in January 1999 was exceptionally strong, reflecting the special environment at the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. At the same time, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector remained high, at 9.5% in January 2000. Overall, the prolonged deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4½%, especially when seen in conjunction with the dynamic growth of credit, indicates that liquidity conditions in the euro area remain generous. With regard to the second pillar, as usual, the Governing Council examined a broad range of indicators. Starting with long-term nominal interest rates, there was little change in the course of February. The yield curve remained relatively steep, thus indicating expectations of strong economic growth in the period ahead. Such expectations are partly based on the favourable outlook for the world economy. A key element underlying this positive outlook is the fact that the US economy is continuing to grow at a high rate, but the strong recovery and the acceleration of growth in other areas also support this view. The strongest level of performance is currently being recorded in emerging market economies in South-East Asia, while the broad outlook in Japan remains uncertain. There is also further evidence that economic activity in the euro area continued to expand strongly after the third quarter of last year. While euro area estimates for the fourth quarter of 1999 are not yet available, data for individual Member States point to continued robust output growth. In addition, area-wide industrial confidence increased further around the turn of the year and consumer confidence remained at the high level reached in the last two months of 1999. The cyclical upswing should extend well into 2000 and continue thereafter. This is also confirmed by available forecasts, which point to real GDP growth of slightly over 3% in 2000. As for 2001, the economic expansion in the euro area is generally expected to continue at a similar pace. Developments in the exchange rate of the euro, which do not reflect the underlying strength of the euro area economy, remain a cause for concern. Their upward impact on import prices is having a negative effect on the price climate and is thereby increasing the risks to price stability in the medium term. With regard to most recent developments in consumer price inflation, as measured by annual increases in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the upward movement has continued. In January 2000 the annual rate of HICP inflation was 2.0%, up from 1.7% in December 1999. As in earlier months, the latest upward movement is the result of the increase in energy prices, which, on an annual basis, reached 12.0% in January. Excluding the more volatile components, namely energy and seasonal food, HICP inflation in January increased slightly to 1.1% on account of somewhat higher price increases for non-energy industrial goods. While it is likely that annual inflation rates will fall again in the course of 2000, owing to base effects related to the price of oil, monetary policy-makers need to look beyond developments over the next few months, i.e. policy will need to focus on the risks to price stability in the medium term. Indeed, whereas most forecasts still point to average inflation of below 2% in 2000 and 2001, they are based on rather favourable assumptions and generally seem to imply a pattern which is characterised first by decreasing rates of inflation in the course of this year and then by more fundamental upward tendencies later on. Against this background, the Governing Council concluded that vigilance is required and pointed to several factors. First, developments in monetary and credit aggregates will need to be analysed continuously in order to assess upward risks to price stability. Second, in view of the improving economic conditions, the potential spillover of large and protracted increases in import and producer prices into consumer prices will need to be assessed carefully. In this context, developments in the exchange rate and in oil prices will play a major role. It will be essential, both for maintaining price stability and for reducing the high level of unemployment, that wage settlements remain moderate and do not themselves contribute to inflation expectations, which would also endanger the sustainability of the current upswing. Fiscal policies can make a substantive contribution to maintaining favourable economic conditions by using the current upswing as an excellent opportunity to proceed swiftly towards fulfilling the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact. Economic conditions and perspectives in the euro area appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade. Growth is strong, employment is expected to increase further and the still very high level of unemployment should continue to fall. Remaining vigilant to counter upside risks to price stability and pursuing structural reform is the foundation for a sustained period of strong economic growth and a lasting process of job creation. Finally, I should like to draw your attention to two items not directly linked to today's meeting of the Governing Council. First, I should like to inform you that on 30 March 2000 the Governing Council will meet for the first time outside Frankfurt, namely in Madrid. The meeting will be followed by a press conference. It is our intention that Governing Council meetings will be held in other euro area Member States twice a year. In the second half of this year it is envisaged that the Governing Council will meet in Paris. Second, on 2 and 3 November 2000 the ECB will hold its first Central Banking Conference. The topic of the conference will be ""Why price stability?"" and it will take place in Frankfurt. The ECB's Central Banking Conference, which will be organised biennially, will bring together invited participants from central banks, international and European institutions, academia and the press. As of today, regularly updated information, including a preliminary programme, will be provided on the ECB's Web site. The final programme for the conference and all the papers, comments and a summary of the discussions will be made available on the ECB's Web site in due course. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Well, let me say this: on the basis of the statement I have just made, there can be no doubt in anyone's mind as to the direction in which monetary policy will be moving in the near future. On the precise timing of the move, I have as little information as you have. Question (translation): First of all, Mr. President, how do you explain the continuing weakness of the euro on the exchange markets. Do you have an explanation for that? And then a question for Mr. Noyer, if I may? The Anglo-Saxon press, Mr. Noyer, accused you of weakening the euro last week because of an interview. What do you have to say to those accusations? I have a partial explanation. And it is mainly, of course, the differential between the economic performance in the United States and that in Europe. In the United States there are a surprisingly and fantastically high continued rate of growth and very low unemployment, but no signs of any inflationary pressures. In Europe we have an economy that is picking up strongly due to the oil prices and the exchange rate itself, with some indications that the risks for inflation are on the upside. Those differences are the main explanations for the development of the exchange rate. But, of course, you can explain anything with the benefit of hindsight. I would like to repeat, as I explicitly did in my statement, that we are of the conviction, given the prospects for both the European and the US economy, that the euro has the potential to strengthen in the future. But do not ask me when, ask me why. The ""why"" I have answered, the ""when"" I cannot answer. Noyer: What I said I can repeat today. It is extremely simple. We have already said it 100 times, namely that the Monthly Bulletin, which is issued approximately one week after the Statement of the President, i.e. a statement of the kind the President has just made, is not sending and will never send messages differing from that in the Introductory Statement. It elaborates on the same message. And, actually, there is one single message coming from the Governing Council, the message that you have just heard from the President. And all the members may elaborate on that, give explanations in their own words, but the message is the same. I never understood why, here and there, attempts are made to set off what was said by one against that said by another. There is one single message coming from the Governing Council. And you have just heard it. On the last question: I have not seen those signs yet. But it may well be that, if the supply increases, the upward movement in oil prices could be reversed. That would be a very welcome signal and indicator for us. As to your argument that you have never heard me so hawkish: well, the signs are increasing that risks to price stability are growing. This also applies to our forecasts and to those of others which stated that price developments will settle just below the 2% level. The risks to these forecasts are increasing. And then, you have to remember that we raised rates by 50 basis points only four months ago and by another 1/4 percentage point only one month ago. So, altogether, this increase of 3/4 of a percentage point in rates still has to work its way through into the economy and we are not under the illusion that we can fine-tune either inflation developments or real economic developments by pursuing an activist policy. But I would just like to give the warning that the risks seem to be increasing. That is why I say that there cannot be any doubt in anybody's mind as to the direction of future monetary policy. Christian, do you have any idea about the first question? Noyer: I would not dare to give a precise figure, but you cannot simply base assumptions on the difference between the actual outcome of M3 at the end of 1999 and the reference value, because there were special factors at the beginning of the year. So, in order to answer your question properly, we should base our reasoning on special calculations, which I do not have with me now. So, I am sorry for not being able to answer, but what is important is that it is not as simple as it may look. As far as supervision is concerned, you know that the Treaty gives the ECB only a rather limited role, namely that of promoting sound supervisory practices in the individual Member States. But supervision itself explicitly falls under the principle of subsidiarity and will be executed at a national level. The ECB has no aspirations to change that situation. We are actively involved in the further development of supervision, but in a co-ordinating role and in the interests of financial stability at large. So, I do not see any tendency towards creating a supranational supervisory body, nor a body encompassing all the financial activities you mentioned in the sphere of security settlement, banking and insurance. As to how that should be organised, I have my personal views on that. But we follow developments in the various countries with great interest. What we do feel is that it would be wise for national central banks to remain closely involved, in whatever way, in the entire process of supervision. Well, I do not think that my statement of today - as I have said before - can leave any doubt about what we have been doing. I gave you a report on what we have been doing in a forward-looking manner, explaining what we think the future will have in store for us and what our policy reactions to that future development are going to be. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, are you at all interested in a stronger euro and, if you are interested in a stronger euro, why? And if so, what exactly would you mean by a stronger euro? How much more does it have to rise? Second question: is there anything else that we journalists from the economic press should know today that was said in the Council, but that we do not have in your Statement? As to a percentage - I cannot give you one. What we are strongly interested in, what we do believe is that - may I paraphrase my American colleague - a strong euro is in the interests of Europe. So we are interested in a strong euro. We are concerned about the recent development of the euro for two reasons. First, because of the potential impact it can have on domestic, i.e. European, inflation and the psychological impact it can have on the credibility of and the confidence in our currency. We are, therefore, interested mostly in a stable euro. Whether you call it strong or weak, I do not really care all that much. But stability is what we care for most and then a strong euro - I repeat myself - is in the interests of Europe. The second question: ""Are there any other matters which would interest you?"" I do not think so. Our communications policy has not changed. We did notice that we were widely reported - as reflected in the last but one question - as seeming to create diverging views and confusion in markets. We are concerned about that. And there was strong urging from all sides in the Governing Council that we should see to it that - if we could not speak with one mouth, preferably with one mouth, we should at least let only one voice be heard. The first question as to how long the lags are with which monetary policy measures work their way through into the economy: it is generally estimated that the lags are in the order of six to eight quarters. So, let us say, around one and a half years. Those are the lags we reckon with in formulating our monetary policy. I cannot give you any specific information on Monday. The ECB was not in the market, in the hectic developments last Monday. We know that one party in Tokyo was in the market, precisely at lunchtime, and that caused some turbulence, but it was not a central bank, I can assure you. And your third question... Yes, asset price bubble. I did not forget this question, I did not want to answer that question. I do not regard it as fair. I must confess that it did strike me, from the conclusions that one newspaper close to your heart drew from the same OECD report you referred to, that the OECD was very critical of the ECB's first year, while another newspaper, namely ""Le Monde"", concluded from that very same OECD report that the OECD had been extremely gracious, that the OECD had been very positive about the ECB. So, there you see once again, it is the same message, which may be interpreted differently in practice. Noyer: If I may add, much the same to what you have just mentioned for ""Le Monde"" also appeared, if I remember correctly, in the ""Handelsblatt"", ""Les Echos"" and probably in other sources. So far, actual wage settlements, as concluded, do not give rise to concern. The major contracts still have to be concluded. And there are signals, at least in the demands, that the contracts could be excessive. But then I want to emphasise, wage demands are not wage contracts yet. But it would be fine to say, so far so good. Well, the ERM rules or the criteria prescribe that a currency should - apart from membership in the ERM - have been stable and should certainly not have depreciated in the two years preceding actual entry into Monetary Union. So that could not be held against Sweden in any way. When a country applies for membership of the European Union, the European Central Bank will have to draw up a Convergence Report and make an assessment of the extent to which that particular country fulfils the entrance criteria, as have been formulated in the Maastricht Treaty. And, certainly for the European Central Bank, membership in ERM II, which is clearly prescribed as one of the criteria to be fulfilled, will be used in the Convergence Report of the ECB as one of the yardsticks for our advice. But I want to point out, in addition, that it is not the ECB that will take the ultimate decision, but the European Council on the advice of the European Central Bank and of the European Commission. Questions: But there have been exceptions to the two-year rule earlier... Yes, but that was a political decision. They were only tiny exceptions, only a matter of months. You are talking about Italy, I assume. That is the only exception I can remember. It was only a matter of months and the political decision was based on the duration of membership and the period of stability preceding actual membership in the ERM. So I hope, for this weekend, that it is enough. ...if I was quoted that way, I was wrongly quoted. What my personal opinion was and what it has always been is that banking supervision should be in the hands of, or closely associated with, the national central banks. And I am still of that opinion. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, does the ECB support Mr. Koch-Weser's candidacy for the IMF? And there is rumour that Mr. Tietmeyer may be put forward. What do you think of that? The European Central Bank is not a member of the IMF, so we have nothing to do with the issue. As to the moves Mr. Tietmeyer may or will make, passively or actively, I will certainly not comment on this. Question (translation): But you surely have an opinion on that? Question (translation): I had the same question. I would nevertheless like to ask it again, in another way: if the euro exchange rate has an upward potential, would you not agree that global factors are what is impeding a ""come back"" of the euro, as is, for instance, the confrontation between the United States and Europe on this issue and on other fundamental issues of global policy? Well, whenever there are uncertainties and risks for a certain currency area - in this case Europe - that have the tendency to weaken a currency - and this goes for the United States and for Europe - there could certainly be a political impact. But when the image presented is one of disunity, of uncertainty, of a lack of strong and unified will, that is never good for a currency. No, that is not what happened. What I was referring to were some large transactions effected in Tokyo, which did not help the euro - on the contrary, they brought it down. And they had nothing to do with interventions. It was not a central bank. And so, it had nothing to do with the question as to whether or not I have changed my mind - but I have not changed my mind. Well, it may have been said that the Bundesbank intervened, but I can say that the Bundesbank did not intervene. There were no central bank interventions. Question (translation): On the IMF again, Mr. President. If Mr. Trichet were to ""sacrifice"" himself and were to agree to the top job at the IMF, would you be prepared to ""sacrifice"" yourself and have an eight-year term of office here at the ECB? Well, Mr. Trichet aside, I have already shown my willingness to ""sacrifice"" myself. "
03/02/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. At today's meeting the Governing Council decided to increase the ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. As a consequence, the forthcoming main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as fixed rate tenders at an interest rate of 3.25%, starting with the operation to be settled on 9 February 2000. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be increased from 4.0% to 4.25% and that on the deposit facility from 2.0% to 2.25%, both with effect from 4 February 2000. These decisions were taken on the basis of an assessment of the risks to price stability in the medium term in the context of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy. Considering the first pillar of this strategy, both monetary and credit growth continue to signal generous liquidity conditions. Monetary growth has consistently been above the reference value and credit to the private sector is continuing to grow at more than 10%. These developments are indicative of upside risks to price stability in the medium term. As for the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy, price and cost increases - including oil and non-energy commodity prices as well as producer prices - have been larger and more protracted than foreseen earlier and hence indicate risks of ""second round"" effects. Such risks, which are of a more enduring nature, are further increased by the fact that the international environment is showing continuous signs of improvement and the prospects of a cyclical upswing in the euro area are very strong. Indeed, internal and external factors reinforce one another and thereby contribute to intensifying the growth of the real GDP of the euro area. The depreciation of the euro which we have witnessed is contributing to increases in import prices. Timely and appropriate monetary policy adjustments should ensure that these risks are kept under control, so that risk premia in financial markets will be diminished. The Governing Council's determination to counter threats of inflation should assure wage negotiators that the prospects for price stability remain favourable. In fact, it will be important to ensure that wage settlements themselves do not constitute a threat to price stability in the medium term. Allow me to give you a more detailed overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. Starting with the first pillar, there has been an upward movement in most recent monetary developments in the euro area. Base effects have largely contributed to the fact that the three-month average of the annual growth rate of M3 - covering the period from October to December 1999 - rose to 6.1%, after having stood at 6.0% in the three-month period ending in November 1999. At 10.5%, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to be high in December 1999. Considering the prolonged deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4 1/2% throughout 1999, as well as the ongoing strong expansion of credit, monetary and credit developments observed remain an important factor contributing to the upside risks to price stability. Turning to the second pillar, long-term nominal interest rates signal increased expectations of a lasting upswing in the euro area economy. Between the end of December 1999 and the end of January 2000 ten-year government bond yields in the euro area increased further to reach the highest level observed since late 1997. Developments in the exchange rate of the euro are becoming a cause for concern with regard to future price stability. At the end of January the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro stood approximately 11 1/2% below its level in the first quarter of 1999. Given both the magnitude and the duration of this development, import prices can be expected to rise further, thereby increasing the risk that upward pressures on consumer price inflation might materialise in the medium term. It is all the more important to take such risks into account given that the outlook for the world economy has improved further. There are increasing signs that the upturn in world growth has become more broadly based across economic areas. In addition to the US economy continuing to enjoy robust growth, activity is also accelerating in other industrialised countries and the recovery is strong in both Asian and Latin American emerging market economies. Euro area growth developments are in line with global trends. Following the acceleration in real GDP growth from the second to the third quarter of 1999, economic activity in the euro area can also be expected to have seen a strong expansion in the last quarter of 1999. Inter alia, the high level of industrial and consumer confidence reached in the last quarter of 1999 and the prospect of ongoing employment growth and further falling unemployment, as reflected in most recent data, all point to ongoing improvements. With regard to consumer price developments, the rate of inflation - as measured by increases in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) - has moved up further. The rise in the annual rate of change in the overall HICP from 1.5% in November to 1.7% in December 1999 was almost entirely due to an annual increase in energy prices. Our expectation is that we shall see higher inflation rates in the next few months. Inflation rates are now approaching higher levels than expected earlier, and larger and more protracted commodity and producer price increases are heightening the risk of second round effects. Against this background it is crucial for wage negotiators to be able to rely on the maintenance of price stability in the medium term. In conclusion, it is the responsibility of the Governing Council to maintain price stability, thereby contributing to ensuring sustainable growth in the euro area. In order to maintain price stability, monetary policy needs to act in a forward-looking manner, counteracting external and domestic risks in a timely fashion. Growth in the euro area is now robust and, in order to maintain favourable conditions for a lasting economic expansion, social partners will need to keep wage increases consistent with price stability, as well as compatible with continued growth in employment. Governments will have to enhance the structural reform process in order to strengthen the economy in a durable manner. Such reforms will not only make a great contribution to the euro area remaining attractive for domestic investors, but will also contribute to increasing its attractiveness for investors located abroad. Overall, consistently acting in line with these responsibilities appears to be most conducive to maintaining price stability at the domestic level and to ensuring robust growth. This will lead to a strengthening of the euro. Indeed, a strong economy goes along with a strong currency. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Question (translation): Mr. President, why did you not believe it advisable to wait a little longer to see whether the increase in interest rates of November leads to lower M3 growth rates? Because what we expect regarding the movements in M3 in the coming months is that they will be very much influenced by base effects and that they will be very difficult to interpret. That is one thing. We expect - just for statistical reasons - to see lower figures in the coming months. And why wait? If you are convinced that all indicators, as well as the two pillars on which our monetary policy strategy is based, are already now pointing towards increased risks to price stability - and that does include recent developments in the exchange rate, which cannot be ignored and which is one of the main indicators we look at - then we were afraid to wait. If we had waited, we would have run the risk, honestly, of being forced to do more than we are currently doing in the future. Well, that is a very hypothetical question. My mother always said: ""if the skies are falling down, all the birds would be dead."" So I would rather not comment on that. Pulled along by the United States? No. We are, of course, influenced by developments in the United States; we are being influenced by the startling phenomenon of a continued, extremely and even surprisingly high rate of growth in the United States, which helps to underscore the strength of the US dollar vis-à-vis the euro. Of course, that is an influence with which we have to cope, but - as I indicated in my introduction - we have the feeling that we are rapidly getting into step with the US economy and that could, and it even should, lead to a - let me call it - more balanced development of the exchange rate as well. Well, as for the future, it is, on the one hand, a signal to the labour markets. On the other hand, it is also an assurance to the labour markets that we are here to maintain price stability. And that is our goal. That is what underlies our considerations for today's increase. The size of the increase - I do not know how you want to qualify it - but you should not see it as a bias in any direction you might think of. Well, listening to the statements I made on behalf of the Governing Council a month ago and to the statements I made only a week ago, I think that they do not in any way point to a panic reaction. At least, that is not the feeling we have. I believe we have prepared markets well enough in their, as it so happens, justified expectation that something would happen. And I do not think that today's decision will have come as a big surprise to any of you here. First, there was no formal vote. Again, as I had hoped and as it was, it was a consensus decision. Of course, we did discuss the size and the timing of the increase. There was no discussion of the direction. But, of course, we discussed the size and the timing. Well, with regard to the timing, the outcome of the discussion - by consensus - was that it was to be today, rather than later. And, with regard to the size, the outcome of the discussion - also by consensus - was that a ï¿½ percentage point, i.e. 25 basis points, was by far the preferable option. It just so happens that the FOMC meets once every six weeks. We meet once every two weeks. And the schedule is known in advance. So, it is pure coincidence that the decision by the Federal Reserve's FOMC yesterday came one day before our decision. I can assure you that there were many contacts in the weeks that have passed and that the development of the exchange rate was not a decisive move that tipped the scales. But, of course, as I indicated in my introductory remarks, in our decision today, we carefully looked at the recent developments in the exchange rate as one of the main indicators which could have a lasting effect on future price developments and which we wanted to counteract. Question (translation): Mr Duisenberg, you have referred to what you have said previously on your attitude in the past months. But, clearly, you were somewhat obscure, no more or less than Mr. Greenspan, because - following the ECOFIN meeting in Brussels - the Ministers of Finance thought that there was no risk to price stability and they thought there would be no increase in interest rates after that ECOFIN meeting. So, clearly, your communication did not get through to the 11 Ministers of Finance. And it does not seem to me that they got your message. Well, even though I had hoped to relay this question on to Mr. Noyer, this time I have to answer it myself. May I refer you to the statement I made after the meeting in Brussels last Monday, which, admittedly, I prepared rather carefully. It did give an indication that we did see increasing dangers to price stability and I can assure you that it was in the same way, in the same words and the same message I gave one hour earlier to the Ministers of Finance. And they understood it perfectly well. The reserves that the Eurosystem holds are a legacy of the past. We have them and we hold them as a responsible ""head of household"". So you can assume nothing about efforts on our part to try to spend them. There is no need for it. It would even be dangerous if we did that. I cannot quantify it precisely. We make an assessment of developments in all markets, of the development of real economic data, of all those data that belong to the broad range of indicators we look at, alongside the purely monetary developments. And what we try to achieve - given that Europe has entered into a phase of strong economic recovery which has even led us to the statement that we are now experiencing robust growth - is a period of prolonged non-inflationary growth in the years to come. No, you cannot take this from that. I will be quite honest with you - of course we have our explanations with the benefits of hindsight about why the euro exchange rate is where it is. We did and we do believe that the euro has a strong upward potential, for the reasons which I have given to you so often. I am no less confident now that that expectation will materialise at some point. I do not know when. Because I do not agree with your statement that we already have wage settlements in the great majority of the euro area countries. The process is still very much underway and we are not just looking at one country, we are looking at 11 countries simultaneously. And with a view to this process our decision is, on the one hand, giving a warning to the social partners. On the other hand, by our actions, we are also giving assurance to the social partners that they can - so to speak - rely on the European Central Bank to deliver price stability over the medium term and that they should also take that into account in their wage negotiations. I will not in any way make a judgement now which we have to make some time in April, as - I think - is our timing. On the state of the convergence process of Greece, so far, I must say, we do expect - we have to expect - that convergence will continue in the course of this year, so that interest rates in Greece will be virtually in line with euro area interest rates at the time Greece actually endeavours to enter. As higher oil prices are working their way through and as import prices are higher due to the exchange rate, we do expect inflation in the coming months to continue to increase somewhat and to taper off a few months later, so as to remain - on average - well below the maximum of 2% in the year as a whole and in the next year. And that time horizon is what we are looking at when we take monetary policy decisions today. Well, there are some countries where it is above 2%. And there are other countries where it is still far below that. But, looking at the whole of the euro area, I doubt whether your prediction will come true. You can expect that we will act appropriately whenever the circumstances give rise to do so. I am repeating myself, but - with the benefit of hindsight - you can find many factors that explain the movements in the exchange rate. The main factor is still, I believe, the different cyclical situations in the euro area compared with the United States, which make it quite normal for the exchange rate to move as it has. But then, of course, in modern financial markets, political factors, like those you have mentioned, do not fail to have their impact on the exchange rates either. We hope to underscore public confidence by our actions and by an appropriate policy to preserve the people's confidence in their currency to the maximum extent possible. Well, I believe that, regarding our last move of 4 November last year, we deliberately, let me say, massaged the markets in that direction between 15 July and 4 November. Again, with the benefit of hindsight, we are now of the opinion that that period may have been on the long side. This time, nobody can say that we did not give indications or warnings that something was going to happen to the public at large and the markets, in particular. Of course, we cannot say precisely when it is going to happen and by how much. This is decided at the time of the decision at the last minute. But I cannot agree with your statement that, this time, we did not prepare the markets at all. I think the opposite is true. If you listen carefully to or read the statement I made last Monday, the statements the Vice-President and some of my colleagues made in the weeks before that, even the statement we delivered together a month ago, then there were many signs that you could expect something. Question (translation): To what extent have you moved your views on the publication of forecasts? You have not published any forecasts yet, but you have said that you agree with the inflation forecasts of the European Commission - 1.5% for this year and next year - which has led to the fact that the IG Metall, for instance, has referred to this 1.5% and has referred to your press conference. Have you considered this further? And when are you actually going to make a public ECB-forecast for inflation? I think in the second half of this year. We are not discussing this in the Governing Council at the moment. We are actively preparing it inside the ECB, with our staff, preparing for what and how we shall publish forecasts. But I can assure you they will come. "
05/01/2000,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Let me first say that, as expected, the transition of the euro area financial markets to the year 2000 went smoothly. This positive outcome reflects the careful preparation of the banking and financial community as well as the comprehensive and flexible operational framework of the Eurosystem. As you will be aware, the ECB took some precautionary measures to ensure against any problem in the transition to the year 2000, including the provision of sufficient liquidity in the money market during the period around the century date change. After the successful transition to the year 2000 there is no longer any need to extend the current situation of abundant liquidity. Therefore, the Eurosystem this morning conducted a liquidity-absorbing operation amounting to EUR 14.4 billion. The operation contributed to restoring more normal liquidity conditions. The Governing Council today conducted its regular examination of the current outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was left at 3.0% and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were maintained at 4.0% and 2.0% respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. Let me start with the latest monetary developments in the euro area. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from September to November 1999, was 6.0%, that is to say slightly higher than the figure of 5.9% recorded for the three-month period from August to October 1999. Accordingly, it remained around 1½ percentage points above the reference value of 4½%. Overall, current liquidity conditions in the euro area continue to be generous. This is also confirmed by the continued strong growth of loans to the private sector (10.1% in November, compared with 9.9% in October 1999). Moving to the euro area financial markets, as we have already noted, it is clear that they were able to weather the century date change without encountering any major problems. The associated risk premium in short-term interest rates had already declined in the last week of December 1999 and had completely disappeared by the time the markets opened on 3 January 2000. Long-term government bond yields have climbed by around 30 basis points since end-November, partly in tandem with bond yields in the United States, but also in response to a more optimistic outlook for the euro area economy. At today's meeting the Governing Council also focused on the economic outlook. In particular, note was taken of the fact that activity in the world economy is continuing to gain momentum as projections for world output growth have been revised upwards recently. This mainly reflects the sustained and high level of growth of the US economy, but also the broad upturn in growth in other industrialised countries and the strong recovery in Asian emerging market economies. The latest developments relating to economic activity in the euro area have contributed to the improved outlook for the global economy and are consistent with the expectation that growth differentials between the main economic regions will narrow. A recent estimate for euro area real GDP growth in the third quarter of 1999 clearly confirmed the widely expected upturn in growth. Survey data for the industrial sector point to continued solid output growth in the final quarter of last year. In addition, private consumption growth should benefit further from continued employment growth and a high level of consumer confidence. As regards consumer price developments, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) increased further in November 1999. To a large extent the upward movement in November reflects higher price increases for energy and unprocessed food, which is similar to the situation observed in previous months. The annual rate of change in the overall HICP was 1.6%, following an increase of 1.4% in October. When discussing the risks to price stability, the Governing Council recognised that, in the short term, consumer price developments are expected to remain subject to further upward pressure. This is mainly due to higher oil prices, but also to developments in the effective exchange rate of the euro and to a gradual unwinding of the earlier downward movements in food prices. The combined effect of these factors is expected to lead to a peak in the overall HICP increase in early 2000 and to lessen thereafter. Therefore, taken by itself, the upward movement in the rate of increase in the HICP expected for early 2000 should not give undue cause for concern. However, in terms of the outlook for price stability in the medium term, it is essential that the immediate upward movement does not translate into general inflationary pressures and, in particular, that it does not trigger second round effects such as excessive wage claims. Indeed, stability-oriented behaviour is urgently required. In conclusion, the available indicators confirm our previous analysis and assessment on the overall situation as regards the risks to price stability. Against this background, we remain both confident and vigilant. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to introduce some of the additional topics. I should like to draw your attention to two items not directly linked to today's meeting of the Governing Council. The first one deals with one aspect of the ECB's monetary policy competence. Pursuant to the Treaty (Article 106 (2)) the ECB has the exclusive right to approve the volume of coins issued by the euro area Member States. To this end, the Governing Council adopted, in late December, a Decision on the volume of coin issuance in 2000. This Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities shortly. The second item relates to the Executive Board's decision to adjust the ECB's organisational structure according to the needs of a still growing institution on the one hand and to better accommodate the challenges ahead on the other. Among the changes you will find an upgrading of the Directorate Statistics to a Directorate General, in order to enhance its role as provider of monetary and financial statistics to the general public, as well as a restructuring of the Directorate General Economics. An updated organisational chart is available in the room this afternoon. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. I do not think that it has anything to do with liquidity operations, both before and after the century date change. The phenomenon we are seeing - as you correctly phrase it, a strong boom in a short period and a quick correction some time later - is by itself not at all abnormal. Duisenberg:I did not mention a high exchange rate, but - for the rest - I expect it to happen. Yes, and, well, so far so good, I would like to say, it has happened. Well, I cannot quantify how serious the risk is. But what we are vigilant about is that the steady increase in the rate of inflation, which we have witnessed over the past and which we are still witnessing, does not translate itself into second-round effects in the form of higher wage demands and secondary price rounds. But then, as I said, for the coming months, we do expect the effects of the higher energy prices, of the higher prices of unprocessed food and of last year's effective depreciation of the euro to work their way through slowly into the price level, so that we - let me put it this way - we will not be surprised if inflation still creeps up a little bit in the coming months, but we are also confident that it will then, after a while, taper off and level off to, we hope, a rate which we forecast for the year 2000, an average rate of inflation of 1½%. I am not afraid of it, but I do not hope for it. About how it has gone so far, I can only repeat myself. We were extremely pleased with the start of the euro, with the transition to the euro, the smooth changeover. We were extremely pleased with the quick adjustment of markets to the new environment, the fact that a Europe-wide money market emerged in a matter of days and that it has functioned very well ever since. We were extremely pleased that - with the exception of a few mishaps in the first few weeks - that our trans-European payment system has functioned so well and so rapidly and that it had - after a few weeks - already become the largest in terms of daily turnover, the largest payment system in the world, which is functioning very smoothly. I think we have reason to be satisfied, that we have demonstrated that this new body, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, could take decisions in time, in an effective way and in anticipation of future developments. So I must say I am pleased with the way - it sounds a little bit like bragging - with the way we actually conducted monetary policy and took major monetary policy decisions. We were, to say the least, not surprised that the exchange rate of the euro in the first few months of 1999 came down from the high level it started at. I was somewhat surprised, although it is explicable, that the exchange rate then went down further - let's say - through the level which had persisted throughout 1997 and 1998 and came close to so-called parity with the dollar. I am pleased that in recent weeks, and especially in recent days, the euro has moved away from that level again. And then, when I say we were somewhat surprised - with the benefit of hindsight, of course, one can explain everything - it is not really surprising that the very different cyclical situations prevailing in Europe and the United States did cause the exchange rate to move in the direction it did. Moreover, now that we see that cyclical developments in the United States and Europe are converging - that, as I said in my introductory statement, the differentials are likely to narrow, if not to disappear altogether - we will not be surprised that our expectation, which we have expressed time and again, that the euro has a strong upward potential will become reality. And the question was: ""For the future, what is our task?"" I think our task is to remain vigilant, to closely monitor economic developments and especially economic prospects and to take the monetary policy decisions in time and at an early stage, if and when the need arises. But that is not today. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, you will be travelling to the G7 meeting in Tokyo on 22 January. The Japanese Ministry of Finance is already spreading the word that the exchange rates between the dollar, the yen and the euro will specifically be discussed there. What principles will you establish at this conference in respect of exchange rate policy and your role in the global economy this year? The Japanese have not yet been in touch with me, nor with others, about what they want to discuss in Tokyo on exchange rates. So I have not given them a reaction and I am not giving you a reaction either. I think that the attitude of the monetary authorities of Europe and the United States will remain - that we will closely watch the exchange rate developments between the three major economic areas, but that, for us, these developments do not give rise to a change in our attitude or policies. Question (translation): Mr. President, you have constantly warned against excessive wage settlements, in view of the inflation risk. Could you give us a rough indication of the mark at which a wage settlement might be excessive. Thank you. The teething problems that you mentioned for TARGET, can you describe what the main problems have been, even if they are teething problems, exactly what form they have taken? No, it is different for the various areas and industries in the euro area. Generally speaking, we would hope that any wage settlement going in excess of the rate of productivity increase could be avoided. Noyer:We have never said that. Some of you, maybe, or other commentators have said so. But, I think, all central banks were concerned about the liquidity situation. We have focussed on that and have avoided making big changes in the last days of the year, so that is obvious. But all I have explained in our assessment is that we were concerned that sufficient liquidity would be available over the turn of theyear. We have ensured that this has been the case. This transition has gone smoothly. Now we have to return to a normal liquidity situation. That means not a tight liquidity situation. It means a more or less neutral liquidity situation. And this is how you have to interpret the fact that we have given a ceiling of 3% to interest rates in our fine-tuning operation to indicate that this was consistent with more or less neutrality, that it is a normal liquidity situation in which the interest rates in the market can hover around the 3% benchmark that we are giving. Noyer: We are not disappointed. What we had proposed to the market in a very transparent way was the size that, for us, seemed to be consistent with the immediate return to what I call a 'neutral liquidity situation'. Now, the fact is that the market participants have been more cautious and asked for less. That is their judgement, and we do respect this. It means simply that the return to a neutral liquidity situation will take a little longer. It will have to be achieved through our regular refinancing operations, starting next week. But this will come naturally and we will see how the market behaves. But, of course, we can only respect the wish of the market participants. Well, you can infer from that anything you want. What we have tried to make clear, also in my introductory remarks, is precisely that this is our expectation of today regarding inflation. If I were to answer your question, I would introduce a bias into the discussion, which is something I do not want to do. That is not a concern I have. An observation which I want to make is that in Europe you will see a tendency toward a greater harmonisation of fiscal structures, in all areas of 'fiscality', let me call it that. But that is a process that has nothing to do with the euro. It probably has to do with the phenomenon of the completely free single market in goods, services, people and capital. And it is a process which will take if not decades, well, then maybe even longer. I would not exclude using it. We have studied it. We are ready to use it. But - as you can see from today's decision - for today, we have decided not to use it. But I will never exclude that sometime this year, or next year, we will use it. "
