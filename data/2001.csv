13/12/2001,Duisenberg,"Co-operation between Europol and the European Central Bank (ECB) already began a few years ago, even before Europol had received the official mandate for dealing with counterfeit issues. I think there have been very few examples of similarly close and fruitful contact at different levels between two institutions. From the outset, the division of labour, the interfaces and the areas of close co-operation were not controversial, even when it came to the details, which is often where the real difficulties arise. We do not therefore need this formal agreement between our two institutions to resolve any contentious issues, but rather see it as a manifestation of our joint and co-ordinated efforts in the fight against counterfeiting. If I were to highlight the main issues addressed in the Agreement, I should first of all like to stress the annual meetings between the Director of Europol and the President of the ECB to review the implementation of the Agreement. This demonstrates the importance that we attach to the co-operation between the two institutions. The major part of the Agreement deals with the exchange of information and mutual assistance in different areas. In this context, I should like to mention the role of the ECB as a central collection point for technical and statistical information on counterfeit euro banknotes and coins. Counterfeit banknotes will be analysed at the ECB and all technical and statistical data on both counterfeit banknotes and coins will be stored in a database which is being established at the ECB. This data will be immediately accessible to Europol and will thus become an integral part of the information, which is needed for an in-depth analysis of a counterfeit case to support police investigations. This division of labour and close co-operation will lead to the optimal exploitation of existing resources and expertise, respecting the competencies of each institution. Comprehensive co-operation and a full exchange of information between all relevant parties are an important element in the concept of preventing and combating counterfeiting. This concept includes three additional elements: First, banknotes which are well protected against counterfeiting; experts have confirmed that the euro banknotes are extremely well protected. Second, a publicity and training campaign to make the banknotes and their security features known to the general public and professional cash handlers; to this end, the ECB, together with the national central banks of the euro area, launched a massive media campaign on 30 August 2001. Third, protection of the banknotes through appropriate legislation; this has been put in place at the European level. In conclusion, I am very confident that we have put in place all the necessary measures to reduce counterfeiting and to bring any counterfeiter to justice. I am also pleased with the good co-operation between Europol and the ECB in a matter which is of utmost importance to assure confidence in and the reputation of the euro cash. "
06/12/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted a comprehensive examination of recent monetary and economic developments in order to assess the prospects for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area over the medium term. It concluded that the information which has become available since the Governing Council meeting of 8 November confirmed our expectations and thereby also the forward-looking decisions taken over the past few months by the Governing Council. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The Governing Council continues to consider the current level of key ECB interest rates appropriate. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 rose to 6.8% in the period from August to October 2001. This was significantly above the medium-term reference value for annual M3 growth of 4 ½%. We confirmed this value of 4 ½% today in our annual review of the reference value. This decision was taken on the grounds that the evidence continues to support the medium-term assumptions underlying the derivation of the reference value, namely those for trend potential output growth of 2-2 ½% per annum and for a trend decline in M3 income velocity of ½-1% per annum in the euro area. We will issue a separate press release today providing further background to the confirmation of the reference value. In comparing current developments with the reference value we have to keep in mind that the reference value is a medium-term concept. Short-run movements of M3 may stem from a number of temporary factors and do not necessarily have implications for future price developments. For this reason the Governing Council made it clear already in 1998 that the announcement of the reference value does not entail a commitment on the part of the ECB to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value. Rather, developments of M3 are thoroughly analysed by the ECB, in conjunction with other monetary indicators and information from the second pillar, in order to ascertain their implications for the risks to price stability over the medium term. The recent strong M3 growth confirmed our previous assessment that, in the phase of relatively high financial market uncertainty after the terrorist attacks on the United States, investors have shifted their portfolios towards liquid and relatively safe short-term assets included in M3. Such shifts should be temporary and should not be seen as indicating future inflationary pressures. This assessment of current monetary developments is also underpinned by the fact that credit growth to the private sector has been continuously falling over recent months. However, we will need to continue analysing developments in M3 closely. Should the current economic and financial market uncertainties subside, any persisting excess liquidity in the economy should be carefully reassessed with respect to whether it signals risks to price stability. Regarding the second pillar, recent information confirmed our earlier assessment that economic activity in the euro area has been weak in the second half of 2001 and will probably remain so in early 2002. This reflects the lower export demand resulting from the current slowdown in global economic activity and the fact that consumption and investment decisions in the euro area are being adversely affected by the current climate of economic uncertainty. However, the conditions are there for economic growth to improve in the course of 2002. There are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require a lengthy correction process. At the same time, financing conditions are very favourable in the euro area. Furthermore, the recent fall in oil prices and, more generally, the expected further decline in consumer price inflation will lead to higher growth in real disposable income and should thereby support domestic demand. Developments in financial markets over the past few weeks signal a more optimistic assessment by market participants of the economic growth prospects in the euro area. All available forecasts indicate an improvement of the euro area economy in the course of next year. In the current economic environment we should not expect medium-term upward pressures on inflation. The need to sustain employment growth in an environment of price stability will call for a continuation of the process of wage moderation. In the coming months, movements in annual inflation rates may be somewhat erratic on account of base effects relating to the relatively volatile pattern of price increases in late 2000 and early 2001. However, annual inflation rates are clearly on a downward trend and, barring any unforeseen volatility in components of the HICP, they should fall to safely below 2% next year. At the current juncture, it is important that fiscal policies maintain a medium-term orientation in order to support the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby strengthening the confidence of consumers and investors. Government budget balances in 2001 are, on average for the euro area as a whole, expected to worsen for the first time since 1993, owing to the macroeconomic slowdown and the lack of expenditure restraint in countries which implemented significant tax cuts. The current slowdown presents a particular challenge for countries which have not yet attained budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus or which have high public debt-to-GDP ratios. Countries without structural fiscal imbalances can contribute to macroeconomic stability by letting automatic stabilisers fully operate. However, there is no case for fiscal activism, as this has often proven ineffective in the past and risks reintroducing imbalances. A key remaining challenge for the euro area is to strengthen the productive forces in the economy by providing the proper incentives for economic agents. The Governing Council believes that the potential upward impact on trend output growth from structural reforms and technological innovation could be large. However, while some progress has been made in the field of structural reform, significant further steps – especially in the labour and goods markets – need to be taken in order to achieve a permanent and significant increase in potential output growth in the euro area. Furthermore, in the fiscal area, governments should pursue determined structural expenditure reforms in order to create room for further tax cuts, and for absorbing the fiscal costs associated with the ageing of populations. Such reforms would enhance the effectiveness of the fiscal environment in supporting employment, investment and economic dynamism. Finally, let me say a few words on the forthcoming cash changeover. First of all, owing to the careful preparations by both the Eurosystem and the other parties involved in the logistics, the changeover is well on track. I gratefully acknowledge the efforts of all the staff of the Eurosystem as well as of banks, retailers, cash-in-transit companies, the vending machine industry and all others who are working hard to make this changeover a success. In economic terms, we expect the cash changeover to have no noticeable direct effects on the average price level in the euro area. This is largely due to the vigilance of consumers and the strong competition in the retail sector, but also reflects the commitment of governments not to increase the average level of administered prices in the context of the cash changeover. In addition, the effects of the cash changeover on M3 growth should remain very limited. Although we have seen a significant decline in currency in circulation over recent months, currency only represents a small fraction of M3 and a large part of its decline has been reflected in higher holdings of short-term deposits with banks. As regards liquidity in the euro area money market, the Eurosystem's operational framework will facilitate a successful cash changeover, as it ensures maximum flexibility in the implementation of monetary policy. Lastly, the model chosen by the Eurosystem to debit the banks for the frontloaded euro cash will help to smooth this process: the banks will not be debited on one single date, but rather one-third at a time on the settlement dates of the main refinancing operations on 2, 23 and 30 January. To conclude, we expect this event to run smoothly and look forward to a good start to the relationship between European citizens and their new currency. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about some other issues addressed by the Governing Council. First, I should like to mention that tomorrow the third seminar with high-ranking officials from the central banks of the EU accession countries will be held in Berlin. The seminar, organised by the ECB in co-operation with the Deutsche Bundesbank, will focus in particular on the structures and functioning of the financial sector in the accession countries. It will be followed by a press conference scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. tomorrow. Second, the ECB budget for 2002 has been approved. It includes a staff increase of about 3%, which will bring the number of ECB staff members to slightly below 1,150 by the end of 2002. Third, the Governing Council has adopted Decisions on the issue of euro banknotes and the allocation of monetary income. These two Decisions and a related press release will be published in all 11 official Community languages on the ECB's website this afternoon. Finally, as the euro banknotes and coins will become a reality for all citizens of the euro area in less than one month, I should like to invite you to join the ECB for a special event in Frankfurt on the eve of the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. During the morning of 31 December the President of the ECB will award prizes to the 24 children, two from each euro area country, who are the winners of the ""Be a Euro SuperStar"" competition. This competition, which was organised by the ECB and the 12 national central banks of the euro area, attracted more than 300,000 entries. We are now at your disposal for questions. It's strange that I have to answer questions which are raised by others, but as far as the Italian Prime Minister is concerned I have not seen it. Our position is that countries should strictly adhere to the aims set in their own stability programmes to reach a budget which is in balance or in surplus by 2003 or 2004. That differs per country. That does not mean that countries have no room to let the automatic stabilisers work. It does mean that those countries which are not well advanced in reaching their ultimate goal have less room than others. And in the end we do believe that it is of the greatest importance to enhance confidence among both consumers and investors if governments stick to their medium-term strategy, whatever happens. As far as Alan Greenspan's analysis is concerned, he points to the fact that structural reforms are much further developed in the United States than in Europe. And that may be one of the causes – the flexibility of the labour market is greater, mobility is greater – that may be one of the causes for the euro, let me call it, ""failing"" to catch up with the dollar so far. I happen to agree with him. No, that would not be a reasonable assumption. Markets have heard enough from me. I have been present in the macroeconomic dialogue, I have been present in the Eurogroup meetings, I have given various speeches. But if, let's say, my ""tone"" does not change, I am convinced that markets will even notice that. I have not seen those latest figures. All I am confident of is that we in Europe will see a recovery, be it gradual, in the course of 2002. And that, on average, the economic growth performance of the euro area in 2002, according to our expectations, will exceed the growth performance of the United States when looking at the annual average. I was very confident earlier this week when I attended the meeting of the Eurogroup finance ministers in which all finance ministers reconfirmed their commitment to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact. And where I will be on 31 December ... I know it, but I prefer to keep that to myself, so that I can celebrate in peace. Duisenberg. The monetary stance is, I cannot but repeat myself, judged to be appropriate for the current outlook in our forward-looking perspective, and that includes the perspective as we see it for next year. We do expect inflation to fall to below 2%, and safely so, and to stay there for a considerable time to come. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, just one question. I am quite sure that you have also made your projections for further developments as far as inflation and GDP in the euro area are concerned. One could assume that, for next year as well, we will probably underutilise production capacities and grow below trend and that, at the same time, we will be above the reference value. Don't you think that this is a problem for you in communicating your strategy? Duisenberg. We have taken note of the forecasts that are being prepared by the staff of the Eurosystem, i.e. the NCBs and the ECB, and those forecasts will be made public in our forthcoming Monthly Bulletin – I believe, on 14 December – so that I cannot comment now on precisely what the forecast would entail for next year. But one thing I would like to emphasise is that we will enter next year in a position of very low growth. And so, when the forecast for next year is made public, you will see an average figure for the year as a whole. But behind that figure, it is very good to realise that there will be an upswing in the course of the year, although the figure for the year as a whole will look rather low. However, by the end of that year we will be close to an annualised rate of the potential growth rate or output as we see it. Question (translation): Will there also be an upswing for inflation figures during next year? We don't think so. Question (translation): Mr. President, in just over three weeks 300 million Europeans will start using euro banknotes and coins with the result that the ECB will also become much more tangible for those Europeans. Does that mean that you will have to explain what the ECB does in a way that is more accessible to the general public? We already explain so much and, to my mind, so well that it can hardly be improved upon. One thing which is certain is that the existence of the ECB, the acceptance of the ECB and the credibility of the ECB will certainly be enhanced when people realise that it is the institution which, so to speak, gives them the money in their pockets. What we do expect are the effects which we have always emphasised. We already see a far greater transparency of prices across the European Union, i.e. the euro area. We see competition to be intensifying because of the single currency. Prices will be quoted in one currency only, and that all the time. This will have a beneficial effect on consumers. The public also count on permanently low inflation rates, to which our monetary policy contributes as much as it can, and that will become visible. Question (translation): Yesterday, the German Government – when adopting its updated stability programme – asked that structural deficits be taken into account, as well as real deficits. First question: what do you think about this? Are you not concerned that one of the euro area countries will go beyond the 3% public deficit level next year. And the third question, perhaps for Mr. Noyer: from 17 December it will be possible for some Europeans to buy euro coins which could already be used in vending machines before 1 January. Are you afraid that this will be a widespread phenomenon? What can you do to prevent this illegal use of coins before 1 January? With regard to the first question, we do not expect the euro area – either in aggregate or even individual countries – to exceed the 3% deficit limit. You can also see that, for instance, in the forecasts which were recently published by the European Commission, which we do not quarrel with. Noyer: On the coins, the principle is clear and I do not think that there will be many incidents. We are aware that there may – by chance or accident – be a few vending machines that may have been equipped to accept euro coins a little earlier than 1 January. If they were eventually to be used by consumers, that should remain anecdotal and would not mean that the euro coins would circulate. They would just be trapped by the vending machines and kept there. So we do not see that as a problem because it should remain anecdotal and would not entail any real circulation of the coins. Of course, we constantly remind retailers, via the banks who sub-frontload them with cash, that they should not – and must not – make use of that cash and put it into circulation beforehand. But I do not think that what you have described is a major issue. Judging from the base effects that I have talked about, I still expect inflation to fall below 2% rather early next year, but I cannot put a precise date on it. This year, however, seems highly unlikely to me. I said that we expect economic developments to pick up in the course of next year. I can be somewhat more precise: I would expect the upturn in the course of the first half of next year. I see no danger of deflation and, contrary to what you are suggesting, inflation is not falling faster than we expect it to. Month after month, it has been virtually precisely in line with what we expect. On the budget, there are 12 budgets that we have to judge, so I cannot give a general answer. There is only one obstacle: we judge our monetary policy stance to be appropriate in the light of what we foresee for the medium-term future, and that is the obstacle. If you have an appropriate monetary policy stance, why should you even consider changing it? "
08/11/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted a comprehensive and in-depth examination of monetary and economic developments. Against the background of the available evidence, it analysed the implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, taking a forward-looking and medium-term perspective. As a result, the Governing Council decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. At this new level, the key ECB interest rates continue to be appropriate to ensure a favourable outlook for price stability over the medium term. In assessing the information which has accumulated over the past few weeks we concluded that inflationary pressures have further diminished. This was particularly apparent from the information under the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, while information relating to the first pillar was also judged consistent with today's decision. The Governing Council considered today's assessment to be in line with available forecasts and its view of economic developments in the period ahead. It is expecting these views to be broadly confirmed by further incoming information on the economic situation. The ECB will publish its own projections in the December issue of the Monthly Bulletin. Let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. With regard to the first pillar, after having grown at a strong pace over the previous few months, M3 growth increased further in September. However, the recent evolution needs to be seen as a reflection of an increased liquidity preference of investors in an environment of a relatively flat yield curve until August, developments in global stock markets and a surge in financial market uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of 11 September. In addition, the growth of credit to the private sector has continued to decline over recent months. Overall, despite the acceleration in M3 growth, current monetary developments do not signal risks to price stability in the medium term. We will continue to closely examine the underlying dynamics of monetary growth. Regarding the second pillar, much clearer signals of a further reduction of inflationary pressures from the demand side have accumulated over recent weeks. Euro area real GDP growth will be weak in the second half of 2001. This is to be seen against the background of the ongoing weakness of the world economy, which depresses the demand for euro area exports. As a consequence, and also taking into account the high degree of uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the current environment is likely to lead to delays in investment activity and, to some extent, also to negatively affect private consumption growth in the euro area. Real GDP growth in the euro area is expected to remain below potential growth also for part of next year. Further ahead, however, the conditions exist for a recovery to take place in the course of 2002 and economic growth to return to a more satisfactory path. The uncertainty currently overshadowing the world economy should diminish, and there are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require longer-term adjustment. Economic policies in the euro area as a whole remain geared towards price stability, the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact, wage moderation and structural reform. Further positive effects on economic growth should stem from the impact of tax reductions in several member countries and from the fact that financing conditions are favourable. As regards the outlook for prices in the euro area, recent developments confirm our earlier expectation of a gradual decline in inflation rates, resulting from the unwinding of the previous increase in energy prices and the absence of further shocks to food prices. In addition, and crucial for the medium term, two factors support the view that wage developments are less of a risk than was previously the case. First, the slowdown in economic activity should contribute to containing inflationary pressure stemming from the labour market. Second, there is now sufficient evidence that the increase in consumer price inflation was temporary, and this will help to keep inflation expectations low. Looking forward, inflation rates over the next few months will probably show some volatility, on account of base effects resulting from previous price movements. However, such short-term fluctuations should not distract from the medium-term trend. We can now expect that price stability will be safely restored in 2002. This view is confirmed by bond yield developments, which are consistent with financial markets expecting inflation rates in the euro area to be clearly below 2% over the medium term. Overall, as our assessment now points to a further abatement of inflationary pressures, this allowed us to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. This follows three previous interest rate reductions this year, bringing the total decrease to 150 basis points. The new level of interest rates is appropriate to maintain price stability over the medium term. This, in turn, will favour an environment conducive to restoring higher economic growth in the euro area. Interest rates across the entire yield curve are now very low by all measures and liquidity conditions are supportive to economic growth. At this juncture, I should like to recall our position as regards the impact of slower economic growth on the euro area countries' fiscal positions. While it is natural for an economic slowdown to have adverse effects on Member States' budgets, it is important that especially those countries with a budget position still not close to balance or in surplus and/or with high public debt-to-GDP ratios adhere to their medium-term consolidation plans. The current slowdown should not substantially change the scope for reaching the medium-term commitments they made under the Stability and Growth Pact and in the context of their stability programmes. Let me again emphasise that a medium-term perspective and continuous consolidation are essential for the conduct of fiscal policy in all euro area countries. This would give a firm signal to investors and consumers, thereby supporting confidence and contributing to a recovery. In their efforts to further expand the production potential of the euro area, governments should also give greater impetus to the implementation of structural reforms. Fiscal reforms, including those related to pension systems as well as to the level and composition of public revenue and expenditure, would provide the correct incentives. Labour and product market reforms will be beneficial to employment growth in the euro area and will improve the resilience of the euro area economy to adverse shocks in the future. While it may be perceived as more difficult to advance in these areas in an environment of weaker economic activity, the need to properly address rigidities should be much more obvious now than at times of buoyant growth. The current weakness should therefore be taken as a challenge to be met by stepping up reforms rather than allowing efforts to abate. Finally, I would like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that, as from today, it will – as a rule – assess the stance of the ECB's monetary policy only at its first meeting of the month. Accordingly, interest rate decisions will normally be taken during that meeting. At the second meeting of the month, the Governing Council will deal for the most part with issues related to other tasks and responsibilities of the ECB and the Eurosystem. After the second meeting of the month, a press release on the ECB's monetary policy decisions will no longer be issued. Obviously, if warranted by the circumstances, the Governing Council can still decide to change the key ECB interest rates at any time, regardless of previously scheduled meetings (as was recently demonstrated by the decision to lower interest rates on 17 September 2001). We are now at your disposal for questions. Now, deflation does not seem to be just around the corner, but HICP will be safely under the 2% limit we have set as the maximum which is compatible with price stability. I meant every word I said and I have nothing to add to it. Not at all. The Governing Council conducted an in-depth review and made an assessment of all the information that had become available until very recently, and indeed in very recent weeks, including the information we have so far from evaluations and assessments which will be finalised in the course of December. And these evaluations led, let me say, to an easy decision in taking this important step. No, it could be a signal that markets have to listen more to me than to others. It was not a co-ordinated action, although we keep each other fully informed all the time. And the fact that, on this occasion, the moves came so close together in time is a pure coincidence of the timing of the meetings of the Governing Council, the FOMC and the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee respectively. But it was not co-ordinated. As regards your second question, today's move fully reflects our assessment, over the medium term, of the inflationary tendencies, and it can be seen, as we believe, that we have with this move reached a level of interest rates which is appropriate as a monetary policy stance in the light of that assessment. No, but we always have to interpret the various moves. We expect it to grow less buoyantly over time. As I indicated in my introductory remarks, there are temporary factors which are very much playing a role. One factor is the high uncertainty prevailing all over the world on account of the events in Washington, New York and Afghanistan. The other one is the uncertainty about the economic prospects and the low level of confidence among consumers and investors. With our move today we want to help to restore confidence. If that high level of uncertainty diminishes over time, which is what we expect, then we can also anticipate that M3 growth will come down to more natural figures. That will be done next month anyway, as has already been announced. We do that every year in December. So far we have decided every year to leave it unchanged. We do not regard it as likely. But it will be very low indeed. That is to say, we do not yet regard a negative growth figure as likely, but figures in the order of 0.1 are not very far from this. There is no trade-off between the first and the second priority. The maintenance of price stability remains our first priority. You can almost literally quote the Treaty in this respect, since today's move could be taken ""without prejudice to price stability"", and it thereby supported the other goals of Economic and Monetary Union, such as economic growth. The Governing Council has not analysed these analysts' analyses in depth, and therefore I also have no judgement on that. We still expect, as I said in my introduction, that inflation will fall to below 2% early next year, which is, in a way, earlier than we anticipated. But I also added the warning that for the next few months base effects will make it look as if inflation is hardly falling any longer, so we cannot expect big movements in inflation over the next few months. This implies that, after a few months, we expect much faster falling rates, but that is purely technical, taking out one month of the twelve every time. On the first question, if I saw any danger in the Fed's actions I would not make this public. And on the second question: we have the impression that the bi-monthly meetings of the Governing Council also lead, every two weeks, to speculation in the markets and higher volatility in exchange rates and market interest rates than would be the case if we had a calmer rhythm of meetings. Now we are still an institution which is very much in the building process. We need two weeks per month for our work to be performed properly, but we thought that it might inspire some calm in the markets if we made it known that a discussion in the media and the markets on the monetary policy stance will only take place once a month. An added advantage which is felt very strongly by many members of the Governing Council is that the monetary policy discussions we have very often crowd out other important tasks and responsibilities, such as payment systems or supervision, etc. Having a meeting without discussion on monetary policy stance would create more time to pay more and deeper attention to the other items. I still believe, and Mr. Eichel has confirmed this in public and in the Eurogroup meetings, that the governments are firmly committed, and remain committed, to reaching their goals as stated in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the stability programmes which they have presented, taking into account and to the extent that, for cyclical reasons, and because of the weak economic performance of the various economies in the Union, the actual nominal figures which are intended to be met are not being met. That is simply the way in which the automatic stabilisers are doing their work. But as you know, countries which have not yet advanced very far in their consolidation programmes obviously have less room to let the automatic stabilisers fully function than countries that have in the meantime achieved a more satisfactory budgetary position. Question (translation): Mr. President, Germany is one of the biggest economies within the euro zone and it is last in the league table of economic development. You were mentioning the reforms, the rigidity of structures. How do you see the situation here in Germany, where economists say that even next year we will not get away from this position of last league player in the table? What do you think politics, the Federal Chancellor, should do as far as this lack of reforms is concerned? I refer to what I said in my Introductory Statement. If the shoe fits, wear it. I do not comment on individual countries, not even Germany. There is, of course, always a danger, but we are very aware of this. If we get advice from all sides, especially political sides, to take certain measures, then one might be tempted to become stubborn. However, we have to be wise enough not to listen at all so that we can take our decisions independently of whatever statements are being made. Why did we wait? Because this development has become much clearer, unlike what you seem to indicate in your first question, precisely over the past few weeks as many new forecasts have become available from various international institutions and private forecasting groups and as new actual data have become available. Our assessment of the economic developments, especially after the events of 11 September, has led us to believe that confidence has been hit harder than we thought only a few weeks ago. And it also means that it will take longer than previously assessed for the economy to recover. On voting I do not take questions. Question (translation): Two questions, Mr. Duisenberg. First of all, with M3 having more than 7% as an average growth rate, is M3 no indicator anymore? We are hearing every month that there is an overshoot. For how long can you overshoot? Does that not mean that this overhang of liquidity might, one day, lead to inflation? Second question: you were saying that economic development in the euro area will be below its potential path as far as growth is concerned, i.e. below 2% or 2.5%, both for the rest of this year and for next year. What is the trend, when will this change, at what point will it change and how do you define recession? Is the United States in recession? Is the world economy in recession? Is the EU in recession if economic growth is under 2% and falls further? I refer to the answers I gave you to the same question you asked earlier. M3 is, for us, an indicator which we use for the actual figures against a reference value, which implies that you yourself have to judge why M3 has moved in the way it has done. As I explained today, we strongly believe that the strong M3 growth over the last few months has everything to do with factors which are really temporary. When will the turnabout come? Later than we previously anticipated. We still think that it will be in the course of the first half of next year but recovery will be slow and moderate. How do I define a recession? I know the definition that many economists and analysts use, which is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. We do not have a precise definition of a recession but we will have very moderate growth. That is true. For the euro area we have a clearly defined goal for monetary policy. And that is that monetary policy should be executed in such a way by the European Central Bank that price stability over the medium term is maintained. And that priority goal with which we have been mandated by the Treaty forbids ex ante co-ordination of monetary and fiscal policy. Question (translation): A question of principle, President Duisenberg. If, in the United States of America, there is a lot of cheap money around, does that mean that the European Central Bank can completely disassociate itself from this? There has been a lot of cheap money around for months. Second question: can you say whether in Europe the reduction of your key interest rates will have any impact on the economy, because in Europe there is not that huge an amount of consumer credit around as there is in the United States. And the third question: do you think and do you hope that your reduction of interest rates will be handed on to the markets by banks as well? I expect that in the markets this move will be reflected for short-term rates, certainly. For longer term rates, this remains to be seen, as we already have very low long-term rates and a rather flat yield curve, although it has, in recent weeks, become a little steeper. As for the first two questions, in a global environment in which we live, of course, interest rate developments, money supply developments and economic developments in general are interrelated. So, what happens elsewhere in major economies of course has an impact, albeit a limited one, on the European economy, and vice versa. I would not call them so much political reasons as psychological ones. That is the low level, or even the lack of confidence, which has to do with political developments. That is the main driving factor behind the very weak economic performance of many regions in the world. And it is true that the role monetary policy can play to restore confidence is a limited one. I wish that the role monetary policy would play to restore confidence were larger – indeed, I hope it is large. Effectively our move today has also to be interpreted as an effort to help restore confidence among the public. "
11/10/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank met today for the fourth time outside Frankfurt. Let me first of all thank our host, Governor Liebscher, and the staff of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, for the invitation to Vienna and for the generous hospitality offered to us. As usual, the Governing Council conducted its examination of monetary and economic developments and analysis of their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. Based on its assessment under both the first and second pillar, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The level of the key ECB interest rates at the current juncture is therefore seen as consistent with maintaining price stability over the medium term. Given the high level of uncertainty in the international environment, we will continue to monitor developments very closely and thoroughly, and we will assess new information in the context of our medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy aimed at delivering price stability in the euro area. Let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. Looking at the first pillar, we have seen a strong increase in M3 growth over the past few months. However, a number of temporary factors play an important role in explaining recent monetary developments. Notably the uncertainty in stock markets and the relatively flat yield curve until August have led to portfolio shifts by private investors from longer-term assets to short-term assets included in M3. Furthermore, the growth of credit to the private sector continued to slow down in August. For these reasons, we do not judge that monetary developments signal risks to price stability at this juncture. This notwithstanding, the developments of M3 will have to be monitored carefully in the coming months. As regards the second pillar, the assessment is currently surrounded by a particularly high degree of uncertainty. This concerns in particular the international environment. Last month's terrorist attacks had a negative impact on economic activity and confidence, which could delay the resumption of higher economic growth. Against this background, it was important that policy-makers in the United States, the euro area and in other countries around the world acted with measures to support confidence. A further positive feature is the recent fall in oil prices, which should be helpful in containing inflationary pressure and supporting the real disposable income of households, thereby sustaining consumption in many countries. With regard to economic growth in the euro area, it would be premature to offer a firm assessment of the macroeconomic impact of the tragic events in the United States and current activities to combat global terrorism. At present, there are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require a longer-term adjustment process. On account of policies aimed at price stability, fiscal consolidation, wage moderation and structural reform, the euro area fundamentals remain very positive. Financing conditions are favourable and inflation is declining. The mere existence of the euro has sheltered the countries of the euro area from adverse intra-European exchange rate tensions, which had typically plagued many countries when external shocks occurred in the past. Taken together, all these elements should provide a much better base than in the past for a recovery in the course of next year once the initial shock has been absorbed. However, notwithstanding all these positive aspects, we will continue to monitor downside risks to the current situation. Against this background, we are confident that inflation in the euro area will continue to decline to a level consistent with price stability. Receding external price pressures, combined with the expected continuation of wage moderation, underpin this expectation. For the time being, we thus see a confirmation of our earlier assessment, which led us to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points on 17 September. In fact, the recent events strengthened tendencies towards lower rates of inflation that were already prevailing before. Given their nature and their expected economic consequences, the terrorist attacks clearly warranted a prompt, flexible and appropriate response by the Governing Council, in the context of the medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy of the ECB. Regarding fiscal policies, there have been very encouraging signs of firm fiscal consolidation in a significant number of euro area Member States over past years, whereas, in a few other countries, progress towards balanced fiscal positions has been slower. It is natural for an economic slowdown to have adverse effects on member countries' budget positions, and there is no need for immediate countervailing actions. However, a short-lived slowdown should not drastically change the scope for reaching the targets set in the countries' stability programmes. For countries with a budget position still not close to balance or in surplus it is important to adhere to their medium-term consolidation plans. Turning to the long-term prospects, in order to raise the rate of potential economic growth in the euro area, structural reforms in the size and composition of public revenue and expenditure, as well as in product and labour markets, have to continue. Advances have been made in times of high real GDP growth, although in many areas, including in labour markets, more could have been achieved. As adjustment needs are likely to become more visible in periods of less vigorous economic growth, policy-makers must now intensify the acceleration of reforms rather than allow efforts to abate. Moving forward the reform agenda decisively will enable the euro area economy to respond flexibly in future and thereby underpin our confidence that external shocks can be more easily absorbed than in the past. As to the first question, I think governments have responded and I think it is exaggerated also to say that governments cannot respond. As I said in my introductory statement, we fully accept that it is natural that adverse economic development or slower economic growth will not fail to have an impact on budgetary positions. And then you expect the automatic stabilisers to take care of that. Well, that can be done, but it is crucial that the structural budgetary policies remain in place and remain geared to achieving, over the medium term, the goals set by the countries themselves in their stabilisation programmes in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact. But in as far as budgetary positions develop, actually for purely cyclical reasons, to develop or to produce results which lead to deficits which are somewhat higher than is in conformity with the medium-term goals, that is acceptable. But it is true that those countries which have already used the periods of high economic growth to achieve the intended position of having their budget in balance or surplus have more room to let the automatic stabilisers work than those countries which have failed to reach those targets in an adequate tempo, let me call it that. As far as the 17 September decision is concerned, let me first point out that that decision to lower rates by 50 basis points in concert with the Federal Reserve System on 17 September came only about two weeks after we had already lowered rates by 25 basis points. In all, we have lowered rates by 100 basis points over the recent period and it is now thought that, barring new events or new information, we have reached a monetary policy stance which is consistent with maintaining price stability over the medium term. In addition, I would like to say that the most crucial challenge that faces the authorities, all authorities, over the near future is to restore confidence amongst consumers and investors in their future. And the big question to answer is what contribution monetary policy can deliver to restore that confidence. And in our opinion a move so soon after the previous move, which was a clear, prompt and appropriate reaction to the terrible events that had happened, would fail to do the trick of restoring confidence at short notice. We believe that creating an environment of stable prices through a stability-oriented monetary policy in a forward-looking manner is the best contribution we can make not only to the growth of output and employment but also to the restoration of confidence within the public at large. It is the whole range of data which will be coming in in the course of the next few months on the development of prices, output and employment, of the balance of payments, i.e. the whole range of data which we usually look at. And they will lead us to reassess the prospects for reaching price stability; currently those prospects are fairly benign. I have to remind you that we expect to reach a situation of price stability early next year. So that, on average, we expect inflation next year to be at the satisfactory average level of just below 2%. With that we are satisfied. What I just read out to you was the considered opinion of the Governing Council. So, you can assume that the relative optimism was shared, but then one side remark: we do believe that growth, which has clearly slowed down in the course of this year and will continue to be very slow for the remainder of this year, will resume in the course of next year and maybe already in the early part of next year. But resumption of growth is not the same as enjoying high growth, though it will be relatively modest. But under the conditions that we deliver, namely price stability. Well, the decision taken on 17 September 2001 certainly does not bear witness to your claim that we are slow in reacting and resistant to change. I thought it was a very prompt and appropriate decision taken on 17 September 2001. To be seen to take effectively what was maybe an exceptional decision in exceptional circumstances, in bringing forward a rate cut that we had already contemplated before, applying it earlier than had been foreseen and making it larger – within a matter of two hours, I might say – and also earlier than anticipated, this in response to the assessment that the horrible events in the United States might have a negative impact on economic growth and thereby also cause the inflation rate to come down more strongly and sooner than earlier anticipated. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, was this non-decision meant to avoid giving the impression that there is a crisis? You were talking a lot about the confidence of investors and consumers, which you want to regain. As I say, maybe 25 points would have helped confidence more than not doing anything? Well, I would take issue with the expression ""not doing anything"". Don't forget, but it seems that everybody has forgotten that we lowered interest rates on 30 August 2001 and then again on 17 September 2001, and we do believe that with that level we have for the time being, barring new information on events yet to happen, new information to come in, that we have reached a level of interest rates which is consistent in the context of our monetary policy strategy with our declared aim of preserving price stability. And I think we have explained that strategy and that aim so thoroughly to the European public and the world that reacting to very short-term, be it tragic, events in a continuously panicky way would, to my mind, do more to undermine confidence than to strengthen it. Question (translation): Mr. Solbes, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, said in an interview on Tuesday that the euro area was already on the verge of recession. He took part in discussions. Can you tell me how they went on this point? Do you share this fear? My second question is on the money supply M3. A large increase in M3 has been recorded on account of money being ""parked"" in short-term liquid assets instead of being invested in stock markets. If this parking of money lasts for a long time, is there not an inflationary risk from this part of M3 because that money might then be used for consumption, since long-term investment opportunities are uncertain? We do not have the feeling that Europe is in, or on the verge of, a recession. Growth is slow, admittedly: slower than we had anticipated earlier, but of a recession we do not speak. Witness, although this refers to only one part of the European Union, the figures published for France for example yesterday, which point to an average annual growth rate of GDP of 2.0% in 2001. We do not regard that as a recession. Neither do we regard quarter-on-quarter developments in the euro area as a whole as pointing to a recession. Now, we believe that the fact that investors have temporarily shifted their portfolio investment into more liquid assets, which are part of M3, is a temporary phenomenon – while your question implies that it will be a long-term phenomenon – and that people would rather spend on consumer goods, I suppose, than start investing in portfolio assets anew. We believe that this is the most likely event and, therefore, we do not consider this course of the growth rate of M3 as a source of future inflationary pressures. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, you pointed out how large the responsibility of fiscal policy-makers is. In this light, how do you view the decision by the German Federal Government to increase taxes? I would say that this is psychologically not a good decision. It reduces purchasing power, increases inflation and makes wage negotiations difficult. Do you not think that the ECB President should offer a word of criticism here? If I were to offer a word of criticism, I would do it directly to the authorities in question. But I do not comment or take questions on developments in individual euro area countries. If we do have room for manoeuvre, there is very little. And events are still rapidly developing and we have to be very careful in using any room which there might be. So you might say that, in view of the very high uncertainties confronting us, also in the immediate future, we prefer to ""keep our powder dry"". Concerning the aid to national airlines, I would suggest that you direct that question at the European Commission. And to change the leadership of the European Central Bank in the next twelve months, I think, would be an unwise decision. No, I am not prepared to do so at this stage. I explained that the decision we took today is a forward-looking decision based on all the information we have available to us over the medium term. And that is about it. Question (translation): Mr. President, you were saying that because of the events on 11 September you took your decision a little earlier than you thought you would have to. Could you tell us what you had thought earlier on? Would you maybe not have taken that decision if the events of that day had not occurred? And as for the future, would you say that similar events could also lead you to maybe speed up your decisions in future as well? And could you also comment on the possible leeway that you might have as far as concertation with American monetary authorities is concerned. Are you willing to go for more concerted measures with the Fed and monetary authorities there? This is a hypothetical question. However, had we not taken that decision on 17 September, I regard it as highly likely that we would have taken the decision, be it on a smaller scale, about ten days later at the regular meeting of the Governing Council. But as I said before, these were exceptional decisions in exceptional circumstances, but still totally in line with our medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy. Now the question becomes even more hypothetical: if the events were to repeat themselves, which, of course, nobody hopes, would you take similar take action? We would naturally be in close contact – as we have been over the past weeks and both before and after 11 September – with our colleagues on the other side of the Atlantic. And we will continue to do so and we will decide what to do as developments occur and as events materialise. I can literally say that we will cross that bridge when we get to it. And I hope that we will never get to that bridge. I did not say that, but I said that it is doubtful whether a range of rate changes coming quickly one after the other would by themselves enhance confidence rather than maybe even undermine confidence. The public has to have confidence in its central bank, in its pursuit of price stability over the medium term, in applying its declared strategy and delivering what it has promised to the public to deliver, namely price stability. And I do think following that strategy – and if the public recognises that we do what we say and we deliver what we promise – is the best contribution that we can make to restoring confidence among consumers and investors. "
30/08/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr. Reynders, President of the EU Council, and Mr. Solbes from the European Commission. Following its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysis of their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, the Governing Council decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The Governing Council considers that the available evidence points to an improvement in the outlook for price developments. This is particularly apparent from the information under the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, while that related to the first pillar remains consistent with a favourable outlook for price stability in the medium term. Let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. With regard to the first pillar, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 5.9% in the period from May to July 2001. However, this figure needs to be corrected for holdings of money market paper and short-term debt securities by non-residents of the euro area, which, according to preliminary estimates, have contributed around three-quarters of a percentage point to annual M3 growth. The increase in the rate of growth of M3 over the past few months must be interpreted carefully. It reflects the relatively flat yield curve and the recent weakness in stock markets, both of which made the holding of short-term deposits and marketable paper included in M3 attractive. As it also reflects the fact that consumers needed a higher level of transaction balances to finance the past rise in energy and food prices, recent increases in M3 growth may be transitory and, hence, do not necessarily have implications for price stability in the medium term. In addition, the annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector, although still high, has continued to decline over recent months. Regarding the second pillar, there are clear signals of lower inflationary pressures from the demand side. Recent data on economic activity indicate that real GDP growth in 2001 will most likely be lower than was expected a few months ago. This is due in part to external demand, which has remained weak and below expectations, owing to slow growth in economic activity in the United States and persistent economic weakness in Japan, which have spilled over to other regions of the world. In addition, consumption growth in the euro area has been dampened by losses in real disposable income related to past increases in consumer prices. All these factors also had a negative impact on investment. This notwithstanding, over time, the expected decline in consumer price inflation, to which the strengthening of the exchange rate has contributed, should support the growth of domestic demand. Further positive effects on euro area economic growth should stem from the full impact of tax reductions in several euro area countries and from the fact that financing conditions in the euro area are favourable. A concern with regard to the outlook for price stability in the coming years has been the possible emergence of second-round effects, via wages, of past increases in consumer price inflation. The information available shows that wage moderation prevailed in the first quarter of 2001. It is essential that this trend continues and, at the current juncture, two factors support the view that this should indeed be the case. First, the slowdown in economic activity which I just mentioned may contribute to containing inflationary pressure stemming from the labour market. Second, there are encouraging signs, such as those coming from data on consumer and producer prices, which confirm that the increase in consumer price inflation was temporary and that, in the absence of further unfavourable shocks, it is likely that price stability will be restored in the not too distant future. The downward movement in import prices which has gradually been taking place over the past few months should support this process. The falling trend in consumer price inflation will contribute to containing inflation expectations of economic agents, thereby influencing price and wage-setting behaviour. This view is confirmed by bond yields, which indicate that financial markets expect inflation developments to be well in line with price stability in the medium term. Overall, as several indicators are pointing to an abatement of inflationary pressures, the new level of interest rates is compatible with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, which, in turn, is essential to create a favourable environment for sustainable economic growth. At this juncture, I should like to express concern about the impact that slower growth may have on the determination of the governments of some countries to adhere strictly to the Stability and Growth Pact in the context of their existing stability programmes. Under the present circumstances, the automatic stabilisers should only be allowed to work fully in those countries whose budget positions are close to balance or in surplus. Let me emphasise that a medium-term perspective is essential for the conduct of fiscal policies in all euro area countries. Short-term discretionary measures aimed at strengthening domestic demand risk having an unwelcome impact on the economy, not least on account of time lags. In addition, if such measures are not consistent with the Pact, they may undermine the credibility of the consolidation process. In their efforts to set the conditions for further expanding the production potential of the euro area, governments should also give more impetus to the implementation of structural reforms. Selective fiscal reforms, including those related to pension reforms, should provide the correct incentives to economic agents. Labour and product market reforms will be beneficial to employment growth in the euro area and improve the resilience of the euro area economy to adverse shocks in the future. Finally, I should like to draw your attention to a press release that was issued today on the ECB Decision on the denominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of euro banknotes. I am now at your disposal for questions. After this question and answer session we will proceed with the unveiling of the security features of the euro banknotes and the launch of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign. I cannot forecast when another move will come, or in what direction it might be. When new information becomes available we will take a decision on the course of action required. But I should say that there is no such thing as a bias in our decision today. We are of the opinion that we have today set the monetary policy stance at an appropriate level to preserve price stability over the medium term. I do not think we underestimated its impact. What we did underestimate was the length and the severity of the US slowdown. We obviously – and, may I say, together with the US authorities – tended to be too optimistic about the duration and the depth of the slowdown in the United States. Question (translation): Mr. President, when you last reduced interest rates in May the development of money supply was lower than it is at the moment. And even back then, when you took that decision, you said that it was due to the fact that you did not want to create major worries concerning the wage rounds and the second-round effects. Why did you wait so long? Despite the fact that the economic cycle had already weakened earlier you cut interest rates only today. If you look at your two pillar theory the situation developed rather negatively, I would say, especially concerning M3. The information we have today, which we have only just received, supports what I just said about the fact that the slowdown in economic growth emanating from the slowdown in the United States is larger, deeper and more prolonged than had been anticipated earlier. And we now have clear indications that that, of course, has an impact on Europe and will also have an impact on inflationary developments in the near future. Which is in itself beneficial and permits us now, and not any earlier, to lower interest rates without endangering the achievement of price stability in the near future. Question (translation):President Duisenberg, how satisfied are you or how unhappy are you with the euro, the level of the euro, the development of the euro?And the second question: Did the Fed decision help you to take your decision today, to say that you are going to reduce interest rates today? And the third question: How do you think this interest rate reduction will impact on the various market rates? First of all the question of how satisfied I am with the euro. I assume you refer in your question to the exchange rate and not to the colour. I am very satisfied with the development of the euro, but I continue to believe that, in the future too, the euro has, given the performance of the European economy and of the US economy, strong potential to appreciate. The US decision: we do, of course, take all new developments into account, including the US decision or decisions. But, independently, they have had no impact whatsoever. And what impact do I expect on market rates? I expect the markets to follow the example we set today. I can only say that I was very pleased when, while driving in the neighbourhood of Avignon in France, I received a phone call from Mr. Eichel. He told me that he had been misinterpreted and misquoted in the press the previous day and that there was no intention on the part of the German government to enter into a discussion of the Stability and Growth Pact and that he wanted to assure me of this. And I was very grateful to him that he did so. And now to your second question. We published the results of our forecasting exercise – when was it? – in June, I believe, and of course we update these continuously. We have come to the conclusion that we can no longer say that economic growth in 2001 will reach the potential rate of growth, which can be put at 2% to 2½%. We do believe that we will have to revise that figure downwards. But there will be no new broad forecast before December. Question (translation): Mr. President, core inflation has not really changed over the last three months. It is still around 2%. So it is still at the upper level of the medium-term target? When looking at core inflation, do you think there are any signs that in the next couple of months this core inflation will come down significantly? We believe that the so-called core inflation rate will come down, but implied in your question is whether this will happen in the next few months: it may take a little bit longer. We expect the overall inflation rate to be below the desired 2% level in the course of the first half of next year. Well, as regards the first part of your question – Has the ECB been engaged in a new communication strategy? – the answer is no. We have continuously tried to improve on our communication whenever it has been perceived as not being good enough. But the strategy as such has not been changed, and we have – may I say with some self-confidence – been satisfied with the outcome of our communication over the past few months. I do not answer questions on voting. And your imagination, I believe, is going too far. "
05/07/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr. Reynders, President of the EU Council, and Mr. Solbes from the European Commission. As usual, we conducted our regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. It considers that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate and should bring inflation back in line with price stability in the medium term. Maintaining a favourable perspective for price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to fostering economic growth over the long run. Let me elaborate somewhat on our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Regarding the first pillar, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 (adjusted for non-residents' holdings of money market fund shares/units) stood at 4.9% in the period from March to May 2001. As indicated previously, there is some evidence that M3 is currently distorted upwards by holdings of money market paper and short-term debt securities of non-euro area residents. Taking this into account, the three-month moving average of M3 in the period from March to May 2001 was broadly in line with the reference value of 4 1/2%. In addition, over recent months, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector in the euro area has continued to moderate. Concerning the second pillar, given the circumstances, it seems particularly important to recall the forward-looking nature of our assessment. At the current juncture economic developments appear to be particularly influenced by special factors. HICP inflation is still high at present, mainly reflecting past trends in energy and food prices. However, given the nature of these shocks and taking into account the present monetary policy stance, we expect them to have only a temporary effect on inflation rates. If no further unfavourable shocks occur, it is likely that annual rates of inflation will start to fall and reach rates of below 2% in 2002 - although the decrease from current levels over the months to come may be subject to some volatility. The main risk related to this outlook concerns second-round effects having an impact on wage negotiations this year and early next. As has been said on previous occasions, when looking back, the wage developments seen so far have been satisfactory, while, when looking to the future, there is ongoing concern. As has now been confirmed, overall economic growth in the euro area moderated substantially in early 2001 and both survey and confidence indicators suggest a pattern of continued growth moderation for the second quarter of the year. These developments appear to be related to the less favourable external environment as well as to the weak growth of domestic demand. The latter reflects the adverse effects on income and consumption from past increases in energy and food prices and the slowdown in investment. However, in the course of the year, domestic demand should gradually recover from adverse price effects, given the sound economic fundamentals of the euro area, previous and ongoing tax reforms and favourable financing conditions. Average real GDP growth in the euro area is therefore expected to remain broadly in line with trend potential growth in 2001 and 2002. Overall, our current policy stance should ensure price stability in the medium term. Of course, we shall continue to monitor closely future developments affecting the balance of risks to price stability, including - in particular - monetary developments, real GDP growth, price-setting behaviour and wage developments. As I said earlier, at a point in time when economic developments are being affected by a number of special factors, the Governing Council would like to stress its medium-term and forward-looking perspective. Monetary policy will ensure a stance consistent with price stability over the medium term. Keeping firmly to this commitment has favourable effects on the economy as a whole. Since the start of Monetary Union, monetary policy has been successful in maintaining low inflationary expectations over the medium term. As a consequence, the euro area enjoys low long-term interest rates which are conducive to both economic growth and employment creation. A factor facilitating the maintenance of price stability will be continued wage moderation. Such moderation will help employment growth and thereby foster consumer confidence and domestic demand in the period ahead. In addition, the prospects for non-inflationary economic growth can be significantly enhanced by decisive structural reform. Delays in introducing such reforms on the basis of cyclical considerations would be at the expense of medium-term growth opportunities. A medium-term perspective is also most warranted for the conduct of fiscal policies in the euro area member countries. For all euro area countries, it is of crucial importance to fulfil in a credible manner the commitments made under the Stability and Growth Pact and those laid down in the context of the stability programmes. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about some other issues. Let me first refer to the current discussion on the potential impact on prices of the euro cash changeover. In general, price transparency and market competition are likely to limit inflationary pressures from the cash changeover. As regards administered prices, the finance ministers forming the Eurogroup have pledged that ""overall, the conversion into euro of all prices, charges and fees administered by their governments will be price neutral or smoothed in favour of the consumer"". The Governing Council calls on governments at other levels and enterprises to follow this example set by central governments. Moreover, the ECB calls upon the public's vigilance in monitoring prices and price changes, encouraging consumer and other organisations to actively engage in this task. Second, I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that euro area national central banks may frontload euro banknotes to central banks outside the euro area as from 1 December 2001. This measure is aimed at contributing to a smooth cash changeover in 2002. You will find further information relating to this decision in a separate press release to be issued this afternoon. Third, as you are aware, the Governing Council paid particular attention to the specific needs of the blind and partially sighted when agreeing on the design of euro banknotes. To that end, several features have been incorporated into both the banknotes and the coins. In order to further assist visually handicapped citizens in recognising the euro banknotes and coins, and to help them to distinguish between the various denominations, the Governing Council decided to allocate about EUR 1 million to the production of 400,000 specially designed cash-testing devices. These will be made available via the network of the European Blind Union. Finally, the Governing Council has adopted a Decision amending the Decision on the adoption of the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the European Central Bank. This Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. We are now at your disposal for questions. Question (translation): Two questions, if you will allow. During the last quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 you underestimated the slowdown in the United States and its impact on the euro zone, just as the governments did. Now, today, you seem to be very optimistic. You talk of a growth potential which will be fulfilled in 2001 and 2002. What facts and what data allow you to be so optimistic about this? After all, in the United States there are more and more alarm signals. That is my first question. Second question. The Ifo Institut published a rather interesting study analysing the reasons for the euro's weakness and it explained that if the euro is weak it is because Deutsche Mark are being sold in great quantities in eastern European countries and in Russia before the changeover to the euro. Their being sold is of course strengthening the dollar. Do you agree with this analysis? It may have struck you that I used the same language today as I used at the last press conference, namely that output growth is expected to be broadly in line with the trend potential growth. That is the best estimate that we have. And it is true that we already had to lower our expectations or forecasts some time ago, as is also reflected in the projections that were published in our last Monthly Bulletin. I recognise that the selling of Deutsche Mark circulating in particular in central and eastern Europe and in Russia may partly have an impact on the exchange rate. However, our estimates are that the sale of these Deutsche Mark to a very large extent takes the form of converting cash into bank deposits, and these can be euro area-denominated deposits. An additional factor is that we are seeing, in particular, a drastic decline in the circulation of large-denomination Deutsche Mark (and Guilder) banknotes coming possibly from the black economy. And we do not know, by definition of course, where they are. But we note that the circulation of these large-denomination notes is taking place. What we do not know is what that money is used for. Is it used to buy other currencies? Is it used to buy real estate? Is it used to buy other types of assets? That, by definition, we do not know. But then I would like to point out that the monetary impact of all this is very limited indeed. If you realise that notes in circulation represent about 6% - and no more - of the M3 figure, then you will also realise that part of that 6%, and really only a small part of those banknotes in circulation, are circulating outside the euro area. And again, part of that small part may then be converted into other assets, which makes the conclusion justified that the monetary impact of these moves in the run-up to the cash changeover is very limited indeed, if not negligible. We cannot deny that it may have some impact on the exchange rate as well. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, I wanted to ask how you would explain the weakness of the euro on the exchange rate market? Second question. Are you going to be present at the Eurogroup meeting on Monday in Brussels? And third question. Do you consider the ECB to be an institution which is ready to have a prime minister, or maybe an ex-prime minister, as its president? I cannot explain fully, as I have said on many occasions, the level of the euro at any particular moment. The tendency to stay in the neighbourhood of 84, 85, 86 cent against the dollar has already lasted three to four months. And all the factors that we have mentioned in the past explaining the depreciation of the euro now seem to have reversed. Yet this has not as yet had an impact on the exchange rate of the euro. But we remain convinced that the euro - and this is not an empty slogan - does indeed have a strong potential to appreciate. That is the considered conviction of the Governing Council. As to the second question, I will be present at the Eurogroup meeting. As for your last question I can only answer that the ECB is ready to have a former minister, namely a former finance minister, as its president, who is sitting right here, right now. Well, the range as such is not that important. The fact that there are inflation differentials between the various regions in the euro area is - as we have explained many times, and, I am almost inclined to say - normal. These differentials will disappear and re-emerge in the future owing to different stages of development in the various countries. The fact that in the Netherlands, and fortunately to a lesser extent in Ireland, inflation has reached the figures they have, is in itself a cause for concern, particularly for the Dutch and the Irish authorities; and, to the extent that they could have spillover effects on other countries, it could also be a concern for us and the Governing Council. That is one reason why we put so much emphasis, even today, on the absolute need for moderate wage negotiations or wage moderation in the negotiating period which lies ahead. Are there too many press conferences? We are faced with the dilemma of, on the one hand, being as open and transparent as possible, and on the other hand, with what we would see were we to have fewer press conferences. I doubt whether we would also see less speculation and guesswork in your circles. We might even see more of this were we to have fewer press conferences. Therefore, next year, it is also our intention to stick to the same schedule of one press conference per month. The presence of the President of the EU Council has certainly helped to improve the dialogue, which we have entered into so often already, and which we again had today. But it is a dialogue, I hasten to add, between the Eurogroup and the Governing Council of the ECB as such, for which I am normally the spokesmen. However, there are occasions when I am not the spokesman, but there are equally qualified colleagues on the Governing Council who can engage in that dialogue in the same way as I do. However, I have noted with satisfaction that the Belgian Minister of Finance, in his capacity as the President of the Eurogroup and now the President of the EU Council, has already attended three out of the first fourteen meetings of the Governing Council, to each of which he has been invited. Noyer: It is on a number of small issues, I mainly wanted to announce that in accordance with our policy of transparency, but there was nothing really that important that I needed to flag. It concerns, for instance, the updating of the internal rules for the prohibition of insider trading, which is normal corporate governance which all central banks and commercial banks in the world have to undertake. Consequently, we have improved the system and everything will be made known and published in detail, but that was the most prominent part of the change. Well, I believe that you should address those questions to the American authorities. I do not comment on the American monetary or fiscal policy in the context of global growth, and that means I also do not listen to advice I get from the outside on our monetary policy. Our monetary policy is clearly based on the well-known two-pillar strategy; that is decisive, and it is aimed primarily at maintaining price stability. Indeed, this is our primary aim and, as the Treaty says, only if there is no ""prejudice to the objective of price stability"", we do take into account the other general aims of the European Community, which are to maximise output growth and employment. The issue was mentioned today. We are concerned that the current negative environment might reduce the impetus in various countries to reach the goals to which they have agreed in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact. And we do see some slippage in the determination to reach the goal of a balanced budget or even a small surplus. That is to say, we see some slippage in some countries in the determination to get there. That is a concern we raised and which I will raise again in our dialogue with the Eurogroup. Well I thought that I could not be clearer than that, but perhaps I should repeat what I said two days ago. I said the same thing as I said at this press conference, namely that our monetary policy stance seems appropriate in the current circumstances. I repeat today that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate in the judgement of the Governing Council and should bring inflation back in line with price stability in the medium term. And this current monetary policy stance remains appropriate, in the opinion of the Governing Council, for some time to come. I cannot be clearer than that, I believe. May I first answer this question? Our forward-looking strategy and our analysis indicates to us that it is likely that inflation will only come down to under 2% - which is our goal - in the course of next year. But then only just. And that makes us say, if we look one year or a year and a half ahead, that this forecast or expectation is based on the current monetary policy stance. So, if we were to change that in the direction in which you suggest, we would in all likelihood not reach that goal. And that is the reason why we did not cut interest rates and it is the reason why we regard our current monetary policy stance as appropriate, as I said to Mr. Sims, for some time to come. No. In particular because I will be celebrating it in the meeting of the Eurogroup. Well, we have always maintained that we did not want to surprise markets. But sometimes a surprise is unavoidable. But it is not our policy to surprise markets. And I believe that in my statement of two days ago and in today's statement, which is basically a statement by the Governing Council, I have been as open and transparent and forward-looking as I possibly can be. Well, in so far as the goals are not being met for cyclical reasons - so that, in a way, automatic stabilisers are doing their work - we have no reason to be concerned. But it will be a reason for concern if structural developments, also in public deficits, do not work at the same pace or in the same way towards reaching the goals of the Stability and Growth Pact in a proper manner. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, on Saturday the G8 Finance Ministers are meeting in Rome. Now, that is a meeting without monetary policy spokespersons, but of course Mr. O'Neill, the US Secretary of the Treasury, ""Mr. Dollar"", will be there as well. Have you started to make any indirect contact with these G7 Finance Ministers in view of the meeting in Rome so that a consensus could be achieved if there were to be any questions on the euro or on the global economy, since the global economy is supposed to be one of the main topics at that meeting? The meeting in Rome, as I understand it, is meant as a preparatory meeting for the summit of the G8 Prime Ministers and Presidents. And for that particular preparatory meeting, no central banker will be present or has been invited, and that also means that I have made no contacts of the kind that you suggest. I have adequate contacts with the central banks of the G7 partners, including Mr. Greenspan. In our projections the monetary policy stance or the level of interest rates is a so-called exogenous variable, so we do not assume any change, strictly for - I am almost inclined to say - ""scientific reasons"". We had a high figure in May. We expect the June figure already to show a decline from that level. But as I have said on various occasions, mainly because of the base effects of the development twelve months ago which, month after month, will fall out of the figures, the road to the level under 2% may be a bumpy one. There may be months in which inflation stabilises or there may even be months in which it shows a further rise. But there will be more months in which it shows a decline. And the decline we expect for the month of June will already be, in our expectation, and according to first indications, not insubstantial, or will be considerable. We take a neutral position on this. We support the aim, namely that over time we hope that the costs of transferring money abroad or domestically will be the same. And we urge banks to work in that direction. Now this process is being strengthened by the current consideration of the Commission to issue a regulation to this effect, thereby forcing the private sector to act in a certain way. We have also considered whether we should do the same, but we think that this would run counter to our mandate to act in a market-oriented way and to let the market do its work freely. "
21/06/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, Today, the Governing Council met for the third time outside Frankfurt. Therefore, let me first of all thank our host, Governor O'Connell, for inviting us to meet in Dublin and for the generous hospitality offered to us. Our meeting was also attended by Mr. Solbes from the European Commission. As usual, we conducted our regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council decided to keep the ECB key interest rates unchanged. We also exchanged views on the issue of the convergence and divergence of economic developments within the euro area. Let me very briefly report on our regular examination and assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Against the background of available information, the current level of ECB key interest rates remains appropriate to ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability in the medium term. As regards the first pillar, no new data on monetary developments have become available since 7 June, so that our previous assessment remains unchanged. Concerning the second pillar, recently published data on real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2001 as well as on industrial production in April 2001 pointed to a moderation of economic activity in the euro area, and the latest information on global economic developments continues to suggest significant uncertainty. In addition, as I already indicated two weeks ago, HICP inflation rose further, to 3.4% in May. Price developments continued to reflect mainly temporary upward pressure from energy and food prices, which was taken into account in our previous decisions. Overall, the latest information did not change our assessment of the outlook for price stability over the medium term. We continue to expect the currently high rates of inflation to remain a transitory phenomenon and, in the absence of further unfavourable price shocks, inflation rates should fall below 2% in 2002. These developments are expected to take place in an environment of weaker economic growth, which should, however, remain broadly in line with trend potential growth of the euro area. We will continue to remain vigilant as regards future developments affecting the balance of risks to price stability, including - in particular - monetary developments, real GDP growth, price setting behaviour and wage developments. At this juncture, at which price developments are affected mainly by transitory factors, it is crucial that the current upward movement of prices does not become more lasting, and it is therefore important that wage moderation is continued. I should like to take the opportunity offered by this special meeting to make a few remarks on what is often referred to as a ""one size fits all"" monetary policy. In this connection, I will address a few issues related to the ongoing discussions about the degree of convergence in the euro area. Itis indeed not surprising that many academics and market analysts devote much of their research to one of the most interesting questions in contemporary economics, namely the conduct of monetary and economic policies in a currency area extending from Finland to Portugal and from Greece to Ireland and encompassing one decision-making body for monetary policy and many more actors for other fields of responsibility. Concerning monetary policy, it is obvious that the Governing Council of the ECB can only pursue one objective - the maintenance of price stability in the euro area as a whole. In doing so, it needs to adopt an area-wide perspective in its assessment of economic conditions and the outlook for price stability. Such an area-wide perspective, of course, applies to all central banks in the world which are responsible for conducting monetary policy. The Governing Council has defined price stability with a focus on the euro area, namely as ""year-on-year increases in the HICP for the euro area of below 2%"". This definition applies to the medium term. The Governing Council's monetary policy decisions are based on an area-wide analytical framework, its now well-known two-pillar strategy. The first pillar assigns a prominent role to monetary developments in the euro area and the second pillar encompasses a wide range of other economic and financial variables - again exclusively with a euro area-wide perspective. Underpinned by this two-pillar analysis, the Governing Council then arrives at an overall assessment and sets the ECB key interest rates with a view to maintaining price stability for the euro area in the medium term. These are the basics of our approach to conducting the single monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. Evidently, a single monetary policy for a group of 12 countries does not imply the same economic developments in the same year in all countries alike, nor does it imply identical developments in individual regions or sectors within a country. Rather, real GDP growth may differ, and there may be differences in unemployment rates or other important economic variables, i.e. there may be regional differences, as is the case in all large economic and monetary areas of the world. Such differences are unavoidable and have existed, within countries, since way back. In many respects, they reflect differences in the quality and in the success of the economic policies of individual countries comprising the euro area. Successful policies enlarge a country's production potential by means of structural reform, ensure a flexible functioning of the economy to fully exploit this potential and ultimately increase per capita income, enhance employment growth and reduce unemployment. As a consequence, successful countries also achieve sound fiscal positions in combination with diminishing taxation. As we are well aware, there are examples among the euro area countries where such highly positive developments have taken place in the recent past. These examples clearly demonstrate that there is ample room for competition in the field of best practices. The most successful countries will eventually provide a benchmark against which other countries will be measured. However, there are types of divergence that can be a matter of concern. Here I would refer, in particular, to a situation marked by high rates of national inflation as a result of excessive wage increases, an unsustainable expansion of profit margins and/or an expansionary stance in fiscal policy. If such developments were to become entrenched in the economy, this would lead to a loss in competitiveness and, eventually, to a loss in output and employment growth. While there is no way for the single monetary policy to take responsibility for such national developments, just as there is no possibility for national authorities to adjust nominal exchange rates within the euro area after having adopted the single currency, national economic policies must contribute to avoiding a situation which would subsequently require painful adjustment. For this purpose, a wide range of national economic policies is available - such as fiscal adjustment, appropriate wage setting, structural reforms and competition policy. Making use of them is not only in the interest of the euro area, but also to the benefit of the individual country itself. To sum up, a single monetary policy for a group of 12 countries can function smoothly. Looking back over the first two and half years since the start of the single monetary policy, there can be no doubt that macroeconomic developments in the euro area have been very favourable. Divergences within the euro area are likely also to exist in future. For the euro area to function smoothly, however, well-balanced national economic policies should complement the single monetary policy with its primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. We are now at your disposal for questions. We regard it as not unlikely. Well, I would not say that. We chose our definition for price stability on well-founded grounds as an inflation rate of no more than 2% two-and-a-half years ago now. It is true that for, I believe, 40% of the period for which we have been working, inflation has been in excess of that figure. But all the excesses have been due to what we call ""transitory factors"", like energy prices, like the food crises, like the depreciation of the euro exchange rate in the last year. And we are, as I say, very confident that we will be below 2% in the course of 2002. We feel no need to revise our own intentions or targets. I will not comment on specific Irish economic management. But when I singled out some countries in the euro area which had demonstrated remarkably successful performance, you can be sure that in my mind I included Ireland in that. Well, as for the expansionary budgetary policy, we do look at that with some degree of concern in an economy which shows signs of overheating. So, we concur with warnings that have been issued against that policy. The Nice Treaty included a so-called enabling clause saying that if the number of countries belonging to the European Union were to exceed a certain number, there could be an abbreviated procedure to change the decision-making process also at the ECB. And we are already considering how that decision-making process could function if the decision-making bodies reach a rather unwieldy magnitude. We will come with suggestions in that respect, as soon as the Nice Treaty has been ratified by all the parliaments, including of course the Irish Parliament, and we hope that at some time that will happen. At least that is my personal hope. The longer the euro stays stable, the less that threat will be. So it is not a threat that preoccupies us very much at the moment. We cut interest rates some weeks ago and we did so also in view of the medium-term perspective. Today we came again to the conclusion that our monetary policy stance is appropriate for the medium-term inflation perspective. The British entry is a purely political issue to be decided upon by the British people itself, and I will not meddle in their affairs. I do hope that we will one day achieve the goal of having a single currency for as large an area as possible, certainly encompassing all members of the European Union. Was that not the same question I had earlier? Whether our objective is too restrictive? To that I answered ""no"". As soon as I have decided to resign you will, after the competent authorities, be the first to be informed of the fact. But I will only decide that when the time is ripe. Well, I have decided on many occasions - and I have stuck to that decision ever since - that I will not comment any further on this issue. I would describe it as appropriate. The ECB is led - in a narrow sense - by an Executive Board. And the Governing Council is chaired by a President and a Vice-President. As Executive Board, we are a collegiate decision-making body. And every single member of the Executive Board is in a position to adequately represent the ECB and to express views as the views of the ECB, and that should be enough. And I have made this position known to Mr. Reynders in a letter which I recently sent him. First of all, regarding the chances of recession, I said that we live in a global environment of very great uncertainty. For the euro area we do not expect recessionary developments. We think that this year and next year the actual growth rate of GDP will be broadly in line with the trend potential rate of growth. And now your second question, which was on M3: We see the M3 development moving or staying at a level close to our reference value - especially when corrected for the well-known distortions by taking out non-euro area residents' holdings of money market funds units/shares. And so we are satisfied that, on the monetary side, we see no threat to price stability at the moment. And that, for the first pillar of our strategy, is enough. We are not so very certain about the precise time path. I already indicated earlier that I regard it as not unlikely that now, in May, we have reached the peak from which inflation could come down. But as for the time at which it will come down, that could be rather volatile. That has mainly to do with the fact that, when the figures come out, then month after month for the annual figures the month 12 months ago falls out. This so-called ""base effect"" plays a role. And those ""base effects"" have been very volatile in the course of 2000. So we are not in a position to predict precisely when we will reach the magic 2%. The word ""recession"" in the German context did not come up. Of course, we discussed the developments in the various countries. We also noted that the developments in Germany are being influenced in particular by the developments in the construction sector. And we would not say that they are temporary, by themselves, but they have a significant impact on the overall performance of the German economy. No, we could not, Mr. Barber, because the German Government has now finalised its draft law on the Deutsche Bundesbank, on the structure of the Bundesbank itself, but has postponed for a few months bringing the draft law on banking supervision or ""Allfinanz"" supervision to the Cabinet - and subsequently to the Parliament, after having received advice on that from the ECB. "
07/06/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. On the basis of the information available at today's meeting, the Governing Council concluded that the current level of interest rates remains appropriate to ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability in the medium term, and thus decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Let me share with you our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy in some more detail. As regards the first pillar, M3 growth has been on a gradual downward trend since spring 2000, driven predominantly by its most liquid components and reflecting the increase in the key ECB interest rates which occurred in the period between November 1999 and October 2000. Over recent months, M3 growth has stabilised. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, adjusted - as explained in the last Monthly Bulletin - for the effects of holdings by non-residents of the euro area of money market fund shares/units, was 4.6% in the period from February to April 2001. In addition, as was also explained earlier, there are preliminary indications which suggest that holdings by non-residents of the euro area of other negotiable paper included in M3 may have contributed half a percentage point or so to the annual growth of M3 in recent months. The growth rate of loans to the private sector continued to moderate over recent months. As regards the second pillar, inflationary pressures will ease over the medium term, although this is likely - for some months to come - to be overshadowed by short-term increases in inflation that relate mainly to oil prices and the impact of animal diseases on food prices. Primarily as a result of the less favourable external environment, real GDP growth in the euro area is expected in 2001 to come down from the high level reached in 2000, and this should contribute to a dampening of upward pressure on consumer prices. This picture of a moderation in economic growth has been confirmed by recently released euro area survey data for May and by partial evidence from national accounts data of euro area member countries for the first quarter of 2001. When looking beyond this year, the outlook for real GDP growth in the euro area is subject to uncertainty with regard to the global outlook for growth. Expectations are that economic growth will be supported by domestic demand and will remain broadly in line with trend potential growth. This is consistent with the strong economic fundamentals of the euro area, current and planned tax reforms, and favourable financing conditions. Wage moderation will have to play an important role in containing inflationary pressures in the coming years. When looking back, as already indicated in my previous introductory statement, the wage developments seen so far have been satisfactory. Looking forward, there is ongoing concern about the emergence of second-round effects, so that wage developments need to be monitored very closely. In this context, it appears particularly important that wage setters fully understand that current price developments are strongly affected upwards by factors which should only have a temporary impact on the inflation rate. The recent rise in HICP inflation, to around 3% in April 2001, was due mainly to developments in unprocessed food prices, the rebound in oil prices and increases in indirect taxes and administered prices. Moreover, the pass-through of the indirect effects of past rises in oil prices and last year's depreciation of the euro have played a role. All these factors will also show an upward effect in the inflation rate for May However, if no further unfavourable price shocks occur, this upward pressure should soon start to diminish, making it likely that annual HICP inflation will start to fall in the course of this year and be below 2% in 2002. Nevertheless, there is a need to remain vigilant as regards future developments affecting the balance of risks to price stability, although weaker economic growth than that currently expected might reduce inflationary pressures. Close attention needs to be paid to factors which might entail a resurfacing of upward risks to price stability, including, in particular, wage developments, energy prices and recent movements in the exchange rate, which is an important indicator to be taken into account under the second pillar. Let me reiterate our position that we have a strong interest in a strong euro. The current increase in the euro area fiscal deficit ratio, the first deterioration since 1993, is disappointing. Fiscal policy will have to resume the consolidation process and governments should abide by the commitments entered into under the Stability and Growth Pact and to those made in the context of their stability programmes. Progress along the road towards the medium-term objective of achieving budgetary positions ""close to balance or in surplus"" cannot be postponed. Finally, the expansion of the growth potential of the euro area economy is an objective to be pursued with utmost determination. The best contribution monetary policy can make in this regard is to preserve price stability. Ongoing policy efforts to remove structural rigidities in the product and labour markets and to diminish disincentives created by tax, benefit and pension systems as well as to raise investment incentives through deregulation and privatisation are all working in this direction and should be taken as the main challenge for economic policies in the euro area. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about some other issues. First, next Thursday (14 June) will be another key date in the countdown to the cash changeover, when 200 days will be left before the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. To date, already more than 8 billion euro banknotes have been printed. This represents over 80% of the launch stock. In order to mark next week's key date, the third media kit focusing on the production of the euro banknotes and coins and on the changeover modalities will be released in all 11 official Community languages as part of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign. Let me take this opportunity to emphasise that the Eurosystem is delighted with the positive response that the ""Partnership Programme"" has received. This is a very important communication channel of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign. So far, over 1,000 organisations from the euro area and beyond have been participating as so-called ""Euro-Partners"". By mobilising other significant players in the cash changeover process and assisting them in communicating with their staff, customers and business partners, the Partnership Programme helps to get the right information about the cash changeover to the right places at the right time. Second, at its meeting, the General Council conducted its annual review of developments in public finances in the EU. It also carried out its annual review of the functioning of ERM II. Finally, let me draw your attention to the calendar for meetings of the Governing Council and General Council in 2002. A separate press release listing the dates as well as the related dates for the press conferences is being released this afternoon. We are now at your disposal for questions. The phrase I used about the euro, that a strong euro is in the interest of the euro area, is indeed nothing new, but I believe I cannot repeat it often enough. Oh yes, well, we have to say it sometimes. Let's turn to the second question: the forecast to be published next week will be based on the broad forecasting exercise which has been executed by the staff of the ECB and all the NCBs. It was part of the input into the Governing Council's decision, but only part of the input. The forecast as such will, as usual, be published in the form of ranges for the various indicators. So I advise you to look at the ranges rather than at precise target or midpoint figures. And as such, I do not believe - although I cannot comment further on forecasts which still have to be released - I do not believe that they are already now too optimistic. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, at previous press conferences you repeatedly mentioned GDP growth of 3% or just below 3% for the euro area. For some time now, though, you have only referred to potential growth. For the 3 hundred million citizens of the euro area, could you perhaps put a figure on how you and the European Central Bank currently assess future growth in the euro area? Second: What is the opinion of the Council concerning the reasons for the present weakness of the euro? I mentioned the growth figure in my introductory statement: I said, indeed, that for this year it is expected that the growth rate will come down from the high level reached in 2000. I also said that our expectation is that growth this year will be in the range of the trend potential growth of output. As to the reasons for this dampening in the outlook, it does reflect, of course, the global slowdown in economic developments mainly initiated by the slowdown in the United States. I can tell you that for next year and the year after we expect again some, albeit only slight, acceleration in growth, which will remain in the same order of magnitude. Question (translation): Well, going back to my first question: I did not want you to say whether the economic situation as such is better or worse. My question was as follows: the three hundred million citizens in the euro area do not know what to make of your ""potential growth"" or ""corridor"". These people have a right to know whether the President or the Council of the ECB thinks growth will be 2%, or 2.5%, or 2.8%. I mean to say your language, or the way in which you are presenting this information... people do not understand that. That is why I was asking the question. Well, then I hope to be understood when I say that - and I repeat - we estimate the trend potential rate of growth of output at 2-2.5% and our expectation is that the actual outcome for 2001 and 2002 will be towards the upper end of that range. The euro has come down rather rapidly from the level it reached at the end of December last year. But it has also remained relatively stable. I will not characterise it as a continued weakness but as stable at a level which, to my mind, leaves some room for appreciation in the future. Well, since I cannot answer the first question, I cannot answer the second question either. Part of the explanation is, of course, the outflow of capital from Europe in the form of both direct investment and portfolio investment, in particular to the United States which, according to our judgement and analysis, may not be inspired by exchange rate speculation but possibly by a phenomenon of strategic importance. Or it reflects a strategy by large European companies over a longer-term period. On its own it is likely to be temporary phenomenon. Well, the expectation is that for 2001, the combined fiscal deficit of all euro area countries will be greater than in 2000. And that in itself runs counter to the trend which governments have set for themselves, in other words to move towards a situation where the budget is balanced or even has a small surplus. So, there seems to be, at least this year, an interruption - although we do hope that it is temporary - in the ongoing movement towards the ultimate goal to be achieved over the medium term. I would not want to give specific figures even if I had them in my mind for individual countries. Today we approved the public finance report, the substance of which will be reflected in the articles and the tables of the Monthly Bulletin. I would not expect that. I have announced today, as I have done in the past, what the order of magnitude is likely to be of the other correction factor in the M3 figures. And, knowing this, I believe that in my explanation today of the considerations and assessment in particular by the Governing Council of the medium-term economic outlook, in terms of both growth and prices, you will find a suitable justification and explanation for the interest rate move we applied a few weeks ago. As I said, a strong euro is in the interest of the euro area. And, therefore, your question seems to run counter to that statement. And I am not inclined to speculate on the impact. But I want to emphasise that the exchange rate as such is one, be it an important one, indicator we look at when assessing the medium-term outlook for inflation. This we want to be at, or preferably, under 2% over the long term. But the exchange rate has not less but also not more meaning for us than precisely that. We see that coming. We urge the public at large, consumers, to be very vigilant in following the conversion as it is applied by all retailers. And in some areas there will also be not upward but downward roundings-off. In particular governments - most governments - have already decided to convert their prices - in as far as they have administered prices - in a downward direction. So we do not expect and do not anticipate that the conversion itself will have a significant impact on inflation. If it has an impact, then by definition it will be a temporary factor. Question (translation): Two questions. Do you have any reason, when looking at the information from the national central banks, to think that cash amounts, for example in Deutsche Mark, in eastern Europe are being converted into dollars before the conversion to the euro - possibly including illegal earnings? Second question. What is your reaction to the criticism made by the Eurogroup chairman, Mr. Reynders, that you were not in Brussels at the beginning of this week when the Eurogroup met? And is it right, for the presentation of the euro, if the Eurogroup makes such criticism in public? Is it not possible for the two of you to get together and to sort out a common way of expressing things? The conversion into euro of national currencies of the euro area circulating outside the euro area is already under way. We are trying to monitor that but it is not easy. We have no indication of a large-scale conversion into non-euro area currencies. On the criticism, which I learned from the media, that I did not attend the Eurogroup meeting, I would like to point out that it has been a tradition since 1954 that the highlight of the annual International Monetary Conference, which is held in a different place every year, is the so-called Central Bankers' Panel in which the central banks, or central bankers, of the three main currencies in the world participate. And I did so. It would have drawn more attention had I not been there, than had I been in Brussels - where, and that is my second point, the ECB was vividly present, and was fully, adequately represented by the Vice-President. And, in the third place, I have to say that sometimes schedules do not fit quite well with each other. I can tell you that the next meeting of the International Monetary Conference will be on 2-4 June 2002 in Montreal, and the year after it will be on 1-3 June in Berlin. On both occasions you can be sure, if it happens to coincide with the meeting of the Eurogroup, that the ECB will be represented in the Eurogroup by the Vice-President. Well, we are doing everything possible to counter it by continuing to explain our monetary policy actions over and over again, as I am doing today. And I think that there is only one way to counter that criticism, which, of course, I do not like but I see happening. May I say that the stream is not coming from all directions, and I think we can do nothing but continue to execute a transparent and understandable policy and to continue to explain that policy by every means we have. I cannot answer that question, but I do not believe in ""complots"". First, if we thought that the risks to price stability today were lower than they were one month ago, I would not have said that we regard the monetary policy stance which we have as appropriate. This is not what we are saying. We are saying that it is appropriate, but we are not saying anything else. Whether we are satisfied with the ""one size fits all"" approach? Oh yes, we are. But ""one size fits all"" monetary policy is a characteristic which we cannot change. We have one monetary policy for the entire area and regional monetary policy does not exist, and we have a mandate as a monetary authority which is somewhat different from mandates that other big central banks have, namely to maintain price stability as the primary goal of the ECB. And only when that is certain, as the Treaty states: ""without prejudice to price stability"", shall the ECB support the other goals of the European Community, but price stability comes first. We realise that the fear exists and we urge the public to be very vigilant, as we are, to prevent it from happening. We also urge governments to counteract it by their own actions in the conversion process, which is inevitable. However, all investigations we have indicate that the effect will certainly be, if not absent, minimal. Duisenberg. The hike of interest rates in October was the last one to date. It was the end of the road which we started in the November of the year before. It was certainly not strangling the economy. Monetary policy - and certainly moves of the size we are talking about - does not have that effect. As to the substance of your question, in my introductory statement I characterised the strong economic fundamentals of the euro area; they have been accompanied by favourable finance conditions, and I think this gives an answer to your first question. Now, to your second question. I have always maintained that the slowdown in the United States would have an impact, but the impact would be limited. And I believe that the fact that it led us to anticipate that growth this year and next would come down somewhat from the - I am inclined to call them - ""exceptionally"" high levels recorded in the year 2000 to a level broadly consistent with the maximum range of the trend potential rate of growth, that is around 2.5%, represents a scaling-down of the growth forecast, which justifies my use of the words ""limited impact"". "
10/05/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. It decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This reduction is to be seen as an adjustment of the level of interest rates to somewhat lower inflationary pressure over the medium term. On the basis of the information available, this is the appropriate level of interest rates to ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability and thereby to contribute to sound economic growth over the coming years. In order to explain today's monetary policy decisions in some more detail, let me share with you our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. As regards the first pillar, also taking into account the latest available information, monetary developments no longer pose a risk to price stability. M3 growth has been on a gradual downward trend since spring 2000, reflecting the increase in the key ECB interest rates which occurred in the period from November 1999. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 4.8% in the period from January to March 2001, which is close to the reference value of 4 1/2%. In the past few months, some slowdown in credit aggregates has also been visible. In addition, as already stated on several occasions, there have been indications that the monetary growth figures are distorted upwards by non-euro area residents' purchases of negotiable paper included in M3. This has now been confirmed by clear evidence, and the magnitudes involved are significant. As regards holdings of money market fund units/shares by non-euro area residents, on which we now have solid statistical data, the distortion has become more sizeable over recent months and currently amounts to around half a percentage point. In addition, there have been non-negligible upward distortions to the annual growth of M3 as a result of non-euro area residents' holdings of other marketable paper included in M3, for which precise statistical information is currently being developed. The ECB will keep the public informed about ongoing developments in these categories of M3. As these factors can be broadly identified, the information content under the first pillar is ensured. Taking into account these upward distortions, as well as all information from the first pillar, it can now be concluded that there is no longer a risk to price stability over the medium term emanating from the first pillar. As regards the second pillar, upward risks to price stability over the medium term have diminished somewhat. This view is supported by all forecasts. The evidence available, however, requires continued monitoring of growth trends and wage developments, in particular. First, owing to the less favourable external environment, a moderation in real GDP growth in the euro area will contain upward pressure on consumer prices arising from the demand side. Notwithstanding the high uncertainty surrounding the outlook for external developments, forecasts suggest that actual economic growth will nevertheless be broadly in line with trend potential growth, supported by domestic demand. Second, wage moderation has so far been maintained for the euro area as a whole, despite the effect of the oil price shock. This has been a very positive factor and lends support to those forecasts which assume that current inflation rates will not spill over into future wage negotiations. This notwithstanding, wage developments need to be continuously monitored. An abatement of domestic cost pressures on HICP inflation remains conditional on the continuation of wage moderation. For the Governing Council, it is of utmost importance that wage negotiators should have full confidence in monetary policy maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. For some months to come, this medium-term trend will be overshadowed by temporary developments in unprocessed food prices following the health concerns related to meat consumption and the consequences of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Moreover, the pass-through of the indirect effects of past rises in oil prices and the past depreciation of the euro is likely to continue for some months. The effects of these extraordinary factors should, however, gradually diminish over the course of this year, implying an improved outlook for inflation to fall below 2% in 2002. The Governing Council has to focus on the outlook for price stability in the medium term as only this perspective allows for the time lags for monetary policy to work its way through the economy. The information under the first pillar indicates that price stability can be maintained over a medium-term horizon. The information under the second pillar indicates that upward pressure on prices can be contained. The Governing Council will continue to monitor wage developments as well as external and domestic demand trends. The picture from the two pillars taken together is positive. At the same time it underlines the need to remain vigilant. Fiscal policy will have to continue the consolidation process in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and the commitments made in the context of the stability programmes. The avoidance of inflationary pressures on a permanent basis in an environment of solid growth requires that governments and social partners implement decisively the structural measures in labour and product markets that are essential for lifting the growth potential of the euro area. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about two other issues relating to the production and introduction of the euro banknotes. First, I should like to address the production of euro banknotes after 2001. As you are aware, the euro area national central banks (NCBs) are producing the euro banknotes they will need for the initial supply at the end of this year. With regard to the production after 2001, the Governing Council has decided to apply a so-called decentralised production scheme with pooling. This means that not all banknote denominations will be produced by every printing works involved. In 2002 some 4.8 billion banknotes will be produced. This volume is based on the estimated national requirements of the NCBs. As the future national needs for euro banknotes cannot be reliably determined on account of the potential impact of banknote migration between countries, production from 2003 onwards will be allocated to the NCBs, taking into account their launch stock requirements, the capital key and the specific situation of banknote demand in some countries. Second, many of you will be aware that this is the ""Week of Europe"" and that yesterday marked the 51st anniversary of the Declaration of Robert Schuman. In this context, the ECB participated in the European Institutions' open days in Brussels and in Strasbourg, which offered another opportunity for the public to obtain information about the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. Furthermore, as previously announced, a series of conferences on euro changeover issues is being organised by the NCBs in the framework of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign, in which the members of the Executive Board are actively participating. These conferences aim to bring together the key parties involved in the euro cash changeover process. Two such conferences have been held so far: one on 6 March in Brussels and one on 4 April in Madrid. Two further such conferences will take place next week: on 15 May in Lisbon and on 16 May in Frankfurt. I should also like to remind you that comprehensive information related to the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins can be obtained in all 11 official Community languages from the Euro 2002 Information Campaign website (http://www.euro.ecb.int). Finally, the Governing Council has decided that its two meetings outside Frankfurt in 2002 will be held in Maastricht on 7 February to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on European Union (""Maastricht Treaty"") and in Luxembourg on 4 July. We are now at your disposal for questions. I will not comment on any particular wage negotiations occurring here and there. I am aware that in some pockets of the euro area, wage developments do heighten our need to remain vigilant. But, as I said in my introduction, so far, wage moderation has been gratifyingly present across the euro area as a whole and we hope to keep it that way. As regards your first question: ""Is there more to come?"", I would like to quote again from my introductory statement. That is, on the basis of the information available, this is the appropriate level of interest rates to ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability and thereby to contribute to sound economic growth over the coming years. Now, with regard to your second question: I have seen Mr. Greenspan in the G7 meetings and also last weekend in Basle. We are continuously in touch, you might say. We exchange information, but one monetary authority would never exert pressure on the other to do this or that. And that holds true for either direction. No, we are, may I say, as uncertain about the precise future development of the US economy, which is of crucial importance to the world, as maybe the US authorities are themselves, and with that in mind, we have revised our expectations downwards in line with all forecasts available on the outlook for growth for the euro area. No, we remain convinced that the US slowdown and the subsequent slowdown across the world which this entails has an impact, but only a limited impact on the euro area prospects for growth, and we remain of that conviction. As I said in my statement, all forecasts available are forecasts by the IMF, the OECD, the European Commission, or consensus forecasts by private institutions. They all point in the direction of growth performance of the euro area at or slightly above the trend potential output growth rate of around 2 1/2%. This is what we took into account. We do not yet have a new internal ECB forecast. As soon as we have, we will let you know. Second question: there was no vote. Third question: I was very interested to see that Mr. Kühbacher managed to reach the front page of your newspaper. And as far as the Governing Council is concerned, I believe it is true to say that they were not yet aware of that. So we did not discuss it. The last question first. We will publish our second forecast, I believe, in the June Monthly Bulletin. What it will look like? I have some intuition, but that is all I can say about this. I do not think it will look very different from the content of my Introductory Statement today. On the last question on inflation. As I have also said on earlier occasions, we have a sequence of temporary factors affecting the inflation rate. First, we had the oil price high in the course of last year and the depreciating trend of the euro in the course of last year. The effects of this are still working their way through, but at a gradually moderating pace. And then, in addition, we have now had, in particular, the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, which has led to a hike in unprocessed food prices, which will also take some time to peter out again. But then, these are all temporary factors. But they do lead us to conclude that, whereas we thought earlier that we would already be under the 2% limit in August/September of this year, for example, it may take us somewhat longer. However, we derive distinct comfort from all the available forecasts - and we have no reason to disagree with them - which indicate that over the medium term - by which I mean within a time span of one and a half to two years - inflation will be under 2% again. We rely on and trust in that. Now, there must be a misunderstanding here. I talked about the distortions which occurred, and which we have already known for months that they were there, but we were not certain of their amount or of their dynamic development, let me call it that. It concerns the holdings of money market funds, issued by euro area MFIs, by non-euro area residents. In the past we were not able to distinguish them from resident holdings of the euro area. We now are. So, it is a refinement of our statistical apparatus. It has taken us a fairly long time. But we are now - and it is only a matter of a few days I am talking about - able to identify them. You will find a full description of the technical details I am talking about in next week's Monthly Bulletin, in which a special box will be devoted to this topic, which I hope will remove your misunderstanding. From now on we will publish the amount of this distortion every month. At the same time we are working - i.e. our statisticians are working - on other distortions, namely the holdings of securities with e.g. an initial maturity of no longer than two years in the hands of non-residents of the euro area. We are still working on this and it will take some more months. As soon as we have an indication of what this involves we will, of course, also publish it. However, there is one significant thing, which is included in my Introductory Statement. We also had the impression when we finally got the results a few days ago - and to be quite honest this was also new for me - that the magnitude of this first distortion I mentioned, which on average is about 0.5 percentage point, has been, and is gradually, increasing over time. So, not only speaking in mathematical terms, it seems that we have to - if you look at the curve - both bring down the line of the curve and reduce the angle. So the dynamics are less than we thought earlier. And that is a very significant element of this revision. In mathematical terms it seems that the first derivative of the distortion is positive. Because it gives it a distorted image of what the M3 figures really are. It is not a distortion in the sense that it was wrong. But we are now in a position to identify elements which should not belong in the definition of M3, which so far we were not able to identify, even though the quality of our statistics is very high indeed. Now we are able to identify them. And also because, as I said, it is not only the absolute magnitude, but also the change in size of this phenomenon - if I may call it that instead of a distortion - that has monetary policy implications. The dynamics of M3 corrected seem to be less that we thought earlier. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, how do you value or assess the euro vis-à-vis the dollar? Is it greatly undervalued, slightly undervalued or moderately undervalued? That is my first question. Second question: despite the fact the American key rates were below European ones, why do you think that there is still not enough capital remaining in Europe and that capital is flowing into the US, thereby further strengthening the dollar. And a further question: is there any scientific way of explaining why two or four weeks ago, despite the fact that nothing much has changed since then, you seemed to assess things differently. I mean, four weeks ago we had the same situation as today, the same two weeks ago and the same today. Why did you change your assessment? I think it is very difficult to follow your argumentation. I could put the question the other way round. Let me ask you instead: was it a surprise that you reduced interest rates today? Duisenberg. That is for you to answer. Whether you were surprised or not? It is not true that there is nothing new. There is. We make an assessment every two weeks. Under the first pillar, we have this new phenomenon of correcting the, may I call it again, dynamics of the M3 developments. That is new. This makes us believes that, although before we thought we were approaching the reference value, now we know that, in fact, we have already been under the reference value of 4 1/2% for quite some time and increasingly so. So that, for example, is in itself new. Under the second pillar there are new indications available. We have new forecasts from other institutions. They confirm more or less what we already intuitively felt was going to happen. We have new figures for industrial confidence, however difficult they are to quantify and to put into our assessment. So from both pillars we concluded that the risk to price stability had, if not disappeared totally, as the first pillar indicates, then at least, looking at the second pillar, diminished. The slowdown in euro area output growths certainly helps to contain inflationary pressures. So that is new information which helps us in giving our fortnightly assessment. To qualify: I prefer to refrain from commenting on the euro/dollar exchange rate. Neither hard nor soft nor tough, so I just take note of what the exchange rate does and if there are any particular developments then we would take it into account for our assessments under the second pillar. But I do not see any particular developments here. Duisenberg. Well I don't count myself among those central bankers who in the last few days have made new statements. When we meet we, of course, come to a consensus view, and we keep on repeating this view until we meet again. And that is what we have been doing. Duisenberg. The first question is easy to answer. We take and keep on taking a euro area perspective. And for us new data on industrial production in Germany or Italy are, until they are translated into euro area-wide indicators, no more than anecdotal evidence. Duisenberg. Well, I hope to have made it crystal clear in my introductory statement, and I repeat now for the second time: we do believe that with our move today we have reached a level of interest rates which is appropriate for the given situation. I cannot say anything about the length of time we will maintain this judgement. If you take the precise correction: for the last figure we have, for example, the March figure for M3 - although that is only a one-month figure - as published was 5.0%. The correction for March can be put at 0.6. So that means that effectively we would be at 4.4. On average for the last three months, e.g. the figure for the period from January to March was 4.8 and the figure for the correction was 0.5. So that would take us to an average figure as related to the reference value of 4.3. And on wage moderation, I owe you an answer to that question. We do assess that for the euro area as a whole wage moderation has gratifyingly prevailed. We do not underestimate - as I said - that in certain pockets or regions there is more pressure than in others, but we remain vigilant. We have to remain vigilant that the - in principle - temporary transgressions of the inflation figure - as we have noticed over time - do not become entrenched in such a way that they would lead to higher wage agreements than would be consistent with our ""guarantee"" that we will see to it that price stability will be maintained over the medium term. Question (translation): Distortion and image. My question is: what about the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB? Now that you have corrected the figures, has it improved or ""disimproved"", because this question must be analysed. You were talking about these distortions, these money market funds held by non-residents: are these ongoing, permanent distortions or do they also have to be seen in the context of the very flat interest rate curve, because there have been more distortions over the past couple of months while this curve was very flat. If it were to steepen again, maybe these distortions would disappear. The statistical corrections are themselves a normal phenomenon. It is almost a fact of everyday life in statistical series that there will be revisions and refinements from time to time. These corrections in no way affect either the formulation of our two-pillar strategy or the application of our two-pillar strategy. This changes nothing in that, but of course we have to take into account the results of those revisions. Most of all if they lead to - as I say - a change in the dynamics of the developments rather than just in the level. It is not our policy to surprise the markets. Sometimes this is unavoidable. That is a fact of life. But it is certainly not something we strive for. It has nothing to do with pressures. It has to do with analysis and assessment. And if you quote me about one week ago, I think you should quote me about two weeks ago - or at the last press conference we had - when we gave statement, or in the G7 context when we gave similar statements; new facts lead to new assessments and they sometimes lead to new conclusions, and that is what has happened. It has nothing to do with pressures from either the inside or the outside or the media or politics. The most difficult thing for policy-makers is to take actions when they are necessary, irrespective of whether there are pressures or not. I could repeat the answer I gave to the previous question that, psychologically, the most difficult thing is not to resist pressure, but to take action when action is needed on the basis of your own assessment of the situation and developments, despite any pressure in whatever direction. Well, if we had waited ... Let us assume we had waited four weeks and we had moved then, and in the meantime we had made public the information as we are making it available today, and more extensively in the Monthly Bulletin of next week, then I am sure that in two weeks time your question would have been ""what is new? Why did you not do four weeks ago what you are doing today?"" It was one of the factors - but one of the factors - that triggered our decision. Quite explicitly I want to say - and I realise I am being repetitive - that our decision was today again based on an assessment of the two pillars of our monetary policy strategy. This involves both the monetary developments, and there we are talking primarily about the corrections, and the second pillar, the assessment of the medium-term outlook for prices and price stability based on a very broad range of indicators. Yes, we certainly need a second pillar in the complex world we live in. First, in response to your first question, I did say, and I repeat, our monetary data and series are of a high quality. They are continuously being refined and we have found two areas in which a revision was called for. That is a lot of work. One area we have now resolved is that we finally have a quantitative idea of what a more correct picture of the M3 developments would be. The second revision will follow, but we need some more months to work on it; we will publish it as soon as we have it, but we do not expect it to show the same dynamics, although it will go in the same direction. That is the revision that has to do with non-euro area residents' holdings of securities, which has to be taken out of the M3 figures. We have the impression that that will be more stable than this first correction but, all in all, I expect it to take another three to four months before we have a precise idea about it, but we will publish it as soon as we know it, and then towards the end of this year we will bring all this together and come up with an entirely new, clean series of M3 figures. "
11/04/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Mr. Reynders. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. It decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. In order to explain today's monetary policy decisions in some more detail, let me share with you our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. As regards the first pillar, M3 growth has been on a gradual downward trend since spring 2000. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 reached 4.8% in the period from December 2000 to February 2001. Growth in credit aggregates has also been less buoyant over the past few months. All in all, the information from the first pillar is signalling that upward risks to price stability have diminished over the past few months. As regards the second pillar, upward risks to price stability have also diminished somewhat over the past few months, but they have not disappeared. Starting with the external environment for the euro area, forecasts for world growth have been revised downwards, and the uncertainty surrounding these forecasts has increased. In particular, this applies to the extent and duration of the slowdown in the United States and Japan, but also to associated spillovers to the rest of the world. While this indicates that the external environment is less favourable than it was up to autumn 2000 and is marked by high uncertainty, there are no indications of a risk of a global recession. Turning to the euro area, it is of utmost importance that current developments in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) be judged appropriately. Short-term price developments are indeed subject to volatility, owing to energy and unprocessed food prices, in particular. Over recent months, the energy component has again been affected by fluctuations in oil prices and the exchange rate of the euro. Unprocessed food prices have been influenced by health concerns related to meat consumption and the consequences of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Also if these most volatile components are excluded, there has been a broad upward movement in HICP inflation since the summer of 1999. In part, this reflects the pass-through of the indirect effects of past rises in oil prices and the past depreciation of the euro. This impact is likely to continue for some more months to come, but should gradually diminish over time. This should be taken into consideration by the general public and by wage negotiators as consumer price inflation above 2% for some more months will be temporary. Beyond the short term, the abatement of domestic upward pressure on HICP inflation remains conditional on the continuation of wage moderation, and wage developments remain an upward risk to price stability which needs to be closely monitored. The deterioration of the external environment will imply a fall from last year's high rate of economic growthin the euro area this year; this reduction will be stronger than that envisaged some months ago. At the same time, however, available forecasts suggest that actual growth will be in line with, or above, trend potential growth. Hence, the moderation in growth should not be a source of pessimism as regards the economic strength of the euro area itself. This is all the more true as the euro area has not accumulated any fundamental macroeconomic imbalances over recent years, and domestic demand can therefore be expected to continue to sustain real GDP growth. Industrial confidence has been deteriorating, reflecting the weakening of world demand. However, consumer confidence has remained high in recent months. Growth in private consumption is expected to remain sound, underpinned by increases in real disposable income which, in turn, reflect ongoing employment growth, reductions in direct taxes and lower oil prices. Economic growth in the euro area is expected to remain solid. Monetary policy has to focus on the outlook for price stability in the medium term. With this commitment to price stability and the policy decisions since the start of Monetary Union, monetary policy has supported economic growth and employment and will continue to do so. Nominal and real short-term as well as long-term interest rates are not high by historical standards. Monetary policy cannot lift the euro area's production potential, which is largely determined by structural factors. The improvement of the structural conditions for raising potential growth is undoubtedly of utmost priority. The responsibility for this lies with governments, as well as with the key national economic agents on the side of labour and industry. To increase potential output growth, comprehensive structural reform policies aimed at an increased labour market participation rate and improved investment incentives are required. While acknowledging that significant progress has been made, a more ambitious implementation of market-oriented reforms is needed in many areas. The still high level of unemployment calls for ongoing policy efforts to remove structural rigidities from the labour markets and to diminish adverse incentives provided by tax, benefit and pension systems. It is crucial to increase investment incentives in the euro area through structural policy measures such as deregulation, privatisation and tax reforms. The continuous contribution of social partners will be essential to prevent temporary inflationary pressures from possibly translating into longer-lasting effects. Finally, fiscal policy will have to make its contribution towards enhancing the growth potential of the economy. This requires both the continuation of the fiscal consolidation process in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and qualitative improvements on the income and expenditure sides of the budget. In addition, I should like to inform you that the visual appearance of the euro banknotes and their security features will be unveiled to the public at a press conference to be held on 30 August 2001, shortly before the euro banknotes are frontloaded to banks on 1 September 2001. It will take place immediately after a press conference we shall now hold to report to you on the Governing Council meeting on that day. Therefore, we have decided to bring the press conference originally scheduled for 13 September forward to 30 August 2001. Moreover, the press conference planned for 2 August 2001 has been cancelled. We are now at your disposal for questions. Question (translation): I have difficulties in understanding your statement, because if I listen to your presentation I have the impression that interest rates will be decreased because inflation risks have gone down and external risk has increased. So, logically, you should reduce your interest rates, although you were saying ""no, we should keep them as they are"". Maybe this was not clear enough in your statement, because exactly two years ago in April you reduced interest rates to fight against risks that seemed to be smaller than the risk that exists today. So why did you maintain interest rates as they are? Why did you not want to change them today? Well, two years ago we did as you said we did. At that time, the two pillars were pointing in different directions, which meant that the decision was not an easy one. Today, as I indicated, the information from the first pillar indicates that upward risks to price stability have diminished over the past few months. I did not say that they have disappeared. In addition, as I said, the second pillar signals that upward risks to price stability have also diminished somewhat over the past few months, but they have not disappeared. And so you might also say that as far as monetary developments are concerned, with our policy of gradually increasing interest rates, which began in November 1999 and the last move of which was made in October 2000, we have achieved what we wanted to achieve, namely moderation in monetary growth and hence the disappearance of inflationary risks over the medium term. But having achieved that does not mean that you then have to reverse the course of your policy. First, on the communication of the last two weeks, I agree that all members of the ECB Council have sounded like a chorus, although it was a harmonious chorus. Maybe this time it was more like a ""canon"" than ""in unison"", but the sound was the same. On today's decision, from the discussions, which involved all members of the Governing Council, it became clear that taking a vote was not necessary. Going back to my statement, the ""wait and see"" attitude was not in the previous statement; it was in the agreed language we all used in the canon we have used over the past few weeks. There has basically been no change in that attitude. In other words, you may say that we have kept interest rates on hold based on the considerations I have outlined to you. And to your second question ... Very convinced. Over that long period... Because that depends not only on the likelihood that it will be under 2% but also to what extent it will be under 2%. In other words, in my perception it will be a close call. I quoted, in my introductory statement, a range of forecasts - effectively - and not the German ones in particular, which, if I look at the forecasts as we know them - they have not all been published yet - of the IMF, of the OECD and of other international organisations, they all revise the expected growth in the euro area and will, and they will also revise the euro area downwards. But as I said all those revisions still leave the growth to be expected at or above the potential growth rate or the trend rate of growth of the euro area. That is the basic reason why I used the sentence that all in all we expect euro area growth to remain solid. We expect the rate of HICP inflation to fall below the 2% figure we have set for ourselves in the course of the second half of this year. And on the Franco-German plans to postpone certain privatisations I refrain from commenting. Of course I am polite so... It does matter. You might say I hear but I do not listen. Now, on the last question, we do not have an exchange rate target. I cannot say that too often, I believe. When you talked about attracting investors you talked about the investment climate and investment incentives, that is not something that is relevant for monetary policy. You specifically - I noted - did not mention the difference in interest rate levels. To answer that question either in a positive or in a negative way would be to introduce a bias in our thinking, and I don't want to introduce a bias in our public utterances or statements. So you keep on waiting and we keep on seeing. Does the euro exchange rate play a role? Of course the persistent - let me call it - ""hesitating"" performance of the euro, which is keeping it more or less stable at a level which is lower than the level which we assumed, on which we based our forecasts, in itself increases the chances of it working its way through to inflation. So, to that extent, it is one of the factors under the second pillar which we take into account. Well, the difference is that at the moment it is fairly stable, and in September last year, that was a moment in time when we had had a long period of a persistent decline - and that is a major difference. And as I said, the exchange rate itself is not a target for our monetary policy so if you want to know what the difference is, I believe I have very quickly explained that. Yes, they have, and they are part of the euro area inflation rate which at the moment stands at 2.6%, well ahead of, well in excess of, our stated limit of 2%, and we do hope that the countries you mentioned will also contribute in the future to getting the euro area figure down under the 2% ceiling. As far as the psychological considerations are concerned, let me first say that these are all hypothetical questions for which this old fox prefers to have no answer. I do not know about the young fox. Noyer: I can go along with the old one. What the actions of other monetary authorities are - of course - we also take that into consideration, but mainly with regard to their to-be-expected monetary effects having an impact on economic developments, and that then forms part of our assessment of the medium-term outlook for the euro area economy. So when that - now in sailing terms - when that bridge opens again, we will decide whether to steer our ship through it or to wait a little while. I promised on 31 December 1998 that I would no longer comment on that issue. All I can do is point to the public statements I made before that date. That is, first of all the public statement I made vis-à-vis the European Council, that I was appointed for eight years and that I did not expect or regard it as likely that I would serve the full term. In a subsequent statement in an interview with the French daily ""Le Monde"" I was asked the question: ""Will you resign half way through your term?"" I gave the simple answer: ""No"". And the following statement I made - and that was the last I made and will be the last that I make - was that I would not comment on this issue again. Also, I will not evaluate what the impact is of statements that are fluctuating on either the euro or myself personally. On the euro I must say, I have seen no impact whatsoever. First of all, two weeks ago, the situation in the markets was such that we thought it advisable to explicitly co-ordinate our thoughts and statements about the monetary policy situation and monetary policy decisions so that we had an agreed statement which all of us, and I mean all the members of the Governing Council, could use so that we would indeed speak with one voice. Now, one Governor used it in this way, the other in another way, and I myself used it three days later. You all heard only one voice and that was the purpose of that agreement, and it was a deliberate effort to do what you all ask us to do: to speak with one voice - but not all at the same moment because that would be cacophony. Your second question was on the frequency of our meetings. We have considered this. For the time being, we have come to the conclusion that it is neither advisable with regard to the operational part of our work, nor for the monetary policy implications it could have, to change the schedule of our meetings at this time. We think we still have so much to do. Also, we are still in the transitory period and it is so necessary that we see each other in the Governing Council so frequently to form and act and perform as a team that the time is not yet ripe to change the schedule for our meetings. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, just a question on the basis of today's decision concerning the policy mix. You had a dialogue with the President of the Eurogroup, Minister Reynders. You are always criticising the fact that fiscal discipline in Member States has been relaxed somewhat. Is there a consensus maybe? Are you saying that, because fiscal policy in the Member States is becoming more expansive, we want to remain neutral and financial policy and fiscal policy have to be more expansive because of the cycle and the position at which we are in it. Is that the deal? We consistently engage in a dialogue, with the Ministers of Finance especially, both in the context of the Eurogroup meetings and at meetings of the Governing Council at which the President of the Eurogroup is present. We cannot and will not co-ordinate our respective policy areas ex ante. We are not planning any changes in these operations. The developments at the last refinancing operation may induce us to do more intensive fine-tuning whenever that may be necessary again in the future. Noyer: If at a certain point in time you have very strong expectations in the market and fixed interest rate tenders, you may have the same kind of problems on the day of the auction. So the choice of a variable rate tender, at least the variable rate tender as we perceive it, which has the very strong signalling effect of the minimum bid rate, does not help. But fundamentally the answer to your implicit question as to how to deal with the risk of underbidding lies with the whole framework that we have designed: we have this corridor with the deposit facility on one side and, in this case more importantly, the overdraft facility on the other side, so that there is no risk that the banking sector will be short of cash. If, as the President just said, conditions seem to warrant at a certain point in time special fine-tuning operations, we can always conduct them, but in most cases the framework we have is enough. Noyer: The answer to your question is - which is not the only case - Spain. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, since you mentioned two statements in connection with the term of your office in this interview, could I just ask again: Just after the spectacular summit in Brussels you said, on the sidelines of the International Banking Day a couple of kilometres away from here, in the evening, when asked whether you could stay for the whole term of office if you wanted to, that you could. Is this still the case, so that further misunderstanding can be avoided? That was also a statement made before I made it known on 31 December of that year that I would comment no further. All the statements I made before that date still stand. Could you take that one Christian? Noyer: The trend of M3 is, of course, clear, but it has been rather steady and it has been slowing. We are coming from a situation where M3 developments were sizeably above the reference value and we have not shown any sign of panic on seeing the development of this kind of overshoot. We acknowledge that it has been partly absorbed by higher growth during last year and the ""trend potential"" growth rates, as well as something which is less positive - higher prices mainly due to the recent imported price pressures - but still there is no reason to panic now that we are approaching or are around the level of the reference value. We are not talking about a monetary base which is rapidly disappearing or shrinking to an extremely low value. So this development is clear and we will see how it continues. It is also in the context of growth of credit, which is relatively high at 9.6%, when we talk about the credit to the private sector. So the liquidity conditions and the financing conditions for private agents do not seem to be tight or to have any consequences for economic developments. That is our clear assessment. Now, of course, this development in M3 is also to be regarded with some caution. When we look at the precise figure, I think we have signalled three times in the Monthly Bulletin that we were working on the limited, but still possible, revisions of money figures because of one or two factors, mainly the importance of money market instruments owned by non-EMU residents, which should not appear in M3. There are some statistical projects under way to evaluate this more precisely. It is likely that the figures will have to be revised slightly towards the end of this year. But that will not change the overall trend, let me put it that way. Finally, as regards the reference value, I think we have explained clearly what was behind that. We have always emphasised that if actual growth was developing at a higher rate than what we call the ""trend potential"" growth, then we could of course accept the development of M3 being higher than the reference value. And that indeed is something that has happened and, as I said, did not create any panic at the European Central Bank. Of course, we said if there can be growth 1% higher than the trend potential growth, and that leads to 1% more in M3 development than the reference value, then that is fine, it is no problem. If that creates price pressures then we have to take them into account and prevent them from developing into a threat, in the medium term, to price stability. This is also what we have done. "
01/03/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The decision to keep interest rates unchanged reflects the following assessment. As regards the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, data for January 2001 indicated that the moderation of the growth of monetary aggregates, which has been observed since the spring of last year, continued. According to the latest data, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 in the months from November 2000 to January 2001 stood at 5.0%, which was slightly lower than the average of 5.1% recorded for the period from October to December 2000. As regards the second pillar, there are indications that euro area real GDP growth was lower in the second half of last year than in the first half, but the general outlook for this year and next remains positive. Economic activity in the euro area is mainly determined by domestic factors. The conditions on the domestic side, as shown in long-term financing costs and disposable income developments, for example, have remained favourable. In addition, the euro area's high rates of capacity utilisation, continuing employment growth and declines in unemployment should contribute to fostering private investment and consumption. The overall level of confidence in the euro area has remained high and economic indicators relating to developments around the turn of the year support the view that economic growth will remain fairly robust. This notwithstanding, an element of uncertainty with regard to the outlook for euro area growth continues to be the world economy and its potential impact on euro area developments. However, at this juncture, there are no signs that the slowdown in the US economy is having significant and lasting spillover effects on the euro area. Nevertheless, a close monitoring of global developments is warranted. As regards recent price developments, the annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in January 2001 was 2.4%, as published by Eurostat, 0.2 percentage point lower than in December 2000. The rate of increase in energy prices continued to decline, but other HICP components, notably unprocessed food and services prices, rose significantly. The latter have been affected by increases in indirect taxation and administered prices. Oil prices and the euro exchange rate in January and February 2001 were subject to some volatility. Caution is therefore warranted in assessing their likely impact on HICP inflation in the short run. Moreover, indirect effects of past oil price increases and the depreciation of the euro are still coming through, as witnessed by the continued rise in producer price increases for consumer goods. Taken together, these factors might prevent consumer price inflation from falling quickly below 2% for some months to come. Governments can contribute to fostering non-inflationary growth by continuing structural reforms in order to further enhance the flexibility of labour and goods markets in the euro area. Long-term growth perspectives for the euro area will also benefit if governments reinforce their efforts to proceed along the path of fiscal consolidation. It is regrettable that budgetary plans, as recently expressed in countries' updated stability programmes, are not very ambitious. Tax cuts are welcome, but current budgetary plans foresee insufficient spending restraint. Overall, for the medium-term outlook for price stability, risks appear to be more balanced than in late 2000. In particular, the indications from M3 growth over recent months point to a gradual decline in upward risks. However, some factors still argue for caution. In this respect, it is crucial that social partners continue the process of wage moderation seen in the past. In this, they can be assured that the Governing Council will maintain price stability over the medium term. We are now at your disposal for questions. That's quite a story, but I can answer both questions in one sentence. The ECB exclusively takes a euro area-wide perspective. So, in the preparation of its decisions, it takes a euro area-wide perspective and there is no question that monetary policy will be decided along considerations of national or regional interests, and that answers your second question at the same time. Monetary policy is one and indivisible for the euro area as a whole. There does not exist any regional monetary policy. Duisenberg:Taking your questions in reverse order, we did not discuss stopping the minimum bid rate. The monetary policy stance of today should be interpreted as being just the same as it was four weeks ago. So if you qualify it as ""wait-and-see"", I would repeat that qualification. We do not see signs that the very gradual slowdown of M3 in the direction of the reference value might be interrupted in the near future. We did not discuss Turkey. We did provide the Governing Council with an analysis of the events in Turkey and the possibility of spill-over effects to the euro area, which concludes that such spill-over effects are not to be feared. Well, if the summit in Stockholm would reinforce the goal of further structural reforms in labour and goods markets, that would be a very welcome and helpful sign supporting our policies. I promise today that I will stick to my promise not to comment on that issue again. The Governing Council does not give any reasons for the way the exchange rate is behaving. As you are well aware, the exchange rate is not a target for the Governing Council and, therefore, let's say, we take it as it comes unless there are developments that are clearly unacceptable and taking the exchange rate too far away from what it fundamentally should be. Question (translation): Mr. President, I have a question on the price standard. You quantify price stability by saying that the increase in prices should be below 2%. There are now assessments according to which this average rate in 2001 will be exceeded, just as it was in 2000. Now we hear that there are discussions that this target should be increased upwards, with the argument that small economies have to catch up. There is a special statement here saying that the price index could be justifiably increased. Are there any discussions in that direction and how do you see this development? No discussions are under way. We do not have under consideration any change in our stated objective whereby price stability is defined as a rate of increase in the HICP index of less than 2% over the medium term, and as far as policy is concerned, we are confident that we will reach that goal. As I said, it may be another couple of months before we are there again, after the disturbance which was caused last year by the increase in oil prices and the depreciating tendency of the euro. But our assessment for 2001, and also for 2002, is that we will fulfil our mandate. We have analysed it, of course. We have taken it into account. We have not come to the conclusion that it might be so significant as to warrant any emergency measures . But it could have some temporary upward effect on inflation rates, which you might interpret as an external shock, as was the increase in oil prices last year. But we certainly do not think it will be of that magnitude. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, the US rates are significantly higher than those in Euroland. Can you say what that means for the ECB's monetary policy? Second question: Time and time again you said that the euro was too weak. How do you judge the present exchange rate? Is it average? Is it still too weak? What do you think? As in my reply to an earlier question, we do not see the exchange rate as a target. We considered it too weak in September and October last year. We then took action and did something about it. By virtue of the fact that we are taking no action at present, you can assume that we are not perturbed by the present state and development of the exchange rate. Now, we have indeed noted that the interest rates in the United States are still higher than in Europe. But, again, our goal is to maintain price stability in Europe. The European economy, even after taking financial market movements into account, is a closed enough economy to justify us ignoring those differentials. ... on that I can repeat what I said in response to the first question. But I do confirm that today's monetary policy stance is the same as it was four weeks ago. That is correct. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, two questions. The first question is on the money market. In the last couple of days, overnight money rates increased dramatically. That is certainly due to the fact that banks did not bid sufficiently for the business earlier on. But my question is why did the ECB not help after a couple of days? Why did the ECB not make up for this? And why did it leave especially small and medium-sized banks on their own? Now for my second question: You were saying that inflationary outlook is more or less moderate. The HICP, however, will probably remain at 2% for quite some time. Does that mean that any increase and decrease in interest rates will only occur if the HICP is under 2%? Christian can already start thinking about the first question... When I said that we are confident that we will reach and achieve our mandate of an inflation rate of less than 2% within the next few months and stay there for 2001 and even 2002, that assessment is based on the assumption that interest rates will remain unchanged. In other words, we do not plan to change our monetary stance on the basis of the information that we have available today. What will happen in the future - nobody knows. Noyer: As regards your question on overnight interest rates in the money market and what the ECB has done, the fact is that immediately following the clear underbidding from the banking community, we were close to the end of a maintenance period for minimum reserves. That also means close to the beginning of the next one. We were therefore in the difficult position of the following tender covering the end of one period and the beginning of another. And the liquidity of the banking sector was different between these two sub-periods. In this context, the ECB did what we thought we had to do. In other words, in order to help the money markets we gave more liquidity than we would have normally given. But there was no way we could technically resolve the problem in its entirety, in other words avoid an increase in the interest rate, unless we had been active on a daily basis in the market by way of fine tuning operations. But this would signal a different type of liquidity provision to the market than the one adopted in complete accordance with what most of the national central banks were doing before Stage Three of Monetary Union. So, we believe that the market has understood that well and that the problem has been overcome by the banking sector. I think you would have to look a second time. No, but Finland is. We have decided that the amount to be printed in the first stage is 14.25 billion banknotes. 6 billion of those have already been printed. I would like to emphasise that the campaign does not try to sell a product, or to sell the euro. The explicit aim of the campaign is to familiarise the public at large, including certain interest groups with the new money. But the question of confidence or trust in the new money is not part of this campaign. That is not the aim. The aim is to make the public familiar with the money that will inevitably be introduced. was...? It does not. Our budget for this campaign, but that is exclusively the Eurosystem's budget, is €80 million. And that also covers the costs of TV ads, newspaper ads, etc. What you have to realise - and I cannot give you an overall figure for this - is that some national central banks (on country specific issues) and practically all national governments and specific interest groups all have their own campaigns in addition. So there is a lot more money to be spent than just our €80 million. There is very close co-ordination with all national authorities, be it central banks or governments that is closely co-ordinated and we will use the same slogan the world over. But parts of the campaign will indeed be directed towards areas that do not belong the euro area that includes the United States and Hong Kong for example and it will be conducted also through media which reaches, may I call it, the entire world rather than the euro area alone. Körber: And, if I may add, I think we have a good right to say as Europeans and members of the euro area: ""The euro our money"". So the addressees should not misperceive that as if the euro would be imposed on them. But if they want to know whose money it is, it is our money. Körber: Could I kindly ask you to concentrate on the information campaign because this is the section we are now in. I do not know whether you have any comments on Mr. Reynders' quote. We do not even have an exact wording of his quotes. No, I do not have it available. I saw that an interview is to be or has been published in Wirtschaftswoche and I can say the Treaty states that the ESCB is responsible for its own external representation. That is explicit in the Treaty. And everybody should know that. And I think everybody knows that, including the President of the Eurogroup. We are closely monitoring it, but it is mainly being done by the European Commission who provides the Ministers and us with a monthly update, a monthly report on the state of preparedness of the various business sectors. We have the impression that where it was slow in the beginning that one is catching up. It is a Eurosystem campaign ... Questions: right... So it will be on national government material as well to promote the euro? I do not know whether it will be on government material but it will be on central bank material... Körber: This is the slogan of the campaign of the Eurosystem. And this slogan, I think it is clear, belongs to this campaign. Again, this is not a promotion campaign, it is an information campaign which runs under the slogan, ""the euro - our money"". Körber: We would not like to interfere with governments' and other bodies' campaigns. I would say, I would like it. "
01/02/2001,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our first press conference of 2001. The Vice-President and I are here to report, as we have done for more than two years now, on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the Eurogroup President, Minister Reynders, as well as by Commissioner Solbes. Let me also take this opportunity to again welcome Greece as the twelfth country to join the euro area. Mr. Papademos, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, has been participating in our meetings as a member of the Governing Council since 1 January 2001. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The decision to keep interest rates unchanged reflects the Governing Council's assessment that the risks to price stability in the medium term now appear more balanced than at the end of last year. Factors which might pose upward risks to price stability in the medium term are still present and as such will be subject to ongoing close monitoring. Let me elaborate on this assessment. Starting with the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, monetary data for December 2000 confirmed the gradual moderation of the growth of monetary aggregates which has been observed since the spring of last year. According to the latest data, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 in the months from October to December 2000 stood at 5.0%, which was slightly lower than the average of 5.1% recorded for the period from September to November 2000. Therefore, after the recent slowdown in monetary growth, the risks to price stability from the monetary side have become increasingly balanced. Caution still needs to be exercised, however, given the continued dynamics in credit growth to the private sector and the upward deviation of M3 from the reference value in the past. Turning to the examination under the second pillar, broadly similar indications are emerging, as inflationary impulses resulting from previous developments in oil prices and the external value of the euro are gradually diminishing. As regards economic activity, uncertainty concerning the external environment for the euro area has increased, mainly related to signals that the slowdown in growth in the United States may be more significant than earlier expected. This is likely to result, directly and via a spillover to other regions, in some deceleration of growth in the world economy. World real GDP growth, which in 2000 posted its strongest performance for many years, may therefore moderate in 2001 but will still remain at an acceptable level. This deceleration will clearly have some dampening effects on euro area net exports. The euro area is a large economy where exports of goods and services amount to around 17% of GDP only. Economic activity in the euro area is therefore determined mainly by domestic factors. Overall, the fundamentals of the euro area remain broadly favourable. While, as recently published data show, real GDP growth slowed somewhat in the second half of last year, the level of business and household confidence has remained high, supported by, inter alia, high degrees of capacity utilisation and ongoing unemployment declines. Moreover, real income in the private sector will benefit from lower oil prices and from the reductions in direct taxes in 2001. Hence, while downside risks to real GDP growth exist, growth is very likely to continue at a reasonably robust pace. Developments in the euro area bond markets are in line with this outlook for economic activity. Moreover, inflationary expectations implied by bond yields confirm that the financial markets expect current levels of consumer price inflation to be temporary, and price stability to be maintained in the medium term. This assessment may also have been reinforced by the recent moderation in oil prices and the movement of the euro exchange rate in the period since the end of October 2000. Lower oil prices and the appreciation of the euro have already produced some effects on price developments. In December 2000 the annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) declined to 2.6%, from 2.9% in November. A confirmation of recent developments in oil prices and the euro exchange rate would contribute to a further downward adjustment of overall HICP inflation in the period ahead. Over the near term, this process may be slowed down by the delayed impact of past import price increases and possibly also by some transitory further food price rises caused by the current health issues associated with beef consumption. It may therefore take some time for HICP inflation to move back below 2%. Notwithstanding the assessment that the risks to price stability are now more balanced, there are still factors posing upside risks which therefore require continued attention. These are mainly related to potential second-round effects on wages of the past increases in import prices, as well as to bottlenecks and shortages in labour markets. For the medium term, it remains paramount that wage developments remain moderate. In addition, it is crucial that structural adjustments continue. This requires sustained labour market reforms, continuing liberalisation of product markets and further integration in the financial services sector, all of which will expand economic activity and increase employment. It is equally important that further progress be achieved in the area of fiscal policy reform, with continuing progress in fiscal consolidation through limits in public spending growth, allowing both a reduction in remaining budget deficits and an alleviation of the fiscal burden on corporations and households without threatening or slowing the progress in fiscal consolidation. Overall, the existence of the euro and the single monetary policy has provided the euro area with an institutional setting which leaves it significantly less exposed to external influences. Within the euro area the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, together with further progress on structural reforms, will provide an important contribution to the achievement of sustained non-inflationary economic growth and will thereby also support a further solid and sustainable expansion of the world economy. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about other issues decided by the Governing Council. The Governing Council has adopted a set of standards, recently endorsed by the G10 Governors, as the minimum standards of the Eurosystem's common oversight policy on payment systems. The Eurosystem will assess all systemically important payment systems in the euro area against these ""Core Principles"" and will make the results of its assessments available to the public. Concerning issues relating to euro banknotes and coins, I should also like to provide you with the following information. First, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Guideline on the 2002 cash changeover. Owing to the crucial importance of this matter, and given the responsibility of the Eurosystem as a whole in achieving a smooth cash changeover, a legal framework has been established. The Guideline will enable all those involved to become familiar with the basic rules to be followed in preparing for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. This ECB Guideline will be published today on the ECB's website and shortly in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Second, yesterday evening the members of the Governing Council were given a presentation by Publicis, the communication agency selected to assist in conducting the Eurosystem's Euro 2002 Information Campaign, on the current status of the campaign. This focused in particular on the creative concept of the mass media campaign, which will start in September 2001. A website dedicated to the Euro 2002 Information Campaign has now been launched in all 11 official languages of the European Community (www.euro.ecb.int). The website currently contains a section on the euro banknotes and coins. Further sections will be added over the next two weeks to help specialist groups and the general public to prepare for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. These sections will be updated throughout the year. We are now at your disposal for questions. For the foreseeable future, I cannot answer. We need more information about actual developments on which to base future decisions. For the time being, in the words used by the IMF in its final statement of the day before yesterday, which will be published shortly, we are well advised to adopt an attitude of ""wait and see"". The forecasts we published in December were based on so-called exogenous data, dating back to October and further. In the meantime, the environment has changed: the exchange rate has appreciated, oil prices have dropped. This, of course, will lead us to reassess the outlook for the future. In as far as we already have results of such reassessments available internally at the ECB, we expect that the period of robust economic growth - i.e. growth in excess of what we would call long-term potential economic growth - will remain on the cards, so to speak. We still expect a rate of growth within the range published, i.e. - to be more precise - close to a level of 3% both in 2001 and in 2002. Well, we have not addressed this question very specifically at our meeting today. But, in general, what we are looking at, of course, is not so much the cyclical developments which may influence decisions on budgets as primarily the structural developments which are desired. The structural development desired is to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact. And that is the solemn oath: achieving a situation of budgetary balance or even a small surplus over the medium term in all euro area countries. In that respect, everything is not equal for all countries, but we continue to insist that political endeavour to achieve that situation should remain intact and we believe that that is not the case in all the countries we are observing. I am not part of the decision-making body which issued this recommendation to the Irish Government. I believe that, although it is true - as you say - that Ireland is without doubt the most, or at least one of the most successful economies in the euro area, the budgetary plans of the Irish Government were clearly out of line with the broad guidelines they had agreed to earlier. And so I do have - if may I say so - full understanding for the judgement that has been reached and formulated, be it in very difficult circumstances. I think that with your second question you have really answered your first question. It was not that difficult today to make our minds up at all. And I do want to reiterate that we do not have an exchange rate target. We only have one target, and that is to maintain internal price stability. I have no competence to make judgements on the Irish budget specifically. That is for the Council of Ministers and I am not going to comment on individual countries. If the tone of my statement today is perceived by you as you describe (as being more neutral) then apparently we have managed to strike the right tone. And you know that we never disclose the voting behaviour in the Governing Council. I can only say that it was not necessary to take a vote. The second question first. I do not comment on the decisions made by other central banks. Now, as far as this central bank is concerned, I do want to emphasise, or rather re-emphasise, that we base our monetary policy decisions on an analysis of both monetary and other economic developments inside and outside the euro area. I also want to re-emphasise - as I said in my introductory statement - that the impact of events outside the euro area is of a rather limited significance to the euro area, the euro area being much more of a closed economy than its constituent parts used to be in the past. So the impact of developments outside the euro area is thereby, by definition, already rather limited. Thus I would now like to rephrase the first part of my answer, adding that our analysis is purely based on the development of internal monetary aggregates and a wide range of data relating to both inside and outside the euro area. In other words: we make our own decisions. To take measures less pro-cyclical than the measures that had been taken. No. We are speaking with a single voice, that is true. This applies both to the members of the Governing Council and, in particular, to the members of the Eurogroup, the Ministers of Finance, and we will make every effort to continue to do that in the future. And, as far as the statement of the G7 to be issued in Palermo later this month is concerned, I cannot say at this moment what that statement will include. It will have to be a statement that has been agreed by the participating members of the G7, which - in this case - will include the European Central Bank and the President of the Eurogroup. But you can be sure that we will have a press conference in Palermo, Mr. Reynders, Mr. Solbes and myself together. My answer is the same as in the past: on interventions, I will take no questions. If they occur, we will tell you afterwards. I have to repeat that the exchange rate is not a target for us in our policy decisions. Therefore, the exchange rate - as the German Minister of Finance said today - is the outcome of market forces. In the past, last year of course, it was true that we had come to the judgement that the movement of the exchange rate had clearly gone too far out of line with the fundamentals to be tolerated much longer. That was reason for us in October and subsequently to intervene in the markets. That also happened to have been - as we can see now - the turning-point in the movement of the exchange rate. Well I would point out that, first of all, we take a forward look at the likely development of inflation. We do know that inflation, be it temporarily, is still well above the value we defined as the maximum permissible level. We are seeing that monetary developments are gradually moderating, but that does not point to tight monetary conditions. May I say that, month after month, the growth of credit to the private sector is in the neighbourhood of 10%, so we do still regard monetary conditions as quite adequate for the present state of the economy. So I do not share the judgement that, over time, we have permitted a tightening of monetary conditions to become apparent. I said in an answer to a previous question close to 3%. And that means I expect it to be closer to 3% than to the 2.5% you mentioned. Question (translation): Did the ECB Governing Council talk about the German proposal to have an overall financial supervisory authority established, that is to say, to take banking supervisory authority away from the Bundesbank and to create an independent institution that would be in charge of overall oversight? What is the consensus of the Governing Council on this matter? And how do you view a situation in which banking supervision is less within the realms of monetary policy than it has been so far? During our meeting of today? Of course, the plans as unveiled last week by the German Minister of Finance are only plans. There is no draft law yet available. To the extent, however, that the authority for supervision would be taken further away from the national central banks - this is one aspect of the plans - if true, this would be of the greatest possible concern to all central banks, including the European Central Bank. Let me say why this is true for the European Central Bank. As you know, we have in the Treaty a rather limited mandate in the field of banking supervision, namely, our mandate says that we have to promote the proper functioning of banking supervision. It goes without saying that, to fulfil that mandate and also the mandate to guarantee financial stability in the system in practice, it is much easier if the ties between supervision and the central bank - and here I mean the national central banks, which are our natural channel of communication to the markets - are as close as possible. There can be various models for that, for example by having supervision totally integrated within the central bank, as is the case in some countries in the euro area, or by having a close symbiosis between supervisory tasks and the central bank, as for example is the case in France, where the ""Commission bancaire"", which is the supervisory agency, is chaired by the governor of the central bank and the staff of the supervisory agency are on the wage bill of the central bank. That is a model that at least I - I believe I can say ""we"" - would greatly prefer over the model that is now being suggested in this country - if it is all true - of severing the ties between supervision and central banking. But I also understand that the latest news about this issue is that ties apparently will not be totally severed. Yet it is a matter of gravest concern to all central bankers present in today's meeting, including this one. Question (translation): Greece is the youngest member of European Monetary Union. Can you already make an initial assessment of its entry? And what do you think the Greek Government would have to do in future to make sure that the position of Greece within Monetary Union can be further strengthened? Like any country, they have to see to it that the achievement of the convergence criteria, in which they have been successful and which has led to their admission into the euro area, continues on a sustainable basis. Or as you would say in German, the developments have to be ""nachhaltig"". "
