Date,President,Text
1998-12-22,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank at which we took the opportunity to finalise a number of issues of a rather technical or legal nature ahead of the forthcoming Changeover Weekend. Let me first turn to the Governing Council's discussion on recent economic, monetary and financial developments and the decisions that the Governing Council has taken today in the field of monetary policy. On 1 January 1999 the ESCB will assume responsibility for defining and implementing the single monetary policy of the euro area. The Governing Council of the ECB deemed it appropriate to announce in advance the interest rates that will apply to the monetary policy instruments of the ESCB as from the start of Stage Three. This should eliminate any remaining uncertainties about the monetary policy stance of the ESCB and contribute to a smooth changeover to Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. As you have already been informed, the following decisions were taken: First, the Governing Council decided to conduct the first main refinancing operation of the ESCB as a fixed rate tender and to set the level of the interest rate for this operation at 3%, in line with the key central bank rates prevailing at the end of Stage Two. This operation will be initiated on 4 January 1999, the allotment decision will be taken on 5 January 1999, and the settlement will take place on 7 January 1999. The first longer-term refinancing operation will be announced on 12 January. The Governing Council today already decided that it will be conducted through the single variable rate auction procedure. Second, with respect to the interest rates on the ESCB's standing facilities, which are designed to form a corridor for movements in short-term money market rates, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate for the marginal lending facility will be set at a level of 4.50% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2%. These are the rates of the ESCB's standing facilities at the start of Stage Three, i.e. 1 January 1999. Third, however, as a transitory measure, between 4 January and 21 January, the interest rate for the marginal lending facility will be set at a level of 3.25% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2.75%. This exceptional narrow corridor, of 50 basis points, between the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility aims at smoothing the adaptation of market participants to the integrated euro money market during the initial days of Monetary Union. The maintenance of such a narrow corridor is not desirable beyond the short term, since it would hamper the development of an efficient euro area money market. Therefore, the Governing Council intends to terminate this measure following its meeting on 21 January 1999. In summary, let me provide the following explanations for these decisions. I will start with issues related to the narrow corridor; thereafter, I will comment on the level of the interest rates. With respect to the interest rates on the ESCB's standing facilities, which are designed to form a corridor for movements in short-term money market rates, the Governing Council had to consider two aspects. First, it needed to signal clearly its monetary policy intentions. These were expressed by setting the rate for the marginal lending facility at 4.50% and the rate for the deposit facility at 2% for the start of Stage Three. Hence, the corridor for movements in short-term interest rates is asymmetric towards the upper boundary. Determining these rates was also necessary in order to provide successors to the official national central bank rates previously used as reference rates in certain legislation and contracts in some Member States. Second, however, the Governing Council also had to consider the possibility that market participants may need some time to get used to the new environment for monetary policy. In principle, cross-country deviations of short-term interest rates will not exist in Stage Three, as intra euro area arbitrage should be expected to prevent this. However, the many novelties related to the changeover make it difficult to foresee whether the euro area money market will indeed work in a fully integrated way immediately from the very first day of Stage Three. For this reason, the Governing Council has decided to use a relatively narrow corridor of interest rates on the standing facilities of the ESCB in the first three weeks of Stage Three as an automatic device to reduce the maximum range of fluctuations in the overnight interest rate. Accordingly, we have temporarily designed an exceptional corridor of only 50 basis points, with the interest rate for the marginal lending facility at 3.25% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at 2.75% which we intend to terminate on 21 January 1999. Concerning the decision to set the level of the interest rate for the first main refinancing operation of the ESCB at 3%, it may be recalled that on 3 December 1998, in a co-ordinated decision, all national central banks participating in the single monetary policy lowered their key interest rates to 3% (with the exception of the Banca d'Italia, which reduced the discount rate to 3.5%). As explained by the ECB at that time, this joint reduction had to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the ESCB will start Stage Three and which it intended to maintain for the foreseeable future. It was based on the common assessment that these interest rate reductions are in line with maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. In this connection, it is to be pointed out that a rate of 3% is very low by historical standards. This should be seen as clear indication that the ESCB does not want to give any signal for a further easing in the foreseeable future. At today's meeting, taking account of the latest monetary, financial and economic data, the Governing Council confirmed these views. At this juncture, there are no signs to suggest either that current rates of increase in the HICP of around 1% would decelerate significantly, or, conversely, accelerate to levels which are inconsistent with the definition of price stability provided by the ESCB in October 1998. Let me provide you with a more detailed record of our assessment. The information coming from the data on monetary aggregates signals a relatively smooth path for M3 growth in 1998, compatible with continued price stability. In particular, the latest three-month moving average annual growth rate of M3 stood at around 4.5%. This was exactly in line with the reference value set by the Governing Council at its last meeting. With respect to the other pillar of the ESCB's monetary policy strategy, the broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and risks to price stability, various indicators confirm the assessment of developments in monetary data. The further reduction of long-term interest rates by almost 20 basis points since the end of November to a level of 3.9% on 21 December, as well as the downward shift in the yield curve, can be regarded as a sign that markets expect the environment of price stability to continue. From the point of view of the Governing Council, it is an encouraging signal that financial market participants are apparently prepared to attribute a credibility bonus to our stability-oriented monetary policy shortly before its official start. At the current juncture, the outlook for the euro area economy is still very much influenced by the uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the world economy in 1999. These uncertainties have affected negatively indicators of industrial confidence in the euro area and have fuelled expectations of a slowdown in economic activity in the short term. Very recently, a first estimate of real GDP growth in the euro area in the third quarter of 1998 has been released by EUROSTAT, suggesting a growth rate of 2.4% against the third quarter of 1997. This would be around one-half of a percentage point lower than the average growth rate of 3% in the first half of 1998, compared with the first half of 1997. Other indicators of real activity were mixed up to November. While order books and capacity utilisation point to a less optimistic assessment of growth prospects, consumer confidence remained high and retail sales continued to increase at a broadly stable pace up to September, i.e. the latest month for which data are available. Also, the decline in unemployment, after having paused in the summer months, resumed, with the rate of unemployment decreasing from 10.9% in September to 10.8% in October. The factors underpinning the currently low increases in the HICP continued to include falling energy prices, downward movements in producer prices, subdued wage growth and slight decreases in unit labour costs. On balance, the overall environment described above does not point to significant upward or downward pressure on prices in the short term, as also reflected in all available forecasts for 1999. Nevertheless, factors contributing to risks to price stability on both sides need to be taken into account. On the one hand, downward risks relate to the global environment and potential repercussions on the euro area, for example via import prices and further pressure on producer prices. These developments will be monitored closely. On the other hand, unexpected upward pressure on wages and a relaxation of the fiscal stance would clearly alter the general environment. Therefore, we will also carefully monitor the outcome of ongoing wage rounds, the plans for fiscal policy in 1999 and over the medium term, as well as their implementation towards compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. In conclusion, the actual situation, characterised by monetary growth compatible with continued price stability and the absence of immediate upward or downward pressure on prices, justifies maintaining the current stance of monetary policy, with an ECB interest rate of 3% for the main refinancing facility. As we indicated in the ECB press release of 3 December 1998, the intention was also to maintain this rate ""for the foreseeable future"". Indeed, monetary policy in Stage Three starts with interest rates which are very low by historical standards. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to report on various aspects of the final preparatory work for Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. Preparations for the changeover to the single currency On 11 December 1998 the ECB issued a press release on the practical issues relating to the forthcoming Changeover Weekend as a follow-up to the information provided in the press release issued on 3 November 1998. At its meeting today, the Governing Council took stock of the state of the preparations of the ECB and of the national central banks and took note of the very detailed planning which has been co-ordinated by the special Changeover Weekend Committee which the Governing Council set up in November. The Governing Council also took note of the outcome of the recent ""dress rehearsal"", which had simulated the full operational activity of the ESCB using normal systems and procedures and, if they were to fail, contingency procedures. In line with the announcement made in the Joint Communiqué issued on 2 May 1998 - by the Ministers of the Member States adopting the euro as their single currency, the Governors of the central banks of those Member States, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute - the Governing Council reconfirmed today that appropriate market techniques would be used to ensure that on 31 December 1998 the market exchange rates, recorded during the teleconference held between 11 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. (C.E.T.) and used for calculating the daily exchange rates of the official ECU will be equal to the ERM bilateral central rates. These bilateral central rates were published in the Joint Communiqué in the form of a parity grid. The ECB has also been involved in the testing of the procedures to be applied to the fixing of the irrevocable euro conversion rates so as to minimise the likelihood that technical problems might arise on 31 December 1998. As part of the process of fixing these rates, the Governing Council - in consultation with the General Council of the ECB - will adopt by special teleconference its formal Opinion on a proposal from the European Commission, which the ECB President will deliver personally to the specially convened session of the Council of the European Union in Brussels in the early afternoon of 31 December 1998. The ECB and the NCBs will contribute to the efforts to publicise the information on the irrevocable euro conversion rates by publishing them on their respective web sites. Contemporaneously, the ECB will send a S.W.I.F.T. broadcast message to the whole banking community in the world to confirm the rates of the eleven currencies against the euro. The Governing Council agreed that, as of 1 January 1999, the ECB will fully change over to the euro. As a consequence, the staff of the ECB will be remunerated in euro with effect from that date. EONIA The Governing Council took stock of the final preparations being made for the calculation of the Euro OverNight Indexed Average interest rate - to be more simply known as EONIA. This will be calculated on the basis of data supplied by a panel of banks in the European Union. The EONIA will be published each day, starting on Monday, 4 January 1999. The authority of the ECB concerning the issuance of national banknotes With the start of Stage Three, banknotes and coins denominated in the national currencies of the eleven participating Member States will become sub-divisions of the euro from that date onwards. Although euro banknotes and coins will not be put into circulation until 1 January 2002, from 1 January 1999 the right to authorise the issue of national banknotes - and the right to approve the volume of national coins to be issued - will belong to the Governing Council of the ECB. With regard to the issue of national banknotes during the three years until euro banknotes are put into circulation, the Governing Council agreed today to develop a set of common procedures by the spring of 1999 to be followed by the participating national central banks when requesting authorisation to issue national banknotes. Similarly, on an annual basis, the national central banks will submit estimates to the ECB of the volume of national coins to be issued. Logistics of the 2002 cash changeover In connection with the preparations for the 2002 cash changeover, the Governing Council addressed the issue of ""front-loading"", i.e. the distribution of euro banknotes and coins prior to 1 January 2002 to certain target groups. A final decision will be taken in the first week of 1999. 1998 Annual Report and the ECB's first Monthly Bulletin The Governing Council agreed that the 1998 Annual Report covering the first six months of the life of the ECB and the transition from the EMI will be released to the media on Thursday, 15 April 1999. It was also agreed to release the ECB's first Monthly Bulletin on Tuesday, 19 January 1999. Swap agreements with the Federal Reserve System and Norges Bank The Governing Council took the opportunity of the forthcoming introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 to review and adjust existing swap agreements between euro area central banks, on the one hand, and the Federal Reserve System and Norges Bank, on the other hand. First, the Governing Council jointly agreed with the Federal Reserve System that the existing bilateral agreements of six euro area national central banks - namely, the central banks of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria - with the Federal Reserve System will be allowed to lapse as they expire. Second, the current swap agreements between euro area national central banks and Norges Bank will be replaced by a new swap agreement between the ECB and Norges Bank amounting to E1,535 million as from 1 January 1999. ECB budget for 1999 The Governing Council approved the ECB's budget for 1999, which gives the ECB the green light to recruit around 150 additional staff (both permanent and temporary) needed to support the new operational activities which the ECB will take on from 1 January 1999. This will bring the ECB's permanent staff to around 700, with nearly 50 limited contract staff. We stand ready to take any questions you might have. No, that is not a signal that it is supposed to give. The only signal that we do want to give is - and I cannot state it more clearly than I do now - is that markets do not expect a change in interest rates in the foreseeable future. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, you said that as from 3 December all central banks have a key interest rate of 3% apart from the Banca d'Italia. Do you mean that on the basis of today's decision the Banca d'Italia should lower its discount rate or could it in principle continue like this until 31 December? Duisenberg:Theoretically, yes; but in any case it is a matter that is entirely up to the Banca d'Italia to decide. It remains fully autonomous until 31 December of this year. My position is one of ""wait-and-see"" because I was not involved in it; and we shall wait until we see the ""employment pact ""- as I believe it is called - in the course of the next six months. Question (translation): There is a certain number of economies who are a little fearful of the start to the euro because they fear that it might make them less competitive in the short and medium term. How do you view this and what do you think the influence is going to be on the problems in Asia and those under pressure from the crisis in Asia? Noyer (translation): I assume that your question is really aimed at a potential upward pressure which the euro might suffer from at the beginning of next year. Well, I confess that we have no particular reason to think that that would happen. Consequently we have to wait and see what happens on the exchange markets. That depends mainly upon market forces; and there is absolutely no reason to believe there will be a sudden upward pressure, a sudden upward appreciation, in the value of the euro. In any case we have always said that we are looking for a sound, stable euro and of course we also hope that the other leading currencies, in particular the US dollar, will also be stable, sound currencies and remain as stable as possible. I can't really say anything more than that. As I already stated in my introductory remarks, we see at the present time no signals either for inflation to move downwards, nor for it to move in an upward direction. So, your question precisely was: would you agree on that? The answer is: I don't agree. That would depend on the size. But we would, of course, try to counter such a very rapid movement into the euro to the extent possible. The reference value is meant for the medium term; it is not meant to be changed rather quickly. We have said we will reassess the validity of the reference value in December next year. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, I wanted to ask about this asymmetric corridor. I didn't quite understand what you said, perhaps. Why have you opted for an asymmetric corridor if your purpose was not to say that the inclination of the ECB would be in a particular direction? The basic decision, really, is to make it a band of 250 basis points. That cannot always be placed precisely around the current repo rate. Although we intend to maintain it for the foreseeable future, at some time it will be changed, that is sure. There will come a moment in time when the repo rate may be changed and then the symmetry would have been lost anyway. So we do not give so much prominence to the idea of symmetry around a rate which is set every two weeks. And if - at any rate - you were to interpret it as a move which would signal that markets should not expect a further easing of monetary policy in the near future, then that interpretation would not be unwelcome to us. Question (translation): Mr. President, we are still learning, and that's why I'm asking you the question. Are there reasons - other than inflation in the conjuncture - why interest rates might rise? If, for example, too much money were to flow from Europe to the United States where interest rates are higher? Could that in given circumstances be a reason? I'm asking the question because we are still learning. The earlier question pointed in the opposite direction - i.e. that money would flow to Europe rather than the other way around. If it were to flow away, because interest rates elsewhere were more attractive and given the risks for the exchange rate that would go along with that, then it could happen that at some point there would be repercussions on the growth rate of the monetary aggregate. And if it were also to have an impact on other economic valuables, then that could lead to a reaction in monetary policy. But I cannot indicate when, where and how much. My advice (if I am permitted to give advice to governments, and if I am not permitted, I will give it anyway) is to stick to their policies as they have outlined them themselves in the Stability and Growth Pact: that is, to continue to exude an image of continuity and stability and the political impetus to achieve - over the medium term - balanced budgets or even a small surplus; and what I would advise governments to do is to inspire that feeling of continuity and stability sooner rather than later. Well, we do not think about the exchange rates of the big currencies in the world in terms of competition. What we do hope and are after is that the euro will be a stable currency, more than anything else. Stability in the first place that it will be a currency characterised by price stability in the entire euro area and, as a result, then we would hope that it would also be a stable currency in its external relations, that is vis-à-vis the dollar and the yen in particular. Well, as I said, it is the strong intention of the Governing Council to terminate this narrow band on 21 January. We think at the moment that a three-week period for markets to get used to the new environment and to become full players in the new game is enough. So we do not envisage that the period will be longer. No, we strongly intend to terminate this narrow band after three weeks. To totally exclude that it might be longer of course we can not do. No, we have not discussed that, and I would also expect the national central banks, also in the last four working days of this year, the transition period, to stay calm. Well, the euro is being launched as far as Europe is concerned under optimal economic conditions. We would have been pleased if the international environment had been a little bit calmer than it has been over the past three to four months, but that by itself has not at all perturbed the process of the changeover. On the contrary, as I have repeatedly said, it is remarkable - and we are grateful for that - the extent to which the international turmoil has had no impact whatsoever on exchange rate developments inside the euro area and interest rate developments inside the euro area. The Monthly Bulletin will certainly contain the first time and every month thereafter an assessment of the current economic situation, similar to the one I have given to you in my introductory statement of today. The publication date of the Monthly Bulletin will be announced in a relatively short period from now, when we have finalised our schedule. The Monthly Bulletin will be complemented of course by the weekly publication of a consolidated balance sheet for the entire European System of Central Banks and then, in addition, we will publish new data when they become available; for the monetary aggregate, for example, this will be every month. We will publish them separately. I would deny that with all the force I have in me. As I have explained, as far as the co-ordinated reduction in key interest rates to 3% is concerned, I would rather be inclined to expect that it would be regarded as a remarkable consensus among the European national central banks, even weeks ahead of their obligatory consensus, which will start on 1 January 1999. In this connection, I almost have a counterquestion: as regards the so-called lack of transparency, don't you mean, rather, that it was so totally unexpected by the markets and the media? And that that is what is now being called a lack of transparency. We are rather pleased about the unexpectedness of the move. "
1998-12-01,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the Governing Council and the General Council of the European Central Bank. Similarly to last month, the Governing Council had a very heavy agenda with many of the items being of a rather technical nature or related to the legal implementation of decisions already taken at previous meetings. Let me first turn to the Governing Council's in-depth discussion on recent economic, monetary and financial developments. Today the Governing Council focused, inter alia, on various projections available for the world economy and the euro area. This material pointed unequivocally to some deceleration of real GDP growth in the euro area in 1999, compared with the widely expected growth rate of just below 3% in 1998. In addition, the Governing Council took note of the apparently calmer conditions in world financial markets in November this year. A key feature has been the diminished volatility in financial markets. However, the Governing Council pointed out that caution is warranted when interpreting the most recent developments and the projections available. Indeed, downward risks continue to exist. In the view of the Governing Council, apart from global developments, the most significant risk for all forecasts is that confidence within the euro area and thereby domestic demand could be negatively affected. Confidence in the corporate sector has already declined. In this respect, the Governing Council emphasised the utmost importance of maintaining a sound and sustainable policy framework within the euro area, particularly in the interest of supporting confidence. This framework is characterised by the maintenance of a stability-oriented monetary policy, a conduct of fiscal policies which is consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact, and ongoing structural reforms in the labour and product markets, accompanied by continued wage moderation. Maintaining this policy framework will help to foster competitiveness and profitability in the corporate sector, thereby promoting investment. Equally, it will help to sustain and foster the employment growth that has been seen recently, thereby supporting private consumption. Against this background, the Governing Council discussed in depth issues related to the conduct of monetary policy for the euro area. Let me elaborate on that discussion, which further prepared the ground for the setting of interest rates for the euro area. In the context of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, the main elements of which were announced in October this year, the Governing Council agreed on the quantitative reference value for monetary growth and the monetary aggregate to which it applies. Moreover, the Governing Council carefully analysed the data on monetary developments and made a thorough examination of the broad outlook for price stability. The first reference value for monetary growth decided by the Governing Council, which plays a prominent role in the Governing Council's monetary policy assessment, will apply to the broad monetary aggregate M3 and has been set at an annual rate of 4 1/2%; it will be reviewed in December 1999. This rate is consistent with the maintenance of price stability according to the ESCB's published definition, while allowing for sustainable output growth. It has been derived by assuming that the trend growth rate of real GDP in the euro area is in the range of 2% to 2 1/2% per annum and the velocity of circulation of M3 declines at a trend rate of between 1/2% and 1% each year. Further details related to the derivation of the reference rate and the definition of the broad aggregate M3 are described in a separate press statement to be released today. With regard to the reference value, let me stress two points very clearly. First, the reference value for M3 growth has been derived in an explicit medium-term context, in line with the ESCB's monetary policy strategy. Analysis of monetary developments relative to the reference value will provide a firm anchor for the conduct of the stability-oriented single monetary policy. Second, the ESCB's monetary policy strategy does not entail ""mechanistic"" policy reactions to deviations of monetary growth from the announced reference value. In the first instance, deviations of monetary growth will be analysed thoroughly, in parallel with the broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments. Preliminary estimates for part of the euro area indicate that the average of the 12-month growth rates for the last three months (including October) was around 4.5%. Taking a medium-term perspective, the Governing Council took note of the fact that over the last two years the annual rate of M3 growth has constantly fluctuated in a range of 3.5% to 5.5%. It was concluded that this monetary trend appears to be broadly compatible with continued price stability in the euro area. In line with the ESCB's monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council will closely monitor developments in M3 in relation to the reference value. As regards other financial indicators, average long-term interest rates in the euro area declined slightly in November to 4.15%. The decline in long-term interest rates, which has been substantial since June this year, is consistent with the view that markets currently have low inflation expectations. The discussion on the appropriate interest rates for the start of Stage Three was further deepened during the deliberations of the members of the Governing Council on the broad outlook for price stability in the euro area. Prospects for price developments are generally seen as favourable as the rate of increase in the HICP, which stood at 1.0% in October, is expected to remain below 2% in the foreseeable future. However, this is conditional on import prices remaining subdued and wage developments continuing to be moderate. In the same context, the Governing Council emphasised once again that budgetary positions are still far from being close to balance or in surplus, while debt ratios are still at a very high level. All the members of the Governing Council agreed that any tendency to relax the fiscal stance or to alter the strategy enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact would risk endangering the credibility of the euro and the objective of price stability. On balance, the outlook for price stability was judged favourably by the Governing Council. In an environment of substantial uncertainty, monetary policy will be guided by a continuous convergence of central bank interest rates towards the level considered to be appropriate for the monetary, financial and economic situation prevailing at the start of Stage Three. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to report on various aspects of the preparatory work for Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. (1) Revision of the key for the capital of the European Central Bank (ECB) Revised GDP data, which are used to calculate the key for the capital of the European Central Bank, have been received from the Commission of the European Communities. When the revisions are applied to the calculation of the capital key, variations of more than 0.01% occur. Article 2 of the original Decision of the Governing Council of the ECB of 9 June 1998 (ECB/1998/1) states that should revisions received before December 1998 result in variations of this magnitude, the key for the capital of the ECB may be revised. The General Council and the Governing Council have therefore considered and agreed to an adjustment of the key and the Governing Council has adopted the related ECB Decision. Details of the adjusted shares of the national central banks (NCBs) are presented in a separate press release which is to be issued this evening. Today, also in this connection, the General Council adopted an ECB Decision on the contribution of the non-euro area national central banks to the capital of the ECB, for which the adjustment of the key has knock-on implications. The Decision states that the non-euro area NCBs will pay up 5% of their subscriptions to the capital of the ECB. However, the four NCBs concerned will not actually be asked to pay their share since the amounts due are less than they can expect to receive as their share in the proceeds of the liquidation of the European Monetary Institute. These details were already agreed by the General Council at its meeting on 1 September this year and are now contained in a legally binding text. (2) National legal framework for the monetary policy instruments and procedures in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union As you are already aware, from January 1999, the single monetary policy will be defined and implemented by the decision-making bodies of the ECB, the Governing Council and the Executive Board. The operations of the monetary policy of the ESCB will be carried out in a decentralised manner by the participating NCBs. Therefore, the NCBs have prepared contractual and/or regulatory legal documentation (the national legal documentation) in order to implement the monetary policy framework of the ESCB as adopted by the Governing Council on 11 September 1998 and published in the report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"". The national legal documentation of each NCB has been assessed by legal experts from the NCBs and the ECB in order to ensure that it properly implements and complies with the monetary policy framework of the ESCB, which aims at establishing a level playing-field across the euro area. All eligible institutions wishing to access monetary policy operations and standing facilities in Stage Three should therefore contact their local NCB in order to prepare for the execution of that national legal documentation in good time before the beginning of Stage Three. (3) Regulation of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves Today the Governing Council adopted the Regulation of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves. The final specifications of the minimum reserve system to be used by the ESCB in Stage Three was the subject of a press release following the Governing Council meeting on 13 October this year. At that time it was announced that an ECB Regulation on minimum reserves would be published shortly thereafter. This commitment has now been fulfilled and the features of the ESCB's minimum reserve system are contained in a legally binding text. (4) Regulation of the European Central Bank concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector Today the Governing Council also adopted an ECB Regulation concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions (MFI) sector. The purpose of this Regulation is to enable the ECB and the NCBs to collect the statistical material required for the establishment of the consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector. The aim of this balance sheet is to provide the ECB with a comprehensive, statistical picture of monetary developments covering the aggregated financial assets and liabilities of MFIs located in the euro area. (5) Payments systems issues (i) Legal documentation for the correspondent central banking model (CCBM) The correspondent central banking model (CCBM) is a system which will enable all collateral that is eligible for ESCB monetary policy operations to be used on a cross-border basis. It is a system that relies on bilateral relations between the NCBs involved and implies, inter alia, a regime of rights and liabilities between the NCBs. There are two pieces of legal documentation involved in this issue. First, there is the so called ""CCBM Main Agreement"", which concerns the participating Member States and the ECBs, and second, there is what we call the ""Out CCBM Agreement"", which deals with the regulations for operations concerning non-participating Member States. Today, the central bank Governors of all 15 Member States and the President of the ECB signed the ""Out CCBM Agreement"" and the members of the Eurosystem signed the ""CCBM Main Agreement"", ""Eurosystem"" being the term which we now intend to use to refer to the 11 euro area NCBs and the ECB. Further details of the CCBM and information concerning the forthcoming publication of a brochure on the subject are contained in a separate press release which will be issued to you this evening. (ii) TARGET Agreement Further to the Governing Council's agreement on the main features of the legal framework for TARGET in November this year, I am pleased to be able to inform you that today the TARGET Agreement has been signed by all 15 central bank Governors and the President of the ECB, thus allowing the non-euro area NCBs to be connected to TARGET. By entering into the TARGET Agreement today, the central banks of Denmark, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom have consequently agreed to adhere to the rules and procedures referred to in the TARGET Guideline, which regulates the relationship between the ECB and all euro area central banks. Finally, it gives me pleasure to announce that the central bank Governors of these four countries have committed their NCBs to adhere to the principles laid down in the policy statement on euro payment and settlement systems located outside the euro area, which was released to you on 3 November 1998. (6) Issues relating to accounting and financial reporting Finally, today the Governing Council, having considered the observations of the General Council, adopted an ECB Guideline on the legal framework for accounting and reporting in the ESCB. This Guideline will not be published but will be available on request from the ECB. A number of other decisions were also taken regarding the consolidated weekly financial statement of the ESCB. The formats for the external reporting of the financial accounts of the ESCB were agreed. It was decided that Friday will be the reporting date of the ESCB and that publication of the weekly consolidated balance sheet will take place on the following Tuesday. Further details will be supplied when the first weekly consolidated balance sheet is published. We simply felt that the announcement of a range was more likely to be interpreted by the public at large as triggering automatic reactions than the announcement of a rate, a reference rate. We may have been wrong in that feeling, but that was our - let's say - psychological estimate of public reactions. And then I should like to point out that, if you read that press statement, you will see the reference rate given as 4 1/2%, and specifically so. For the same reason, it has not been given as 4.5%, but rather as 4 1/2%. Whether it is desirable or useful or necessary has not been discussed by the Governing Council. If you want my personal opinion, I regard it as something that will happen over time. And over time means that it could take decades, a process of tax structures starting to look more like one another, without perhaps ever becoming totally equal. I reconcile them by not defining openness as publishing everything that would be available. And that openness, by the definition of openness, is publishing, explaining every decision, every consideration, including the pros and cons. To be very open about that and to be frequent and immediate in that openness. And I think, I admit, we have been a central bank for only 5 months. I am still pretentious in thinking that, looking at our record of publications, etc., we already are the most open central bank in the world. Very preliminary forecasts for GDP growth in 1999 indicate some slowdown, compared with 1998. In 1998 we already had to lower the estimate slightly from around 3%; it would be now in all likelihood be slightly, only slightly, below 3%. Our very preliminary forecasts for 1999 indicate a range of growth in the order of 2 1/2%, and they also indicate that this slowdown might be temporary, that it might pick up somewhat later next year. But, adding to that, I think the risks, as far as we can analyse and observe them, are on the down side. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, are there any concerns which you or your colleagues have with respect to the stock of confidence in the euro, concerns which we should know about? That is my first question. It has been reported time and again - my second question - that leading policy makers in Italy, in France and in Germany are saying in small inner circles that they want to draw on central bank reserves to finance additional programmes within the scope of the European employment pact. If that were so - the first policy maker to say so was Mr. Prodi, who is no longer in office - what position would you take? With regard to the first question as to whether is there a certain concern which we have not told you about yet, the answer is ""no"". The concerns we have are implicit in the forecasts or assessments of the outlook as we see it developing in 1999. Perhaps, as I have just indicated in the answer to the previous question, there is some concern that there will be some moderation in the rate of growth and that the risks are more on the downside than on the upside. With regard to the second question, I can note that you refer to small inner circles. I was part of such a small inner circle last week, when I attended the meeting of the Ministers of Finance of the Euro-11 countries together with the Vice-President, and we did not hear any utterances or comments pointing in the direction you suggested. On the contrary, we heard a re-confirmation by the Ministers of Finance of their will to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact. They will feel as excited as I feel around the year-end. I do not know how they will feel. What we hope to inspire is that they, approaching that day and from that day onwards, look to the future with confidence, confidence in their own future and confidence in the European Central Bank. With regard to the uncertainties surrounding the changeover, the structure, they pertain not only to the development of the money supply, but to one thing in particular, i.e. also to the velocity of the circulation of money. The reference value, as I told you in my introductory remarks, has to be seen as the summing up or the addition of the trend rate of growth of the euro economy, which we estimate at between 2 and 2.5%, and with respect to which we have emphasised that, if the process of adjustment or change in the supply factors on the labour market structural policies were to continue, one could have a higher trend rate of growth. But this trend rate is based on past experience, with all the rigidities that were there. Then we have the trend value for prices which is defined as the rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), a rate below 2%. And, finally, on the velocity of circulation, we are also not quite certain about it. We estimate that the velocity of circulation is on a slightly downward trend of between one-half and one percentage point per year. Now, it is quite uncertain how the transition to the euro will in itself affect behavioural relations. And, in particular, more than you suggested regarding the money supply, it is quite uncertain what it will do to the velocity of circulation of money. So, we cannot do anything but assume that the trends in all three areas - the money supply, prices and velocity - will broadly continue in the future. That altogether forms the basis for our reference value, but it also forms the justification for calling it a reference value, rather than a target which it specifically is not. In practice, deviations of actual figures from the reference value over the medium term will also be evaluated and judged and can lead - but will not necessarily mechanistically lead - to monetary policy decisions. Question (translation): Mr. President, in one month's time the European Central Bank will begin to use its powers. Some economic analysts say that you will then be the world's most powerful man in the economic field. Some European governments actually fear that happening. How will you respond? Well, I have never regarded Mr. Greenspan as the most important or powerful man in the world and neither do I regard myself - or the European Central Bank, for that matter - as, in qualitative terms, the most important man or institution in the world. We do recognise that, through our measures and through our attitude, we will have an important impact on the economic climate in the euro area. That is, I think that, if that climate were to be one of stability, continuity and growth, then we would be very satisfied and we would be all the more satisfied, the greater the extent is to which we can contribute to creating this climate. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, what do you think of the idea of the policy mix which Oskar Lafontaine launched in discussions with his statement that employment policy always also has something to do with monetary policy? No matter which Minister brought it up, my answer, in general, is that, of course, monetary policy and fiscal policy have something to do with employment policy, but I cannot but repeat what I have always said and what is said in the Treaty, namely that the best contribution monetary policy can make to the growth of the economy and to the growth of employment is to create a stable climate. A climate of price stability is the best thing we can deliver; and to the extent that we deliver price stability, then, as the Treaty says, without prejudice to the price stability, monetary policy should and will contribute to the other economic roles as specified in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. I do see it as an important, I should say ""almost"" important, part of our role. Because if we don't urge governments to act in that way, who else will? And it is also an important part of our role because it is our task to help create the climate to do just that, and we feel not inhibited to point out that role that governments have to play on the basis of our analysis. Just as little as governments feel inhibited to point out the role the European Central Bank would have to play. We listen to one another, we hear one another, and we hope to come to the correct decision. We keep and maintain the independence by strictly adhering to our mandate which includes that we are forbidden to follow instructions or suggestions from others, just as others are forbidden even to give such instructions. Apart from that, we will never shy away from a dialogue with other responsible authorities, a dialogue concerning our and other policies. So, we do participate in Euro-11 meetings; we do invite the President of the ECOFIN Council to every meeting of the Governing Council, as the Treaty prescribes. We do answer invitations and follow up on invitations from the ECOFIN Council to attend their meetings. We do anticipate so far as it goes even that the President of the ECOFIN Council has the right not only to attend the meeting of the Governing Council, but also to submit a motion for deliberation to the Governing Council. The only right he does not have is to vote on that motion. We have not reached conclusions, but we are now only four weeks away from actually entering Stage Three. And, before we go into that, we have to set the interest rate with which we will enter Stage Three. So it is only logical that our discussion, now that the moment of truth draws nearer, is intensifying and deepening and I might say livening up. But conclusions, we are not there yet. Whenever Sweden decides to join the euro area, if it decides to do so and when it decides to do so, one thing is certain: it will have to have demonstrated beforehand, a considerable time beforehand, that its exchange rate will not have been volatile vis-à-vis the euro for a prolonged period of time. That is what will be required. Well, apart from the Bank of England being a shareholder, although they have to pay up only 5 % of that capital subscription, so I would delete the word substantial. This is my personal opinion. I would have preferred the U.K. participating in the euro area and that's a normative political opinion which I have. I cannot answer the question. I could answer the question if the date you had mentioned was 31 December and then my answer would have been that the chances are 100%. On 22 December, to my recollection, that is just before Christmas, we will have a press conference. M. Körber: Ladies and Gentlemen, I think this was a very good conclusion, because this will make sure that we meet each other here on 22 December for another prolonged winter evening, as Mr. Balkhausen put it. Thank you for coming and thank you for your patience. "
1998-11-03,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, as in previous months, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. The number of items considered by the Governing Council required a full-day meeting. Most of the items on the agenda were of a rather technical nature or were related to the legal implementation of decisions already taken at previous Governing Council meetings. Part of the meeting was attended by Mr. Edlinger, President of the EU Council, and by Commissioners de Silguy and Monti. Let me first turn to the Governing Council's in-depth discussion on recent economic, monetary and financial developments. Starting with the global macroeconomic environment, it was felt that the spiral of bad news has not continued over the most recent weeks. Also, when looking at market developments, we have observed a strengthening of the US dollar vis-à-vis euro area currencies since its trough in mid-October. We have seen a recovery in global stock markets and we have also witnessed some upward correction of long-term bond yields after they had fallen sharply as a result of a ""flight to quality"". However, markets displayed considerable volatility during the month of October, reflecting the uncertainty prevailing in the world economy Whether or not we can now expect a process towards more normal conditions remains to be seen. Given the underlying causes of the adverse conditions in Asia, Russia and other parts of the world, a quick resolution is in any case not very likely. Moreover, it is by now quite clear that the world economy will suffer from these developments in 1999 and that the euro area will also be affected to some extent. However, the crucial and widely debated issue is the degree to which such effects on the euro area will materialise and how long they may last. As matters stand, there appears to be consensus that euro area economic growth will slow down to some extent in 1999, driven largely by a weakening in net exports. In its latest forecast, published on 21 October 1998, the Commission has revised downwards aggregate euro area real GDP growth to 2.6% in 1999, compared with the increase of 3.2% projected earlier this year. According to the same source, the slowdown is expected to be only temporary and real GDP growth is anticipated to strengthen again in 2000, with the contribution of net trade improving. At the same time, the outlook for inflation in the near term remains generally favourable, assuming continued wage moderation and subdued developments in import prices. In today's discussion, the Governing Council agreed to examine further the broad outlook for the euro area at its two meetings in December. In this context, we shall thoroughly discuss the downside risks for output growth resulting from the evolution of world trade and from international financial tensions and the possibility of still more subdued price developments. However, one should also mention the fact that a relaxation of fiscal policies and higher wage increases could lead to a reversal of current developments in consumer prices and undermine confidence. Any uncertainties arising in these two fields would of course considerably complicate our assessment, given the high degree of uncertainty already associated with the developments in the global economy. With respect to today's review of the monetary, financial and macroeconomic situation in the euro area, the following aspects were discussed First, with reference to monetary growth, let me recall that when looking at various definitions of broad money, our preliminary data show broadly similar and stable annual growth rates of between 3 and 5% in 1997 and the first half of 1998. According to our initial analysis these monetary trends do not appear to signal inflationary pressures at this juncture. However, a further assessment will be made in December on the basis of more up-to-date information. Second, with respect to price developments, euro area HICP inflation fell from 1.2% in August to 1.0% in September 1998. The generally low level of HICP increases mainly reflects a decline in energy prices, which were almost 4% lower in September than a year earlier, and in other commodity prices; in addition, price pressure as indicated by industrial output prices and unit labour costs has remained modest. With respect to the decline in HICP inflation in September, this is closely related to a relatively strong fall in food prices (from 1.8% in August to 1.4% in September 1998), which account for almost one-quarter of the total HICP. Such monthly changes are certainly very difficult to interpret. However, I may point out that food prices display a larger degree of volatility owing to their seasonal pattern. Third, taking into account distorting factors such as calendar effects, underlying developments in euro area-wide real GDP have remained fairly stable. Economic expansion was broadly unchanged in the first half of 1998 from the solid growth seen in the second half of 1997. Also, at this juncture, data partly available for the summer months point to the possibility that recent rates of output growth may be broadly sustained beyond the first half of this year. While the trends appear in some cases weaker, particularly when also looking at some national data, the latest euro area-wide survey data on confidence, order books and capacity utilisation generally remain well above their long-run averages. However, further developments in these data will have to be monitored closely. Concerning the assessment of the monetary policy stance in the euro area, the Governing Council - after having carefully reviewed all factors and developments - confirmed the view taken at its previous meeting. It considered further interest rate convergence towards the lower end of the current range prevailing in the euro area as being appropriate. Measured by key central bank rates, the lowest rates in the euro area currently stand at 3.3%. Market interest rates have also reached very low levels. In terms of three-month interest rates, the euro area average rate has fallen to 3.75%, following the reduction of interest rates by a number of euro area central banks. With the announcement today of further interest rate reductions by the Banco de España and the Banco de Portugal, both effective tomorrow, the euro area average will continue its downward trend. Nominal and real long-term interest rates for the euro area are at historically low levels. It confirms the high degree of confidence that the euro has gained in the judgement of the general public and of global investors. This confidence is a major asset in the consolidation of a financial environment conducive to growth. As has been proven in many instances in the past, monetary policy cannot solve structural problems. Indeed, monetary policies in the euro area countries have increasingly converged over the past few years and resulted in low levels of interest rates. Several countries have followed virtually a ""common monetary policy stance"" over a longer period, but performances - for example in labour markets - within the euro area differ considerably from country to country. The degree of success in this area seems to be closely related to structural reforms implemented in earlier years. I am confident that we can cope both with current problems and with future challenges. This requires a forward-looking, medium-term-oriented monetary policy, which keeps inflationary expectations low. This is the decisive contribution of monetary policy to the fostering of growth and employment. Dealing with structural problems is the task of policies other than monetary policy. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to report on various aspects of the preparatory work for Stage Three. (a) Preparations for the ""changeover weekend"" With less than 60 days to go before the start of Stage Three, we are obviously attaching particular importance to the provision of a framework allowing for a smooth changeover to the euro. We began our preparations a long time ago and I am confident that the ESCB will be in a position to deliver its entire complex infrastructure to the markets by the morning of 4 January 1999. I expect the banking and financial community in the euro area to be fully aware both of the logistical challenge that the changeover weekend represents and of the need for careful preparation. Given the concentration of migration operations to the euro to be conducted by a multitude of financial agents (i.e. payment systems, securities settlement systems, custodians, individual banks, exchanges and financial information providers) in the period from 31 December 1998 to 4 January 1999, the ESCB is preparing to work together with other public authorities to orchestrate the necessary policy responses to any unexpected events. To this end, the Governing Council has set up an ad hoc ""Changeover Weekend Committee"" which will organise the monitoring of developments vis-à-vis the final migration to the euro within the ECB and the national central banks and in the banking and financial industry, both prior to and during the changeover weekend Additional details on the preparation of the changeover weekend are provided in a separate press release which is to be issued to you this evening. (b) Payment systems issues With regard to euro payment and settlement systems, I should like to draw your attention to recent developments which suggest that many market participants consider the euro as a special currency to which the traditional rules applied elsewhere in the developed world would not necessarily be applicable. Initiatives were taken, or allowed to develop, that have no precedent in the arrangements concerning other currencies. This relates in particular to the granting of payment finality and intraday credit in a currency other than a country's own. Therefore, the Governing Council considered it appropriate to issue a policy statement clearly spelling out the fact that the rules which apply to all of the other currencies in the world will also apply to the euro, and that the ECB bears the same responsibilities as all the other central banks in the world This policy statement on euro payment and settlement systems located outside the euro area is to be issued to you this evening The Governing Council also agreed on the main features of the legal framework within which the TARGET system will operate. These main features are set out in greater detail in the ""Third progress report on the TARGET project"", which the Governing Council endorsed today. In common with previous progress reports, the current one will be published in the near future and will provide further technical details of interest to market participants. (c) Exchange of national banknotes In the absence of euro banknotes at the start of Stage Three, the Governing Council today agreed on arrangements according to which the participating national central banks will exchange legal tender banknotes of other participating Member States for national banknotes and coins at the official conversion rate as from 1 January 1999. To ensure substitutability between the national currency units, the Governing Council decided that each participating national central bank will arrange for such an exchange at one location at least. The national central banks may, however, limit the number and/or the total volume of banknotes they are prepared to accept for any given transaction or on any one day Further details on that matter are provided in a separate press release which is to be issued to you this evening. (d) Allocation of monetary income As regards the income arising from the issuance of national banknotes from the participating Member States the Governing Council today decided that such income will not be redistributed prior to the introduction of the euro banknotes. The Governing Council also confirmed with respect to the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of the participating Member States for the financial years 1999 to 2001, that the monetary income for the said period will be calculated by employing the so-called indirect method, by multiplying a defined liability base by a specified reference rate of interest. The sum of the monetary income of each national central bank will be allocated to the participating national central banks in proportion to their paid-up share in the ECB's capital. Owing to the temporary character of the current decision, the question of monetary income allocation will need to be revisited before the introduction of euro banknotes in 2002. (e) Transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB Today the Governing Council also adopted an ECB Guideline establishing the legal format as well as the modalities of the initial transfer of foreign reserves from the national central banks to the ECB. In this connection and as a measure for covering possible foreign exchange risks for the ECB, the Governing Council endorsed, in line with the Statute of the ESCB, an ECB Recommendation for a Council Regulation which would authorise the ECB to increase its capital from the current level of E5 billion to up to twice that amount. (f) Monetary and foreign exchange policy Further decisions have also been taken with regard to preparing the monetary and foreign exchange policy of the euro area. On previous occasions I have mentioned to you that legal acts are under preparation which specify general principles to be followed by the national central banks when carrying out operations in domestic assets and liabilities and in foreign exchange reserve assets remaining with the national central banks. Such instruments, which are based on provisions of the Statute of the ESCB, aim from a legal point of view at ensuring the singleness of the ECB's monetary policy and the consistency of such transactions with the Community's exchange rate and monetary policies. Against this background, the Governing Council today adopted an ECB Guideline which establishes certain reporting obligations for the national central banks' domestic asset and liability management operations and subjects such transactions to the prior approval of the ECB whenever they exceed a certain amount. A similar ECB Guideline was adopted which subjects all operations in foreign reserve assets - including gold - which exceed a certain amount to the approval of the ECB. In addition, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Guideline according to which any participating Member States' transactions with their foreign exchange working balances which exceed a certain amount have to be notified to the ECB in advance. A similar arrangement is envisaged between the ECB and the Commission of the European Communities for all foreign exchange transactions carried out in the context of implementing the Commission's budget. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, you said that labour market and economic problems which are structural in character cannot be solved by monetary policy. Is this an appeal to certain leading policy makers - one of whom bears a French name, even though he is German - to stop pressuring you? Second question: Is it really possible, in times of historically low interest rates, to promote consumption and investment through lower interest rates? I didn't understand the second question. Question (translation): The second question: is it really possible to promote or encourage consumption and investment through central interest rates which are lower than those currently prevailing in Germany, for instance? The answer to the first question is that it is an appeal to all politically responsible office holders, and not to a single one. Because of the fact that monetary policy cannot solve structural problems, it is an appeal to those politically responsible to bear their responsibility in the right direction, but not any single one. Whether it is possible to promote consumption and investment through lower interest rates is very doubtful. The main factor contributing to the promotion of consumption and investment is confidence, and continued confidence, as well as continuity and stability also in monetary policy, whereas one quarter more or less is not the driving force behind consumer or investment spending. The co-ordination of policies in the economic field in general, i.e. monetary policies, fiscal policies, wage policies, is foreseen in the Treaty to take place through a dialogue between the various authorities on an almost continuous basis. That means, the President of the ECOFIN has the right to attend the meetings of the Council of the European Central Bank. He even has the right to introduce motions there, but he does not have the right to vote on those motions. And, conversely, the President and/or members of the Executive Board have the right to be invited to meetings of the ECOFIN Council. There is a continuous dialogue going on on the general stance of the various policies. Only the decisions on the various aspects of policies, be it monetary, be it fiscal, be it wage policies, are being upheld by the separate authorities in their independent way. I have not seen the precise proposals that Mr. Monti has formulated, but - to the extent that they were to undermine the Stability and Growth Pact to be applied to the full, as was intended - to that extent, I can assure you that the Council is not too happy with those proposals. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, have you already discussed whether your monetary policy strategy will include only one single reference rate or whether there will be an additional corridor and when can such a decision be expected? We have not discussed that particular question anew. We have - as was indicated in our previous press conference - defined what price stability is, what we understand price stability to be, and I would like to repeat that we define price stability as a rate of increase - and I underline the word increase - in prices of below 2%. Now, with Mr. Edlinger we had, in particular, an exchange of views on the current stance of economic policies in general, including monetary policy, and the assessment as we and the Finance Ministers respectively saw economic development in the world and in the euro area, in particular. Mr. de Silguy was present at the entire meeting of the Council, except when Mr. Monti was present, when we discussed areas of banking supervision which were outlined by the Vice-President a moment ago and which, in the European Commission, fall into his area of competence. I haven't seen yet that we don't speak with the same voice, because the central bankers have not spoken yet. And I hear different through the media; I hear various wishes being expressed, which I regard as normal. And they will not damage the credibility of the euro in any way, because they will not, in any way, have an impact on the behaviour of the decision-making body of the ECB, i.e. the Governing Council. Question (translation): Mr. President, a question on economic policy and on monetary policy in 1999. Fiscal and wage policy makers in many countries hold the view that they should take an expansionary stance so as to make up for gaps in demand. What is your position in this respect and how will monetary policy makers respond? What is your assessment, against this background, of the policy mix between monetary, fiscal and wage policy in view of the statements made by economic policy makers in the EMU countries? Well, we have noted already on various occasions both here and in the European Parliament -we and the European Commission have done the same - that we are somewhat concerned about the intensity with which the policies are directed to meet the criteria - not only the Maastricht criteria - but also the criteria implied in the Stability and Growth Pact. And we have warned against that repeatedly and have, in fact, done so again today. Nevertheless, I must conclude that, given the current monetary policy stance and assuming that that monetary policy stance will be continued also during the transition to the euro and given the current fiscal policy stance, there seem to be no indications that there is a policy mix in euroland which is detrimental to either fiscal or monetary policies. That would happen if you were to set that limit very low, but that is not the intention. The committee has already been established. It will be a decentral committee and also a decentral early warning point for any developments in the event of matters getting out of line with the plans. So, who will be on the committee? There will be three people from each participating national central bank and from the ECB, and the committee will be chaired by the Director General Operations of the European Central Bank, Mr. Papadia. As I have indicated in my Introductory Statement, after a period of depreciation of the dollar vis-à-vis the euro, or of appreciation of the euro, that trend has been reversed in recent days to some extent and as I indicated already a month ago, the level that has been reached and that has, in the meantime, somewhat changed again does not imply a cause of concern for the monetary authorities in Europe. Your second question on target zones: I want to repeat that the competence on exchange rate policies is in the hands of governments and not of the monetary authorities, but I do not want to keep secret either that, at this stage, when we are introducing the euro and getting the euro settled and into a credible currency, we are not very enthusiastic of taking up the idea of target zones at this stage. Question (translation): Mr. President, I should like to revert once more to the domestic policy debate in Germany. As you know, some of those involved are of the opinion that the heated controversy about the role and tasks as well as the independence of the Deutsche Bundesbank is, in essence, actually aimed at the European Central Bank as the Bundesbank will be giving up its responsibility in two months' time. Do you share this view and, if so, are you - as has been said - feeling placed under pressure or influenced by this debate? The answer can be fairly simple. The answer to the first question is ""yes"", And the answer to the second question is ""no"". Question (translation): Mr. President, I have probably not understood this issue properly, payment issues: the point you want to make there. Is it correct if I interpret it as such that you want to clearly say that you are prepared to be lender of last resort in cases of banking troubles. On the issue of lender of last resort, I will say no more than I said at the last press conference, which was already very little. And I would like to ask Monsieur Noyer to explain precisely what we do want to say. Noyer: What the Governing Council has discussed is, how can we in the Governing Council take into account the general responsibility of the ECB to contribute to a smooth conduct of policies by national authorities, because the precise tasks are, in the end, for national authorities to check whether the transition to the euro creates its special problems or is likely to accelerate some tendencies, and how can we assess any new risks that may arise and the best way to respond. It has nothing to do with the idea of lender of last resort that was addressed precisely by the President the last time in answer to a question on this matter. Question (translation): I should like to return once more to the debate on monetary policy. Could this renewed debate - which, if I have understood you correctly, you feel also has implications for the European Central Bank - could this debate be reason for you personally to re-consider the question of your perhaps retiring early from the office of President, as you had initially indicated? I don't think I have to comment any further after what I have said already on what I think of the discussion. So far it is a discussion in one country only. The development of a dialogue between the governmental authorities and the European Central Bank has taken the form of regular meetings of the so-called Euro 11 group, which is a very useful and fitting setting for having a dialogue about policies in general. We do not shy away from such a dialogue. As far as the discussion in one particular country about the position of the central bank, be it the central bank of that country or the European Central Bank, is concerned, I think that, so far, it has been a very one-sided discussion, as I understand it, because no central bank in any country has participated in that discussion, and I assume that this will remain so in the foreseeable future. Oh, that is a very hypothetical question - if the Treaty of Maastricht were to be changed, which would be required as a result of this discussion and which, in itself, is a very unlikely event, then I would of course also reconsider my position, but I do not regard a change in the Treaty of Maastricht as very likely for the first eight years to come. On the first question, I do not share the judgement of the analysts you quote that convergence is not enough, because I think we have seen in October, up and to including today, a remarkable rate of convergence toward the lower level of interest rates. And I would like to point out, I mentioned the key central bank interest rates at the moment at the lower end being 3.3%. Today, the Banco de España lowered its rate to 3.5%, so that it is getting close. And the Banco de Portugal has done a similar thing. And, in the case of Portugal, you have to look at the lowest official rate, rather than at the repo rate, because the banking system in Portugal happens to be in a very liquid situation; there is no liquidity deficit in Portugal, but a liquidity surplus. And, therefore, you have to look at the lower rate which is the relevant one to judge by. So convergence has continued and will continue during the remaining 60 days of this year, and we are very close already. Now is the ECB strong enough? I think the ECB is a very strong institution, staffed with highly qualified staff, and we are in the process of expanding it at a rather rapid pace. We are now in the process of finalising our budget for 1999, which also implies a sizeable further increase in the staff of the ECB. Those things take time in practice. Question (translation): I should like to revert once more to the debate on interest rates. As you know, it has been argued time and again that the European Central Bank - or that the level of central rates in Europe cannot, on grounds related to convergence, fall below the mark of 3.3% recorded in the core countries. Do you believe it to be possible for concerted action to reduce interest rates in future EMU countries to be taken before the end of the year or can this only occur next year, when the ECB can determine its interest rates independently? And then I have another question on ... Let me first answer the first question. It is, of course, nonsense that interest rates could not be raised or lowered further than below the levels they have already reached. It could be done. Whether it will be done - don't ask me, I would like to say, because, if I were to give you an answer, you wouldn't necessarily have to trust me. I will not, in other words, make forecasts about what will happen to interest rates. But, for the moment, the Council gives the highest priority to the continuation of the convergence process, which you can also interpret as an act of solidarity amongst the 11 central banks involved. Question (translation): And then I have another question on the currently ongoing debate in Germany on the role of the central banks. To what extent do you believe it to be appropriate for that debate to take place in public as it is and how will the ECB participate in it and to what extent do you feel it to be justified for the ECB to gear its interest rate policy also to the employment objective? The ECB will not participate in that discussion and, second, I would like to point out that it is the explicit mandate of the ECB with its policies to achieve price stability and - to the extend that the policy would not jeopardise price stability - to contribute to achieving the general economic goals of the Community, as they are spelled out in Article 2 of the Treaty, namely promoting growth and employment. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, you have emphasised that the latest statements of German policy makers in this debate are not pressuring you, but it is another question whether you see these statements as attempts to influence you, as is prohibited under Article 107 of the Maastricht Treaty. I do not see them as such. I hold it to be quite normal that, from the political side, there may from time to time be offered opinions or suggestions of what the political authorities would like interest rates to do or to be. That, in itself, is a quite normal phenomenon and it would be very abnormal if those suggestions were to be listened to. But then, as I said earlier, it is actually the right of the political authorities, in the person of the President of the Council of the Ministers of Finance and Economics, not only to attend meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, but also to introduce motions. So he can give suggestions there. The only thing he cannot do is vote on those motions. Question (translation): Mr. President, did Portugal and other European countries co-ordinate the latest reduction of their central or repo rates with you or not? And secondly: which countries are likely also to reduce their interest rates in the next few years, surely those with interest rates deviating most from 3.3 or 3%? Which countries, in your opinion, should make a move? Duisenberg (translation): Co-ordination is an ongoing process; it takes place all the time, and we inform one another continuously. This also holds true of Spain and Portugal, and it is not coincidental that the decisions announced today were announced today. And with regard to your question as to which countries can be expected to follow, I would say it is obvious - those countries in which the level of interest rates is not yet the lowest in Europe. Well, as I have said, I was not concerned about the level that the dollar has reached, so I will not express any pleasure at the movement over the last few days. What I am most pleased about is that the situation seems to have settled somewhat. Yes. On the first question, I only can give what may seem a legalistic answer. The legal situation is that, until the 1st of January, every single central bank is autonomous in determining its policies. So the answer to your question whether the Bundesbank or De Nederlandsche Bank or the Banque de France could do something unilaterally is ""yes"". If the question were to be ""will they"", the answer would be that it is very unlikely that they will do anything without consulting all their partners. The co-ordination of monetary policy is already taking shape increasingly intensively across Europe. Well, I would like to point out that decisions are not only being taken precisely on the day and hour that the Council is meeting, but we are in continuous touch with each other and there is a continuous co-ordination and discussion going on between central bankers across Europe, so that the developments of today, I can assure you, certainly did not come as a surprise to any of us. "
1998-10-13,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, in line with our stated intention, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of todays meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. The length of my introductory statement reflects the importance of the matters dealt with today. As usual, the Governing Council devoted part of its meeting to an exchange of views on recent economic, monetary and financial developments. This discussion took place against the background of conflicting messages. Clearly, on the one hand, the data on the economic situation in the United States and Europe, especially in the euro area, mainly indicate a continuation of real GDP growth, though possibly at a somewhat slower pace. On the other hand, however, the global macroeconomic environment has deteriorated. In particular, the number of signs suggesting that the world economy will slow down in 1999 is increasing. At the same time, uncertainty in the financial markets has been heightened by news of the near collapse of a large hedge fund, losses by individual financial institutions, and the large movements in world equity, bond and foreign exchange markets. In the view of the Governing Council, in responding to recent economic developments and current market conditions, it is of the utmost importance that proposals inspired by policy activism that do not take due account of the complexity of the issues at stake are avoided. This would only contribute to compounding the uncertainties which underlie the prevailing global financial market volatility. Against this background, the Governing Council is of the view that proposals for a reassessment of capital controls as an acceptable policy option, or recent calls for world-wide, uniform interest rate reductions, are inappropriate as they do not address the very nature of the problems. At the same time, the Governing Council considers structural improvements at the global level to be warranted. These should focus, in particular, first on enhancing the transparency of both the public and private sectors; second, on strengthening domestic banking systems, primarily in emerging markets and economies in transition; and, third, on improving financial crisis prevention and management, in particular through the increased involvement of the private sector. A number of proposals have already been developed on these issues, which should now be finalised with a view to their early and forceful implementation. In addition, the Governing Council stressed that such structural improvements at the global level would have to be accompanied by sound policies at home. In this respect, given the size of the euro area and its global role, it is of crucial importance that price stability - and hence a climate conducive to growth and employment - should be maintained in the euro area. Achieving this will also be of vital importance for the world economy as a whole. With this in mind, the Governing Council reviewed the monetary, financial and macroeconomic situation in the euro area. First, the Council discussed the monetary situation with reference to preliminary data on the basis of the new harmonised reporting system for money and banking statistics. Once internal work has been completed, these monetary statistics will be made available to the public. When looking at various definitions of broad money, our preliminary data show broadly similar and stable annual growth rates of between 3 and 5% in 1997 and the first half of 1998. According to our initial analysis, these data do not appear to signal inflationary pressures arising from money at this juncture. However, given the preliminary nature of the new data, caution should be exercised with regard to their interpretation. Second, as regards other financial indicators, although long-term interest rates have risen recently, they are still at low levels by historical standards and the yield curve has levelled off relative to the situation some months ago. A substantial part of developments in bond markets during recent months reflects a ""flight into quality"". Third, the Governing Council discussed the broad outlook for prices in the context of the overall macroeconomic environment. With respect to price developments, international factors continued to exert downward pressure. HICP rates in the euro area fell to 1.2% in August after having remained unchanged at 1.4% from April to July. This mainly reflected a decline in energy prices, which were almost 4% lower in August than a year earlier, and in other commodity prices. For the euro area as a whole, price pressure as indicated by industrial output prices and labour costs also remained modest. In 1999 average inflation in the euro area is expected to remain subdued, according to the projections available. Fourth, considerable difficulties are encountered in precisely assessing and quantifying the impact of recent international developments on prices and, equally, on activity. Recent data seem to suggest that real GDP growth in the euro area, which reached 0.6% in the first quarter of 1998, has slowed down somewhat in the second quarter. We need to await the release of more complete and thereby more reliable data for the euro area as a whole before a final view can be taken. Other recently released data on industrial production, the volume of retail sales and passenger car registrations appear to point to continued growth. This view is also supported by EC survey data, although some indicators have remained constant or have fallen back slightly in recent months; nonetheless, all these indicators remain well above their long-term averages. The Governing Council welcomed recent interest rate reductions by a number of euro area national central banks. As a result, euro area-wide three-month interest rates have now reached a level of 3.8%, which implies a decrease of around 15 basis points since the end of August. These changes underline the fact that the process of the convergence of central bank interest rates in the euro area, which is to be concluded by the end of this year, is clearly under way. The Governing Council considered further interest rate convergence towards the lower end of the current range prevailing in the euro area as being appropriate, given our current knowledge of monetary trends and the prospects for price developments and taking account of an environment characterised by risks of downward pressures. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely monetary, financial and economic developments within the euro area with a view to determining the appropriate level of money market interest rates for the euro area. Meanwhile, the Governing Council will continue to monitor closely fiscal intentions in the euro area Member States. The structural budgetary positions in several Member States are still far from being close to balance or in surplus as required by the Stability and Growth Pact. Therefore, these Member States are not yet sufficiently prepared to enable automatic stabilisers to function in the event of a slowdown in real GDP growth, while still respecting the 3% reference value set out in the Treaty and ensuring a decline of debt ratios at an appropriate pace. Moreover, in a number of Member States, against the background of a still favourable and partly better than expected growth performance, short-term budgetary targets appear not to represent structural improvements. In addition to the review of economic developments, a number of decisions were taken with regard to various aspects of the preparatory work for Stage Three. (a) Monetary policy issues First and foremost, let me turn to the issue of the monetary policy strategy. I can inform you that at todays meeting the Governing Council reached agreement on the main features of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy that the ESCB will pursue in Stage Three of Monetary Union. Before explaining our decision on the strategy, let me emphasise certain important characteristics of the environment in which the single monetary policy will operate as of next January. Of most concern to the ESCB are some uncertainties which will inevitably arise as a result of the move to Stage Three. These relate, in particular, to the way in which the transition to Stage Three of Monetary Union will affect economic behaviour and institutional and financial structures in the euro area. They also relate to statistical issues. Against this background, the Governing Council has chosen a distinct monetary policy strategy, one that reflects the special circumstances it faces at present. This strategy will ensure continuity with the successful strategies pursued by participating national central banks in recent years, while taking into account - to the extent needed - the unique situation created by the transition to Monetary Union. With this context in mind, the Governing Council today agreed on the main elements of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the ESCB. These elements concern: the quantitative definition of the primary objective of the single monetary policy, price stability; a prominent role for money with a reference value for the growth of a monetary aggregate; and a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for future price developments. First, let me stress that, as mandated by the Treaty establishing the European Community, the maintenance of price stability will be the primary objective of the ESCB. Therefore, the ESCBs monetary policy strategy will focus strictly on this objective. In the interest of transparency and in order to give clear guidance with regard to expectations regarding future price developments, the Governing Council of the ECB has agreed to announce a quantitative definition of price stability. In this context, the Governing Council of the ECB has adopted the following definition: ""Price stability shall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%"". Let me emphasise the fact that price stability is an objective which is to be maintained over the medium term. The current rate of HICP inflation in the euro area is in line with this objective. Three features of this definition should be highlighted: first, the HICP is the most appropriate price measure for the ESCBs definition of price stability. It is the only price index that will be sufficiently harmonised across the euro area at the start of Stage Three. second, by defining price stability using the HICP ""for the euro area"", the Governing Council of the ECB makes it clear that it will base its decisions on monetary, economic and financial developments in the euro area as a whole. I should like to emphasise the fact that the single monetary policy will adopt a euro area-wide perspective; it will not react to specific regional or national developments. third, this definition is very much in line with most current definitions adopted by national central banks in the euro area. Furthermore, the statement that ""price stability is to be maintained over the medium term"" reflects the need for monetary policy to have a forward-looking, medium-term orientation. It also acknowledges the existence of short-term volatility in prices which cannot be controlled by monetary policy. In order to maintain price stability, the Governing Council of the ECB agreed to adopt a monetary policy strategy which will consist of two key elements. Deviations of current monetary growth from the reference value would, under normal circumstances, signal risks to price stability. The ESCB will assess how best to counter these risks. However, the concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the ESCB to mechanistically correct deviations of monetary growth from the reference value over the short term. The relationship between actual monetary growth and the pre-announced reference value will be regularly and thoroughly analysed by the Governing Council of the ECB; the result of this analysis and its impact on monetary policy decisions will be explained to the public. The precise definition of the reference aggregate and the specific value of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth will be announced by the Governing Council of the ECB in December 1998. However, while the monetary aggregates contain important and relevant information for monetary policy-making, monetary developments will not constitute a complete summary of all the information about the economy that needs to be known for an appropriate monetary policy to be set. Thus the Governing Council will systematically analyse all the information available regarding the prospects for, and the risks to, price stability in the euro area as a whole. This strategy underlines the strong commitment of the Governing Council of the ECB to its primary objective and should facilitate the achievement of this overriding goal. It will also ensure the transparency of the ESCBs decision-making and its accountability. Based on its strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB will inform the public regularly and in detail about its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area and the reasoning behind its specific policy decisions. This strategy is designed to avoid giving the impression that monetary policy responds ""mechanistically"" to deviations from a single target or changes to a specific variable. The monetary policy strategy that has been selected by the Governing Council of the ECB signals that monetary policy in the euro area will be determined in a manner which will maintain price stability, responding to new developments in or disturbances to the economy in an appropriate manner which is consistent with this overriding objective. The strategy therefore offers a clear and transparent framework within which the Governing Council of the ECB will be able to assess and present monetary policy decisions. Please note that the main features of the strategy are also summarised in a press release to be distributed to you. Still in the context of preparing for the single monetary policy, you may recall that in July I informed you about the range of institutions subject to reserve requirements and the liabilities included in the reserve base. I also gave you indications regarding the lump-sum allowance to be deducted from an institutions reserve requirement and the reserve ratio, for which the Governing Council envisaged a range of 1.5-2.5%. Today, the Governing Council discussed the last remaining open issues regarding the ESCBs minimum reserve system and confirmed that, first, the lump-sum allowance will be set at a level of  100,000 and, second, the reserve ratio will be set in the middle of the indicated range, i.e. at 2%. Finally, it was agreed that a credit institution will be allowed to deduct from the reserve base 10% of its debt securities with a maturity of up to two years and of its money market paper if it cannot provide evidence of the corresponding interbank liabilities. An ECB Regulation laying down the features of the ESCBs minimum reserve system will be published shortly. In the meantime, further details are provided in a separate press release which is to be issued to you this evening. (b) Foreign exchange policy issues The Governing Council agreed on a set of legal documentation setting out the respective roles of the ECB and the euro area national central banks (NCBs) in the management of the ECBs foreign reserve assets. The legal documentation specifies, inter alia, the role of the NCBs in carrying out operations involving the foreign reserve assets of the ECB and incorporates master netting agreements to be signed by the ECB and market counterparties. (c) Payment systems issues As you are aware, TARGET will not be the only system available for cross-border payments. For non-monetary policy transactions it will, for instance, also be possible to process payments via the EBA Euro Clearing System (currently the ECU Clearing and Settlement System). While TARGET is a real-time gross settlement system, the EBA alternative is a clearing system, i.e. the payments have to be settled at the end of the day. In this regard, the Governing Council has agreed that the ECB will be involved. The EBA Euro Clearing System will, therefore, open a central settlement account at the ECB for its settlements within the euro area and may also open settlement accounts with those NCBs which agree to do so. The ECB will also hold the account on which the EBA Euro Clearing Systems liquidity pool will be maintained. Agreements between the ECB and the EBA covering the operation of these accounts are currently being finalised. (d) The euro banknotes With a view to increasing efficiency in combating counterfeiting, the Governing Council confirmed the agreement reached by the EMI Council that a Currency Analysis Centre and a Counterfeit Currency Database will be set up, which will store technical data relating to counterfeit euro banknotes. I should point out that the intention is to continue to deal with counterfeits of other currencies (e.g. the national currencies of participating or non-participating Member States and the US dollar) at the national level. All EU Member States will have the option of full participation in the database system. Although a decision on the location of the Currency Analysis Centre will not be taken until the early part of 1999, the Governing Council today approved the principles governing the way in which counterfeit euro banknotes will be handled. Further details are provided in a separate press release which is to be issued to you this evening. The Governing Council has also agreed on the approach to be used for estimating the number of euro banknotes to be printed before the launch date of 1 January 2002. The quantity of euro banknotes to be printed will be determined by the number required to replace the stocks of national banknotes in circulation (launch stocks) in the participating EU Member States together with the volume of the logistical stocks needed to ensure that the banknote changeover operates smoothly. It is currently estimated that up to approximately 13 billion euro banknotes will need to be printed before the issue date for the eleven participating Member States. This estimate will be updated regularly as we approach 2002. A separate press release on banknotes is to be issued to you this evening. Finally, the Governing Council also addressed the following matters. First, with regard to statistics, it was agreed to publish an Addendum to the document entitled the ""Money and Banking Statistics Compilation Guide - Guidance provided to NCBs for the compilation of money and banking statistics for submission to the ECB"". The Addendum covers the treatment of both money market paper and bill-based lending within the harmonised framework for money and banking statistics. The original Compilation Guide was published by the EMI in April 1998. Second, the Governing Council took stock of the current state of affairs with regard to the testing of critical ESCB systems and procedures in the run-up to the start of Stage Three. The ESCB has just commenced a general ""dress rehearsal"" i.e. a final testing phase for all ESCB systems and procedures. Finally, looking a little further ahead to beyond the start of Stage Three, the Governing Council also agreed that a series of tests should be conducted during the course of 1999 in order to ensure that all ESCB-wide systems and applications are Year 2000 compliant. Q: Could I ask you, Mr Duisenberg, first of all how will you conduct the monetary policy next year in the current economic environment and how do you assess the balance of risk at the moment? I is it closer do you think to undershooting the money supply target than overshooting? In other words is deflation the possibility in Europe as opposed to inflation at the moment? WFD: We have no indications based on the most recent data that there is any tendency for deflation to be present, I would like to point out that the definition of price stability on purpose talks about an increase of prices of below 2 per cent over time. This is a bias in the direction that price stability is not a zero increase. Not having inflation but accept deflation that is not our aim. But that shows the formulation of monetary policy will not be easy under the current circumstances. Well, that's a statement of fact, I would say. Q: If we have a financial and real crisis with lower growth rates in next year and monetary policy could not help. What could help? What are the reasons for this crisis we have in your view? WFD: Well, I tried to emphasise that all the talk internationally and particularly during the annual meetings in Washington about the crisis at hand in our minds was - if not exaggerated than somewhat overdone - . We have as I indicated both in Europe and the United States still a situation of relatively robust economic developments. There are signs that there may be some slowdown but we certainly are not inclined to talk in terms of crisis in this area. Now, to come to your question: If there were to be a crisis next year what could be done? We'll see about that when that event arrives. What I indicated now is we strongly support improvements in the financial system worldwide, in the strengthening of banking systems, in the transparency of the financial structures that is and in measures geared toward prevention of crisis to be developed particularly in the context of the International Monetary Fund. Q: Mr. Duisenberg, you said that you considered calls for global rate cuts inappropriate at the moment of course as far as calls for rate cuts especially in Europe, especially in the ECB Future ECB Area are concerned. Do you think at all that calls for getting lower convergence rates than it looks like at the moment are in any way justified? In other words, to you think we should enter at a lower end than it looks presently or should we get a quick rate cut from the ECB when it comes into power? WFD: We explicitly refrain from already to try to make an assessment on what rates should be prevalent at the moment of transition. We'll see about that when we get there. What we say now is, we regard the current level of interest rates prevailing in Europe as appropriate for the economic situation. And we recognise at the same time that the process of convergence of interest rates which is important and which I expect to be completed by the end of this year. It has been going on, has been continued as witnessed by the interest rate declines we have seen over the past few weeks. And it also has to continue in the coming months. That is to say a convergence in the direction of the lower level of interest rates that are prevailing at the moment in Europe. Q: I have a question about your monetary policy strategy regarding the dual pillars of the strategy the monetary element and the inflation forecast or real economy element. Will they carry approximately equal weights or will you decide the relative weighting between the two pillars on a case by case basis? And secondly, when you say you will inform ... WFD: Let me answer the first question first, it is not a coincidence that I have used the words that money will play a prominent role. So if you call it the two pillars, one pillar is thicker than the other is, or stronger than the other, but how much I couldn't tell you. Q: You said, if I may just add a related question to this, you said you will inform the public, if in cases you do deviate from what the monetary targets indicate and you will explain in detail why you will do so - will that explanation include detailed forecasts about future inflation or output estimates? WFD: No. We will use inflation forecasts, but we will not publish inflation forecasts. Q: I have two questions, is the convergence of interest rates quick enough for the current situation. Some countries, some central banks didn't cut the rates yet. Will it not be too dangerous if they come too much close to December in cutting the rates, because they will cause some fear it could cause strong monetary growth. WFD: We do not share that fear and the Council agrees on the fact that the convergence process in the direction of the lower range of the levels at which rates currently are will and has to continue in the weeks to come until the end of this year and beyond that. Do not expect from me at least vis-à-vis you specific recommendations for specific countries. Q: Within the last year there was great speculation in the financial community that countries like Germany would have to increase their interest rates to achieve convergence / Germany didn't. In fact the Bundesbank did raise its rates slightly to 3.3 but there was an assumption by most economists that this process was going to continue, now everybody seems to be saying that the convergence will be down to the German rate, my question is ... WFD: And to the French and to the Dutch and to the Austrian ... Q: True ... my question is, doesn't this in itself imply a bit more expansion of monetary policy than people were envisioning perhaps a year ago. I know you are not responsible for this speculation of independent economists, but nevertheless there is an expansionary field of things. WFD: To the extent you regard lower interest rates as expansionary that is correct, that is the implication. I do admit that there has been some let's say change of assessment of the level of interest rates that would be appropriate for the EURO area as a whole from a year ago. Q: I have two questions, Mr. Duisenberg, first of all what is the role of the external value of the euro in your strategy e.g. in your press conference a couple of months ago, you said that a fall in the dollar could be seen to have an impact of the competitiveness of Euroland. Now the dollar has fallen even further and there are forecasts this will continue. What does that mean concerning the external value of the euro versus the dollar for the monetary strategy of the ECB? And the second question what about the lender of last resort function if there's a bank crisis and someone has to react to this. WFD: The external value of the euro in other words the exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar and particularly the yen will be one of the broad range of indicators which will be used to assess the impact on future price developments. It will be one indicator and I can't give any indication on the relative importance of this indicator vis-à-vis all other indicators that will be monitored. On the lender of last resort: I would like to convey to you: that the Governing Council is aware that discussion is ongoing in some quarters on the so called risk of financial crisis in Europe following the launch of the euro given the absence of a unique institution responsible for lender of last resort operations. Let me answer that question as follows very firmly and concisely. The Governing Council has this issue well under control but will never make anything public in this regard. Q: Mr. President, you said an inflationary target of CPI growth below 2 per cent. Why doesn't the Central Bank combine it with a forecast for inflation for the next 2 years, such as the Bank of England usually does that when they announce their inflationary target? Why are you not doing this? WFD: There are several reasons why we are not doing this. One is because we don't like forecasts to become self-fulfilling prophecies. That is not to say that we do not use forecasts. Of course we do and we will only not publish them, because of the danger that they would become self-fulfilling prophecies. Can you think of any more reasons? Christian! CN: Absolutely clear. Q: You promised me more reasons? WFD: Well, another reason is also which definition of inflation you are referring to. We will not only look at the HICP inflation. We will also look at other inflation indicators: output prices, wages, which is also a price factor ... so that is already a range and developments maybe divergent in the various composites of the inflation landscape. Well, that is the second reason. Q: Mr. President, Germany got a new government with a finance minister who finds this discussion on the independence of the central banks ridiculous, he uses the German word ""albern"". Do you think with the new government there will come a new relation in the culture concerning the relation between the German government and the ECB? WFD: I wouldn't think so, because they would have to change the law for that. The Treaty of Maastricht ensures the independence of not only the ECB but also the NCBs. So I don't think there will be different relation. Q: Mr. President, a couple of questions. One, is a follow up on Mr. Hutter's question on the Dollar. The last press conference you had mentioned you were somewhat concerned about the rate of the Dollar. It was around a 1.68 DM level then. Since then we have had a fall below 1.59. I think we are at 1.63 right now. I would be interested how you feel now at a lower level and whether you are concerned that it could impede European growth? The other, you said inflation below 2 per cent at what point would you start becoming concerned and thinking that you need to reflate below 2 per cent can be 0.1 per cent or minus 2 per cent. And the other ... last question. The German-Italian-yield-spread has been widening, are you concerned about that? WFD: The first question was the dollar. The Governing Council extensively discussed the developments in the exchange markets up until today and concluded that the current rate, which was reached by the dollar, was not a cause for concern. To the second question of under 2 per cent: If there were to be a prolonged period of deflation that would be a cause for concern. Not the single figures over one month or even 2 months. Deflation is a phenomenon to be avoided as much as inflation. I do emphasise that our monetary policy will have a medium term outlook. So if there were price decreases over a certain period of time that would become a matter of concern. CN: There was a question about the spreads between Germany and Italy. Until now we have considered that the movements in spreads on the markets were mainly due to either very extremely short influences from the outside world. I.e. outside Europe, where spreads have developed in an unordered way. That is true, for instance, spreads between public and private debts. They caused some turbulences in Europe. But what we saw quite recently were small technical movements. And also the spreads that may have enlarged here and there, we consider them as mainly market imperfections and nothing of strategic impact. In such a difficult financial market situation as we have seen over the world recently, you can imagine that naturally some of the turbulences would have spilled over to Europe under former conditions. May I present on the dollar, neither to make it clear, as you said that we of course do not neglect nor to intend to neglect the development of the dollar? The President said that clearly. But every time the Governing Council has to make an assessment. It's an assessment of what it means in different terms. I would like to add that personally I wish the Americans the same good as I wish the Europeans: that they have a strong Dollar, as we want to have a strong euro, but this is another story. Q: Mr. Duisenberg, you mentioned a couple of the indicators you might be looking at, and judging future price developments. And you mentioned the euro external value, you mentioned the price/labour-cost developments, and so on. What about unemployment, would that be one of the indicators as well? And the second question on an issue we haven't touched upon today, has anything changed on the role for the foreign reserves. Is anything new to be said for the role that gold might be playing in the foreign reserves? WFD: The developments in the real economy including the development of employment or unemployment will of course also be one of the indicators which we will use in assessing the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance. It will not be an aim in itself. The primary aim of monetary policy remains solely price stability, but as an indicator of course it will be used. On gold the word has not been used today, neither yesterday. Q: Mr. Duisenberg, you mentioned the call for uniform interest rate reductions. We have a new government in Germany, or we will have one soon. And they won't be supply supporters. They are going to try and have demand management policy together with France. Now, do you think this will mean that there will be greater pressure on the ECB in the years to come, if the to major countries in Europe follow a similar policy? WFD: I will not deny that, but it's against a strong institution. So we can resist that, I believe. We make our own judgements, take our own decisions in view of our own analysis. Q: Something I really didn't understand when you were speaking of the countries of which the budget deficit is not coming down enough and because of structural changes not being introduced yet. You are not so satisfied. What should be done? WFD: What I said was that there are countries in Europe, which experience a growth performance rather better than originally estimated. Yet they do not seem to use what we than call growth dividend that arises from that, for further reductions of the fiscal deficit, And that is something which we regret. Q: I have a question about the German government. When you mentioned these calls for lower rates, can I ask you specifically directing that towards Oskar Lafontaine? WFD: Sorry I didn't understand. Q: If you are specifically directing that towards Oskar Lafontaine, he has been the most outspoken, and if so, do you see this setting a new tone and perhaps also at the public, how will you deal with that even if it is a strong institution? WFD: Well, I deal with it the way I just said and described. I didn't direct my remarks to anyone in particular. But I do suppose that everybody, who was willing to listen, had good ears. Q: I'm just picking up on the last point that was being made with the recent results of the German election. It means that most Europeans have voted for governments that would like employment and job creation to be added to the aims of monetary policy and that view of monetary policy differs from yours. Do you interpret the independence of the Central Bank be a licence to ignore the democratically expressed views of Europeans? WFD: Oh, because the democratically elected representatives of Europeans also concluded an international treaty, the Treaty of Maastricht. And they appointed a board of directors for the new institution. That was also done by democratically elected persons. And, of course, I do not ignore but I do emphasise that the ECB has been endowed with a unique and singular mandate namely to achieve price stability, and that in addition to that, to the extent and without prejudice to price stability it shall support the general policies of the European Community as are outlined in Article 2 of the Treaty but only to the extent that it does not endanger the primary aim. Q: Mr. President, I have 2 questions (in French), could you be more specific about the countries which have not reached the dividend from growth to reduce their fiscal deficits further. And I also like to have your view on the proposal of the French Prime Minister to launch a major European loan to support growth, what do you feel about that? WFD: I understood every word. But Christian Noyer may have understood you better. CN: I will of course not name a specific country. It is more or less the case for all of them I would say. To the second question: Since I do not have a full knowledge of the precise proposal I can hardly make any comment on it. The only remark of a more general nature that I would like to make is that anything that would result in the equivalent of increasing deficits would of course run into the difficulty being of contrary of the stability pact and would not be helpful. But it might be very different. I have no idea of the content of that proposal. Q: First question, there are more and more economists fearing a credit crunch not just in Japan but out of Japan, too. So I would like to have your opinion on that, the second question is there was this suggestion by Romano Prodi to use the reserves or some reserves of the National Central Banks to finance employment programs. And as far as I know the French Government was all delighted with the proposal. So, what is your opinion to that? WFD: On the question of the credit crunch we have tried to carefully analyse the most recent data on the banking statistics and the Governing Council sees no signs of a credit crunch emanating in Europe. On the Prodi remarks regarding the use of excess reserves I would like to say the following. First of all I don't know - I hope he does, what excess reserves are. To the extent that you talk about Central Banks selling reserves to finance certain activities, I would like to say there is an agreement that this would be purely inflationary financing by Central bank money. With this in mind I would like to say if you want inflationary financing you don't have to sell assets. You can simply order the central bank to print money. It's far cheaper. "
1998-09-11,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report not only on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, but also - as you are already aware - on the outcome of the meetings of the Governing Council and the General Council that took place on 1 September 1998. It was in view of the short time span between the two sets of meetings that we decided that it would be more efficient to hold only one press conference to provide you with a summary of our deliberations. It is my intention to continue this practice for the remaining meetings of this year. In this regard, the Governing Council will meet, not only as scheduled on 13 October, 3 November and 1 December 1998, but there will also be an additional meeting on Tuesday, 22 December 1998. By this time, the bulk of nearly five years of preparatory work - including the ""EMI years"" - will be behind us and I envisage that the Governing Council’s final meeting before the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will be devoted to fine-tuning its last-minute preparations. You will recall that monetary policy decisions remain a national competence until 31 December 1998. Looking ahead to next year, the Governing Council will hold fortnightly meetings and I intend to hold a press conference, normally, once a month. For the first quarter of 1999, I envisage holding a press conference immediately after the first meeting of each month. Further details of the meetings schedule are provided in the separate press release that will be issued to you this evening. Let me, however, return to the present. The Governing Council and the General Council devoted part of their September meetings to an extended exchange of views on recent economic, monetary and financial developments. In particular, much attention was paid to the global economic and financial environment of the future euro area, which has clearly worsened. Two major factors are currently affecting capital markets. First, the ""flight into quality"". Second - and related - the tendency to switch from equities to bonds. As evidenced once again over the past few days by large swings in investor sentiment, the monetary policy environment has become more uncertain. One focal aspect of the discussion has been a close monitoring of the financial crisis in Russia. As we all know, the Russian crisis has added to concerns regarding the state of the world economy at a time when the crisis in Asia is still ongoing and growth in Japan is negative. These concerns have been fuelled by renewed strains in international financial markets as well as sharp fluctuations and downward corrections in major stock markets. There is no doubt that these developments will have a dampening effect on the world economy. However, their precise impact is difficult to measure at the current juncture. On the one hand, economic and model-based analysis still suggests only moderate effects on prices and output in the euro area. This is due to the fact that, first, most of the crisis regions are quite small in economic terms, i.e. when compared with world GDP or their contribution to world trade. Second, trade links between these countries and the euro area are also of limited size. Third, the euro area itself is a very large economy, which is only directly exposed to variations in global trade to a certain degree. However, on the other hand, this analysis should not mislead us. We are perfectly aware that the risks associated with current global developments go beyond those effects which we can measure directly. In this respect one may think of indirect influences resulting from changes in confidence, saving and expenditure within the euro area. We have to take these risks seriously and analyse the situation soberly, but we should also not dramatise. Let me now turn to the latest available data. These seem to indicate that economic expansion within the euro area has remained broadly on track, despite the worsening of the external environment. Domestic demand remains strong, while the contribution to growth from net exports has declined. Both private consumption and investment provided an important stimulus to the growth rate in the first quarter of this year. More up-to-date indicators point towards continued expansion in the second quarter, albeit at a possibly more moderate pace than in the first quarter. The outlook on consumption is supported by higher real earnings growth and declining unemployment, and is reflected in consumer confidence. The evidence for the corporate sector is perhaps more mixed. As compared to the first quarter of 1998, industrial production figures show a somewhat slower rate of increase in the period from April to May, but capacity utilisation has continued to increase and this, combined with low interest rates, should underpin investment. European Commission survey data, such as confidence indicators and the assessment of order books, bear witness to relatively high levels, both with respect to their long-term averages and recent peaks. This can also be taken as a favourable indicator for continued growth in the short term, although some indicators have not improved further since the spring. Unemployment has also been declining, but at a modest pace, and from a high level. In discussing the cyclical uncertainties, one should not forget that work on badly needed structural reforms has not so far made much progress. Considering recent price developments, HICP inflation for the euro area as a whole remained stable at 1.4% between May and July. Both domestic and external factors still appear to be favourable, suggesting that euro area inflation may be expected to remain subdued in the future. An important external factor underlying the favourable prospects for inflation is the sharp decline in oil and commodity prices, which is partly associated with developments in Asia. Moreover, domestic sources of inflation, such as those arising from the labour market situation and capacity utilisation, are also relatively moderate at the present juncture. In my opinion, taking a euro area wide perspective, these views are also broadly compatible with current monetary and financial developments. In this connection, please take note that we should soon have new information on monetary developments on the basis of the new statistical reporting framework for money and banking. The environment of significant volatility in international financial markets, particularly stock markets, appears to account for much of the recent decline in long-term interest rates in the euro area to historically low levels, as investors have sought to protect themselves against heightened global risk. Nonetheless, it is notable that the euro area yield curve shifted downwards at all maturities, which to some extent would tend to indicate a further decline in long-term inflation expectations for the euro area as a whole. As we approach the start of Stage Three, we shall need to continue to monitor closely economic, monetary and financial developments within the euro area and in the world economy. This will allow us eventually to set the interest rate for the euro area as a whole. At the same time, we shall also need to monitor fiscal intentions in the euro area Member States, as they will become more transparent over the autumn. If governments merely adhere to previous deficit targets for 1999, the structural position of budgets in quite a number of countries would effectively deteriorate. This would entail that they would move farther away from, rather than approach, the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, which calls for the achievement of a budget close to balance or even in surplus. In addition to the review of economic developments, a number of organisational issues were settled. (i) The General Council adopted its Rules of Procedure, which will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. You will recall that I informed you that the Governing Council’s Rules of Procedure were adopted in July. (ii) The General Council also decided that the non-euro area national central banks shall pay up 5% of their subscriptions to the capital of the European Central Bank (ECB). However, the four national central banks concerned will not be asked actually to pay in their share as the amount due is less than they can expect to receive as their share in the proceeds of the liquidation of the European Monetary Institute (EMI). Further details on the actual amounts involved are provided in the separate handout that will be issued to you this evening. (iii) For its part, the Governing Council completed the list of committees which will assist in the work of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). In addition to the eleven ESCB Committees agreed upon at the meeting in July, the Governing Council decided to establish an International Relations Committee and a Budget Committee. The latter was set up in order to provide transparency to the shareholders of the ECB - the national central banks - on matters relating to the budget of the ECB. (iv) Finally, the Governing Council endorsed the draft Headquarters Agreement between the German Federal Government and the ECB, which will be signed here in Frankfurt on 18 September 1998. A number of decisions were also taken with regard to various aspects of the preparatory work for Stage Three. The General Council endorsed the text of an Agreement between the ECB and the non-euro area national central banks, laying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in Stage Three (the so-called ERM II). You will recall that the European Council in Amsterdam in June last year agreed to set up an exchange rate mechanism in Stage Three to replace the present European Monetary System (EMS). For this reason, the EMI had, on behalf of the ECB, prepared a draft Central Bank Agreement to replace the current exchange rate mechanism (ERM I, if you like) by a new one in Stage Three. It is this Agreement which has now been signed by the President of the ECB and the Governors of the four non-euro area national central banks. The signature by the latter implies their agreement to the operating procedures. It does not, however, imply their participation in ERM II. Further details on the conventions and procedures for ERM II are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this evening. The Agreement itself will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The Governing Council agreed on several issues relating to the monetary policy framework in Stage Three. At the centre of this framework is the report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"", which contains a detailed description of the monetary policy instruments and procedures to be applied by the ESCB in Stage Three. The report expands on and updates the material included in an earlier version of the report that was published by the EMI in September 1997. I should like to limit my remarks in this regard to the announcement that a copy of this comprehensive report will be released very shortly, at which time a separate press release explaining the nature and purpose of the documentation will be issued. The Governing Council also agreed upon a guideline for the management of the foreign exchange assets by the national central banks and for the Member States’ transactions with their foreign exchange working balances. These are now being formalised in official legal documentation. The Governing Council endorsed the statistical framework on the basis of a number of reports that had been prepared by the EMI - many of which had been published in the past - thereby confirming the ECB’s statistical requirements for Stage Three. I should perhaps point out that the reporting framework for the money and banking statistics of the ECB will appear in the ""General Documentation"" that will be released next Wednesday. With regard to the euro banknotes, the Governing Council confirmed (in line with previous recommendations by the EMI) that seven banknote denominations would be issued: Euro 5, Euro 10, Euro 20, Euro 50, Euro 100, Euro 200 and Euro 500. Furthermore, it decided that there would not be any national features on the euro banknotes. As you know, the euro banknotes will be put into circulation on 1 January 2002. Thus there are fewer than 800 working days to go before their launch. The Governing Council took note that the technical preparations for the euro banknotes are proceeding according to schedule. The origination phase (i.e. the process of converting the designs into proof-prints) has now been successfully concluded and a zero-production run will be conducted in the autumn before mass production starts in early 1999. The Governing Council endorsed a list of eligible securities settlement systems following an assessment of such systems against standards that had previously been laid down for their use in the credit operations of the ESCB. The list, which indicates those securities settlement systems that will be used by the ESCB and the conditions for their use, will be set out in the ""General Documentation"", to which I have already referred. In addition, the Governing Council approved a report on the ""Assessment of EU securities settlement systems against the standards for their use in ESCB credit operations"". It is intended to release this report during the next couple of weeks. We are at your disposal for any further questions. "
1998-07-08,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of the second meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held yesterday. The Governing Council first assessed current economic developments in the euro area. The general picture is one of continued economic expansion combined with broadly low inflation. Several forecasts made during spring 1998 have even suggested slightly lower rates of inflation for 1998-99 compared with expectations in autumn 1997. As far as price developments are concerned, inflation as measured by the harmonised consumer price index (HICP) is estimated to have risen slightly in April, to 1.4%, but has not increased further in May. Output growth has remained strong in recent quarters, with annual growth rates close to or even exceeding 3%. Economic growth has been driven increasingly by domestic demand rather than net exports, as might be expected at this stage of the cycle. Private consumption and stockbuilding have been the main factors underlying domestic demand to date. The favourable conjunctural situation has started to feed through into the labour market, although improvements here have in some countries been too slow to appear. It is evident, however, that economic growth alone will not reduce the urgency to proceed with structural adjustments in order to tackle unacceptably high rates of unemployment. As regards monetary and financial developments in the euro area, the annual growth rate of the broad money supply (M3H) accelerated in April to around 6% from 5.5% in March. The growth rate of M1, the narrow money supply, also picked up, to around 10%. We shall monitor these developments very carefully. In principle, the economic performance I have just described provides a favourable environment for continued fiscal consolidation. It is with some concern that we observe that in a number of member countries the prospects for this to actually develop seem to be, to put it mildly, rather subdued. In this respect, I should like to underline three aspects. First, any ""growth dividend"" resulting from the current cyclical upturn should be used to bring deficit and debt levels down, rather than relaxing control over expenditure. Second, most Member States need to go a step further, and indeed improve structural balances as they are not yet in compliance with the obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact. This implies that the benchmark for fiscal policy must now be a budget close to balance or in surplus - in surplus especially in countries with high ratios of debt to GDP. Third, further structural adjustments in fiscal policy would also help to improve the policy mix in some countries and in the euro area as a whole from the start of Stage Three. I would not at the present time want to try to convey too strong an impression of the implications of these various economic developments for the appropriate stance of monetary policies in euro area Member States. Although the responsibility for these policies remains with national central banks until the end of this year, the Governing Council had an extensive and thorough discussion on a euro area perspective of monetary policy. We will continue to study this issue closely before we enter the regime of a single monetary policy. For the time being, it is encouraging to see the credibility of monetary policy being reflected in the exchange rates of euro countries. There is currently no sign of exchange rate tensions among euro area currencies. Forward exchange rates are expected to be virtually identical to central rates, suggesting that the pre-announced rates are considered credible. I consider this a remarkable achievement. Following its review of economic developments, the Governing Council settled a number of organisational issues. It adopted the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank. These will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities; It approved, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, the establishment of eleven ESCB committees to assist in the work of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The committees are as follows (listed in alphabetical order): Accounting and Monetary Income Committee, Banking Supervision Committee, Banknote Committee, External Communications Committee, Information Technology Committee, Internal Auditors Committee, Legal Committee, Market Operations Committee, Monetary Policy Committee, Payment and Settlement Systems Committee, and Statistics Committee; It formally adopted a budget for the European Central Bank for the second half of 1998 and agreed on the establishment of a Budget Committee to assist the Governing Council in ECB budget-related matters; It laid down specific rules applicable to staff transferring from the European Monetary Institute to the European Central Bank. ECB Decisions relating to the Conditions of Employment will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The Governing Council also took a number of decisions relating to various aspects of its preparatory work for Stage Three. The Governing Council decided on the introduction of a minimum reserve system by the ESCB at the start of Stage Three. Among the three main functions that a minimum reserve system could usefully perform, the Governing Council attaches particularly high importance to its contributions to the stabilisation of money market interest rates and to the enlargement of the demand for central bank money by creating or enlarging a structural liquidity shortage in the market. In the light of the potential burden which a minimum reserve system could impose on the private sector and the effects it might have on the financial activity of credit institutions in the euro area, the Governing Council has decided on features which fulfil the two money market management purposes outlined above, while at the same time allowing an adequate remuneration of minimum reserves. A number of details of the minimum reserve system that will be applied were already specified in previous documents published by the European Monetary Institute. Additional features agreed upon yesterday include the liability base, the lump-sum allowance and the rate of remuneration. With regard to the latter, the ECB will remunerate minimum reserve holdings at a level corresponding to the rate of its main refinancing operations. The Governing Council intends to decide on the exact specification of the minimum reserve system in November 1998 at the latest. This decision, in particular as regards the reserve ratio (which is currently defined within a range of 1.5% - 2.5%), will be based on the early data from the new system for money and banking statistics. Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning. It is intended that the precise features of the minimum reserve system will be published in the form of an EU Council Regulation. For this purpose, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Recommendation for an EU Council Regulation on the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank. In accordance with the provisions of the Statute of the ESCB, the EU Council, acting by a qualified majority and after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, is expected to adopt this Regulation. The Governing Council also adopted ECB Recommendations for EU Council Regulations concerning the collection of statistical information by the ECB and concerning the powers of the ECB to impose sanctions. All three ECB Recommendations will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities for general notice. The Governing Council decided on the size and form of the initial transfer of foreign reserve assets to the European Central Bank from the national central banks participating in the euro area. This transfer is to take place on the first day of 1999. It has been decided that the initial transfer will be to the maximum allowed amount of EUR 50 billion, adjusted downwards by deducting the shares in the ECB's capital subscription key of the EU central banks which will not participate in the euro area at the outset. The transfer will thus be equal to 78.9153% of EUR 50 billion, i.e. approximately EUR 39.46 billion. The Governing Council furthermore agreed that this initial transfer should be in gold in an amount equivalent to 15% of the sum I have just mentioned, with the remaining 85% being transferred in foreign currency assets. I should stress that the decision on the percentage of gold to be transferred to the ECB will have no implications for the consolidated gold holdings of the ESCB. The precise modalities of the initial transfer will be finalised before the end of the year. Before the end of the current year the Governing Council will also have to adopt an ECB Guideline pursuant to Article 31.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, which will subject all operations in foreign reserve assets remaining with the national central banks -including gold - to approval by the ECB. In connection with the setting-up of common market standards, the Governing Council also reached agreement on a number of issues related to the quotation and publication of reference exchange rates for the euro. Specifically, it was agreed to recommend to market participants the ""certain"" method for quoting the exchange rates for the euro (i.e. 1 euro = X foreign currency units) and to have daily reference exchange rates for the euro computed and published by the ECB. Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning. The Governing Council decided on the conditions for the participation of the non-euro area EU central banks and credit institutions in the TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer) system. In TARGET the ESCB will provide central bank liquidity in the course of the day (i.e. intraday liquidity) to the extent necessary to avoid delays in the execution of payment orders. If intraday liquidity is not reimbursed at the end of the day it becomes overnight credit granted by the ESCB, which, for evident monetary policy reasons, cannot be offered to institutions outside the euro area. Nonetheless, non-euro area EU central banks and institutions in those countries will be connected to TARGET. The Governing Council considered that giving such institutions outside the euro area unlimited access to intraday credit would have created risks for the conduct of monetary policy that it was not ready to take. A facility will therefore be put in place to enable the non-euro area EU central banks to provide collateralised intraday credit in euro to their credit institutions, subject to a ceiling both at the level of the non-euro area EU central banks and at that of non-euro area credit institutions. There will also be a liquidity deadline, set at 5 p.m., for non-euro area credit institutions so that they do not incur an overnight overdraft in euro. Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning. The Governing Council also agreed that a report on recent developments in the field of electronic money - and their monetary policy implications - would be published in September 1998. Finally, the Governing Council agreed on a number of legal instruments aimed at enhancing the protection of euro banknotes. In particular, an ECB Decision on the denominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of banknotes has been adopted, as well as an ECB Recommendation regarding the adoption of certain measures to enhance the legal protection of euro banknotes and coins. Both documents will be published for general information in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning. We are at your disposal for further questions. "
1998-06-09,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to report on the outcome of the first meetings of the three decision-making bodies of the ECB: the General Council; the Governing Council; and, the Executive Board; all of which, in accordance with the ESCB/ECB Statute, are chaired by me, as President of the ECB, or, in my absence, by the Vice-President, who is sitting next to me. I may recall that the Heads of State or Government appointed six members to the Executive Board of the ECB, including the President and the Vice-President, as from 1 June 1998, which thus constitutes the date of establishment not only of the ECB but also of the ESCB. I may also recall that on 4 June 1998 the Executive Board released a press statement announcing its 2 June 1998 decision on the distribution of responsibilities among its members for the business areas of the ECB. In subsequent meetings of the Executive Board the first meetings of the Governing and the General Councils were prepared. The first meetings of both bodies were held earlier today. Further information about the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB, about the constitution of the ESCB, about its objectives and tasks, and about its organisation has been made available in a press folder and can also be found on the ECBs Web site [section About the ECB]. The General Council, which includes all fifteen EU national central bank governors, provisionally adopted its own Rules of Procedure. They will be formally approved at the next meeting of the General Council. In accordance with Article 47 of the ESCB/ECB Statute, the General Council also made a contribution to the decision-making of the Governing Council. For this reason the General Council met before the Governing Council. The contribution consisted in delivering opinions on two important institutional matters: (i) the key for the subscription of the capital of the ECB; (ii) the Conditions of Employment of ECB staff. At the end of its meeting, the General Council agreed, for the remainder of this year, to meet on 1 September 1998 and on 1 December 1998. Following the meeting of the General Council, the Governing Council met for the first time in its composition of the six members of the Executive Board and the governors of the eleven national central banks of the euro area. Mr. de Silguy participated in the meeting as a member of the European Commission; the President of the EU Council, who also has a right to attend, did not participate. The Governing Council: (i) took note of the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank, as proposed by the Executive Board, and will revert to them at its next meeting; (ii) it adopted three Decisions: - the first Decision relates to the method to be applied for determining the national central banks percentage shares in the key for the ECBs capital. Application of this method has resulted in shares for the fifteen EU national central banks being determined with a level of precision of four decimal places; I will not read out the details, however, this information is being made available. - the second Decision relates to the measures necessary for the paying up of the capital of the ECB. It has been decided that the eleven national central banks of the euro area will pay up in full their respective subscriptions to the ECBs capital according to the key established in the preceding Decision and that they will do so by 1 July 1998. As a result, the ECB will be endowed with an initial capital of slightly under EUR 4 billion; - the third Decision consists in recommending to the Council of the European Union the first external auditor of the European Central Bank. These and future Decisions will obviously be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities for general notice. The Governing Council also decided on a number of organisational matters: (i) it laid down the Conditions of Employment of the staff of the European Central Bank; (ii) it provisionally agreed on a budget for the European Central Bank for the second half of 1998, which will be formally adopted at the next meeting; (iii) it agreed on the framework for the organisation of the overall testing of ESCB-wide systems and procedures which will be conducted in the second half of this year, so as to ensure that the ESCB is in a position to undertake its tasks as from 1 January 1999. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided on two specific issues relating to the preparation of Stage Three: (i) with respect to the TARGET system, a pricing policy was agreed, the main element of which is the degressive tariff that will be applied to payment transactions flowing through this system. A separate press release, which will be made available in all Community languages, will provide further details on this matter; (ii) with respect to the euro banknotes, a largely decentralised approach for the initial supply of such banknotes has been agreed upon. This means that each of the eleven national central banks of the euro area will be free to organise the industrial process for the production of the euro banknotes needed to replace their national banknotes. In other words, each national central bank may produce all of the relevant euro banknotes itself or, alternatively, it may enter into bilateral pooling arrangements. In addition, the Governing Council was consulted by the Executive Board on the organisational structure of the ECB. The Governing Council took note of, and agreed with, this structure, information about which is being made available. The Governing Council also agreed with the proposals of the Executive Board as regards the appointment of ECB Managers. I should like to point out that, of the fifty-five managerial positions in the ECB, forty-nine will be recruited from the current EMI staff. Finally, the Governing Council decided, for the remainder of this year, to meet in any event on the first Tuesday of every month, with the exception of the month of August. Thus the next meeting of the Governing Council is scheduled for 7 July 1998. Before that date, more precisely on 30 June 1998, there will be a ceremony to be held in the Alte Oper in Frankfurt to mark the establishment of the ESCB. For the remainder of this year the Governing Council will have to decide on all elements of the so-called regulatory, organisational and logistical framework necessary for the ESCB to perform its tasks in Stage Three, which the EMI has prepared in accordance with the Treaty. To this end, the Executive Board is currently preparing a work programme, which will cover, inter alia, such items as: (i) the decision on whether or not to introduce a minimum reserve system and the specification of its features; (ii) the monetary policy strategy; (iii) the procedural rules for the administration of ERM2; (iv) the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB; (v) the provision of intraday liquidity to non-euro area national central banks of the EU in the TARGET system; (vi) the technical specification for the euro banknotes; (vii) the scope and format of the financial reporting of the ESCB; (viii) the allocation of the ESCBs monetary income. You will understand that, after nine days of ECB existence, I am not yet in a position to give you further details on the precise timing of the decision-making on the above and many other items to be addressed by the Governing Council.
