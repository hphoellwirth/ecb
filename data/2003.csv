2003-12-04,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Following a comprehensive economic and monetary analysis, we concluded that the monetary policy stance remains appropriate to preserve price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we left the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their low levels. While annual inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around 2% over the coming months, a gradual and limited decline should take place later on. We also noted that the economic recovery in the euro area has started and that confidence has strengthened further. We will continue to carefully monitor all developments that might affect our medium-term assessment of risks to price stability. We also discussed the potential implications of the deeply regrettable developments at the ECOFIN Council meeting on 25 November. As we already stressed in our statement on the same day, these developments risk undermining the credibility of the institutional framework and the confidence in sound public finances of Member States across the euro area. Let me add that a credible fiscal framework is key not only to stability but also to growth, and is a precondition for low risk premia in financial markets to be preserved. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data releases confirmed that economic activity in the euro area has picked up. Real GDP growth in the third quarter reflects the strong momentum of the world economy, which we assume will continue next year. We expect that domestic demand will start improving. Private consumption should be supported by positive terms-of-trade effects due to the past appreciation of the euro. With the usual lag, it should also profit from an increase in employment growth. Business investment is expected to recover gradually, mainly helped by an expansion of external demand, the low level of interest rates and generally favourable financing conditions. Moreover, it should increasingly benefit from the adjustment efforts of the corporate sector to enhance productivity and profitability. Taken together, we look forward to a gradual recovery in euro area economic growth over the next quarters, leading to a broader and stronger upswing in the course of next year and the year after. The risks to this scenario appear to be balanced. Over a longer horizon, we remain concerned about the sustainability of global economic growth being undermined by external imbalances in some parts of the world economy. Concerning prices, the latest information is in line with earlier expectations. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in November, following a rate of 2.0% in October. Similar rates have prevailed for most of this year and this inertia of inflation rates at around 2% is likely to continue in the coming months. Due to adverse food price developments, the evolution of oil prices and planned increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, inflation rates will fall neither as quickly nor as strongly as was expected earlier in the year. However, when assessing price trends over the medium term, a number of factors should dampen inflationary pressures. First, given the past appreciation of the euro, import prices should contribute to this effect. Second, domestic cost pressures should remain moderate. In particular, wage growth should be contained in the context of a recovery which, for the time being, is expected to remain gradual. Provided that wage moderation can be preserved, which is indispensable for fostering employment, a cyclical recovery in productivity tends to dampen growth in unit labour costs, which has thus far been relatively high when judged against the weakness of the economy. Overall, these views are also reflected in recently released forecasts and seem to be in line with survey data and financial market expectations. Accordingly, there is a rather broad consensus on the main scenario. At the same time, this outlook for price stability is conditional on quite a number of assumptions, such as those on global developments, oil prices, exchange rates, wage developments and fiscal measures. Therefore, elements of risk to the outlook for price stability need to be kept in mind. In this respect, we noted that financial market indicators for inflation expectations have shown some upward momentum over recent months. While technical factors might also have played a role in the movement of these indicators, and other indicators have remained broadly unchanged, inflation expectations warrant close monitoring. Turning to the monetary analysis, M3 growth has been very strong over the past two years, reflecting portfolio shifts, precautionary savings and the low level of interest rates. The low level of interest rates has also supported the growth of credit demand. In our assessment, the accumulation of excess liquidity is not of concern for price stability at the current juncture, given that, for the time being, the economic recovery is only gradual. However, should high excess liquidity continue to prevail once there is a significant strengthening of economic activity, it could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term. We will therefore continue to carefully examine monetary developments. In summary, the economic analysis indicates that the main scenario for price developments in the medium term continues to be in line with our definition of price stability. This picture is confirmed by cross-checking with the monetary analysis. Turning to fiscal policies, I have already mentioned that we expressed deep regret following the ECOFIN Council meeting on 25 November. Furthermore, we stressed our support of the Commission's views on the ECOFIN Council's Conclusions. We also took note of the commitments made by France and Germany to correct their excessive deficits as rapidly as possible and at the latest by 2005. Moreover, we noted that the ECOFIN Council stands ready to take a decision under Article 104(9), on the basis of the Commission recommendation, should the two governments fail to act in accordance with their own commitments. We strongly urge the governments concerned to live up to their responsibilities. Confidence in the soundness of public finances is essential for sustainable growth in consumption and investment. The overall fiscal framework of the Stability and Growth Pact remains of central importance and should be fully respected. The same applies to the requirement to avoid excessive deficits, laid down in Article 104 of the Treaty, and to the reference values of 3% and 60% for the deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios respectively, specified in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty. These are the foundations for trust and confidence in EMU. Trust and confidence are also crucial in the context of structural reform. Enhancing the competitiveness of the euro area, in particular in labour and product markets, increasing the efficiency of the tax systems and ensuring the sustainability of social security schemes all foster a better allocation and utilisation of capital and human resources. There is no doubt that measures in these respects improve the growth perspectives of the euro area. However, in order to foster confidence in the shorter term, convincing assurance must be given that these challenges are indeed being tackled in a decisive manner and that clear action is being taken. While some progress has been made, the Governing Council strongly encourages governments to accelerate the implementation of structural reforms and also calls upon social partners to fully commit themselves to the objective of making the euro area a more dynamic and innovative economy. We are now at your disposal for questions. Well, first of all I would say that we have expressed ourselves sufficiently clearly in real time not to have to elaborate too much on our analysis today. I repeated a moment ago that we are sticking to the analysis and to the diagnosis we produced in real time, immediately after the developments that took place in the ECOFIN meeting. What we consider to be of the utmost importance in the present circumstances, of course, is that – as we say – each partner should live up to its responsibility. I do not want to comment any more on what would happen if the commitments are not met. It is said in the decision, which was taken by the majority, the qualified majority of the Council, as I have just mentioned, that in that case the recommendations according to Article 104 (9) of the Treaty would be decided upon by the very same majority because they committed themselves to doing that. And then we are in the ""sequencing"" of respecting the prescription of the Stability and Growth Pact. I do not want to elaborate further on that. Well, you cannot separate the form, the procedure and the substance. All are intertwined in such circumstances. And it was taking account of the full package, with all the elements concerned, that we said what we said: that we regret those developments and that we took note of the commitments that I just mentioned. The commitment by the countries concerned and the commitment by the majority, the qualified majority itself. Thank you very much. First of all, I already said here that I will not comment on the day-to-day and week-to-week evolution of currencies on markets. We are living, as you know, in a system which is a floating exchange rate system. That being said, I already said that we – all the central banks in the world – are pursuing strategies, long-term strategies, aimed at delivering stable and strong currencies. And this is done by all central banks on both sides of the Atlantic, for instance, because it makes it possible to gain the confidence of investors and savers. It is very important to obtain this: very low risk premiums on the medium and long-term rates, in particular, and preserving or enforcing the favourable financial environment, which is of course one of the elements that is important for growth and job creation. So I will not elaborate more than that. I do not see at all what you are suggesting or alluding to. I am not aware at all of that and it is not in line with what I have just said and what is the present rule of the game. We had Pedro Solbes with us. You know that we invite the Commissioner and also the Eurogroup to our meetings, and they come from time to time. We did not have any report on what you have just said. We had a report on how Pedro was looking at the situation at this stage. But nothing to comment on what you have just indicated. I have already said what our analysis is. So you have all the elements that are guiding our policy. Everybody knows what our benchmark is; we give and display our definition of price stability; everybody can see what the various data are that we might have in mind; and it is absolutely clear that we take our own decisions on the basis of our own responsibilities. What we have done until now – and I repeat it because it seems to me that it is important – is to permit 305 million citizens of Europe to benefit from a financial environment with objectively low medium and long-term rates that did not exist before the euro. We had much higher rates in various economies, and this of course is gained through confidence and credibility in the long-term stability of the currency. This success we had in shipping to the euro, and to the yield curve of the euro, the credibility and confidence accumulated in those areas of Europe with the highest levels of credibility and confidence is, I would say, a very, very important success. Perhaps the first success of the euro. And it is for that reason that we trust that, when we take our decisions on the basis of this aim of preserving and reinforcing confidence, not only are we, of course, doing what we are called upon to do, namely maintaining price stability, but we are also creating an environment favourable to growth and job creation, as I just mentioned. Our analysis, as I said, is that the private sector, the competitive sector has done a lot to reinforce competitiveness and to reinforce profitability. And it is clear that the last few years have been really dedicated to making these efforts, after the previous episode in the cycle which had been very buoyant and active, as you know. We trust, as I said, that investment will now probably be observed, and we trust that the growth that we have in mind, and that all observers have in mind, will be fostered by consumption, and also by investment. So we expect to observe a progressive, gradual pick-up of investment. That is clear. First of all, as you rightly say at the end of the question: these are projections. These are not forecasts, as you know. And we consider these projections, which are made at the level of the full body of the Eurosystem – by the staff of the ECB and the staff of the NCBs. These are an important task of the staff, and we had them in mind when we took the decision this morning. I will not elaborate on the figures because we will, as you know, publish them next week in the Monthly Bulletin. All I can say at this stage is that we had in mind, in particular, the fact that inertia of inflation would, as I said a moment ago, be observed in the next few months. And it is something which was confirmed by the projections I have just mentioned. I have already said that: you might remember that a month ago I used – if I am not mistaken – the word ""stickiness"". So we know, and we have known for a certain period of time, that as far as inflation was concerned we had inertia, persistence of inflation around 2%, and that is something that we explain to ourselves – I do not want to elaborate more – with the price of oil, some increase in the price of processed and unprocessed food, and indirect taxation. These are the three main reasons why we should observe a level of inflation during the next few months which is above what we had projected before, which is what all observers had projected before, because they did not take into account the three elements that I have just mentioned. And everybody knows and understands why these elements will be influencing this inertia of inflation during the next few months. That being said, it has not led us, as you have seen, to modify the judgement and the stance of monetary policy. The present stance of monetary policy is correct. There are no indiscreet questions but only indiscreet answers, perhaps! I will not comment more on the euro/dollar relationship than I have already done. And, of course, when we judge the situation we take account of all data, all parameters, all information – as you know – and they all play a role, including the exchange rate, together with the fiscal position and all the other elements, the global environment, and all the elements we have from outside and inside the euro area. We are as comprehensive as possible, as you know, in our economic analysis and we are also, and this is very important, never prisoner of a particular equation, of a particular system of equations, or of a particular algorithm. No, there is no discrepancy. Our judgement is that we have to remain vigilant, and that is clearly the situation. We mentioned this on account of a number of elements, including – as you mentioned – inflationary expectations, which are of course something that we have to look at very carefully. That being said, we maintain that the monetary policy stance is correct and in line with our monetary policy, our concept of monetary policy. To the first question I will say only that there is a consensus that the situation is not to be changed. On the second question I would say that we consider – as I said – that the strength of the recovery that we see operating since the start of the second half – and has been confirmed by the first estimates for growth in the third quarter, will continue, and I would say that we are not – as I said – prisoners of any kind of figures, forecasts or equations. My own sentiment is that it is quite likely that growth will accelerate over the next year and I certainly would hope that we will reach the level of our growth potential – but I will certainly not say when. Well, on the first point. We have not changed our diagnosis and, as I have said, we stick to the diagnosis we produced in real time. We have taken note, as I said, of the commitments made by the countries concerned. And we will continue, in our domain, to do all that is needed to fulfil our mandate and to preserve and reinforce confidence. And our judgement is that confidence is perhaps the most important ingredient at the present juncture, if I may say so. Because we have a lot of elements that are positive in the overall European economy and in the euro area economy. We have savings, we have capital, we have human resources, we have women and men who are qualified, and we also have an external environment which is more conducive to growth than before. So, what we would consider a key element would be confidence. And we are responsible for a part of this confidence, of course. And the part for which we are responsible we try to deliver in the best fashion possible. As regards the growth differential between the United States and Europe, I will not elaborate too much on that. I will only say that in the analysis of the ECB, of the Governing Council of the ECB, of the full body of the Eurosystem, and of – to my knowledge and I am speaking with the Vice-President here – all institutions, observers and academics analysing the situation, we could improve the growth potential if we were to embark as actively as possible on the structural reforms we have mentioned. We have said that we are backing the structural reforms. Some reforms have been carried out already, and we are very happy that they have been, and we have backed the governments and the parliaments that embarked on these reforms. Others have still to be implemented, and we have backed the process of reform which is now on its way. But of course there remains a lot to be done if we want to achieve a better growth potential, better growth, and better job creation. I have already said that we encompass absolutely all data, all information, all elements that are of importance, so I would say that we have taken everything into consideration and we made a working assumption, as I said, that the commitments that were made by the countries concerned and the commitments that were made by the qualified majority of the Council are to be met 100% ... that is of course our working assumption. Again, we all have our own responsibilities. We call on all partners to live up to their responsibilities. We say what we believe we have to say and everybody will take responsibility for his own actions. We have the Commission, we have the Council, we have parliaments, we have the European Parliament and we have the ECB – with our own responsibilities – all of which are important in certain domains and which are of course under the scrutiny of everybody, yourself and the full body of public opinion. We say what we believe we have to say, and you are right in saying that we will not change our own vision. It is perhaps the particular responsibility of central banks always to say more or less the same thing. I know that it might be a little bit boring for you when you hear us repeating ourselves but it is perhaps better to repeat when you really believe that it is important. And, after all, communication is also about repeating things. On the first point, I would say that we consider that this inertia of inflation over the next months – and ""next months"" might in fact mean several months – is, as you have suggested, due to factors that would not necessarily be there were a certain period of time to elapse, and we consider that over the longer run we are in line with our definition of price stability. That is clearly our analysis today. That being said, of course, we remain vigilant for all the reasons that have been expressed, and again our vigilance is the best recipe for the confidence that I mentioned earlier, and that confidence in turn is giving rise to a better level of confidence among savers, investors, consumers and so forth. For that is important for growth and for job creation. As regards TARGET 2, I will only mention that we are following very, very carefully, of course, the evolution of this project and I am very optimistic that we will be able to deliver a system which will be both on time and very good. I have already said what I wanted to say on the euro-dollar relationship, and have nothing to add to this. Trichet:(Translation from French) You have seen what we said today, which is completely in line with what we had said before, as has already been mentioned, and we are sticking to our own analysis, where we have been as level-headed as possible and where we have stated that we indeed believe that what is in the Treaty and what is in the Stability and Growth Pact is very important for all the reasons that I have already mentioned. (In English) I only mentioned the fact that we had already said that the Stability and Growth Pact was important, as was the Treaty, and today we are reiterating that. We will stick to this position, as was discussed by my colleagues this morning. Furthermore, I should once again like to say that it is up to all partners to assume their responsibility and we firmly believe that it is important to have this concept and this Treaty and Stability and Growth Pact framework. As we have said today in the Governing Council, these are the foundations for trust and confidence in EMU. "
2003-11-06,Trichet,"Ladies and gentlemen, Today marks the first time that I had the honour and the pleasure of chairing the meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. I am delighted to now proceed with our well-established practice of real-time communication and to report on the outcome of our meeting, together with the Vice-President. Following our regular economic and monetary analysis, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their low levels. Overall, we anticipate some further stickiness of inflation rates in the shorter term, while the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favourable. Against this background, we continue to judge the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate. At the same time, we see additional signs of a gradual economic recovery in the euro area. We will carefully monitor all developments that might affect our assessment of risks to price stability. Let me now explain our decision in more detail. Starting with the economic analysis, new data and other information show that the recovery of the world economy is clearly making progress. Also for the euro area, the indicators are increasingly pointing towards some improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. For the time being, this is primarily reflected in business surveys and leading indicators, but we expect that forthcoming data on euro area production and demand will confirm that a gradual recovery has started. Taken together, we see further confirmation of our main scenario of a gradual improvement in economic activity this year, and a broadening and strengthening in the course of 2004. This assessment has received support from recently published forecasts of official and private sources, as well as from developments in financial markets. Externally, the expansion of global economic trade and real GDP growth should counteract the changes in the effective exchange rate of the euro, which is back to its level of early 1999. Domestically, the conditions for investment should improve further, given the continued adjustment efforts of firms to enhance productivity and profitability, the low level of interest rates and generally favourable financing conditions. Moreover, private consumption should benefit from real disposable income growth, fostered by positive terms-of-trade effects stemming from the past appreciation of the euro. The short-term risks to our main scenario appear to be balanced. Over a longer horizon, we remain concerned about the sustainability of global economic growth being undermined by persisting imbalances. This relates, in particular, to the sustainability of public finances and to external imbalances in some regions of the world. Recent inflation rates, measured by the HICP, developed broadly as anticipated. The annual rate of inflation was 2.1% in October, according to Eurostat's flash estimate. It thus remained unchanged from August and September. When looking ahead over the shorter term, it appears that inflation rates may continue to hover around this level for several months to come and, hence, may not fall as quickly and strongly as had been expected up to the summer. Three factors can be identified as contributing to this stickiness of inflation rates. First, in the remainder of 2003 and early 2004, unprocessed food prices could imply some limited upward pressure as a consequence of this summer's heat wave. Second, oil prices remain higher than expected, owing to political uncertainties in the Middle East. Last but not least, in the course of 2004, planned increases in indirect taxes and administered prices in some euro area countries will have an upward impact on inflation. However, when taking into account more lasting factors, we continue to expect inflation rates to moderate over the medium term and to develop in line with price stability. This expectation is based on the assumption that wage developments will not be affected by the current inertia of inflation rates, and will remain moderate in the context of a gradual economic recovery. Moreover, the past appreciation of the euro should continue to dampen price pressures. These views are also reflected in recently released forecasts. At the same time, inflation expectations warrant close monitoring. Turning to the monetary analysis, after an extended period of strong M3 growth, liquidity in the euro area remains ample, despite a certain slowdown in monetary expansion over recent months. This situation of persistently more liquidity than is needed to finance non-inflationary economic growth reflects past portfolio shifts, precautionary savings and the low level of interest rates. The low level of interest rates also supported the annual growth of loans to the private sector, which fluctuated between 4½% and 5% in recent months. At the current juncture, the accumulation of excess liquidity is not of concern for price stability, given the economic outlook. However, if it were to continue in conjunction with a significant strengthening of economic activity, it could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term. Cross-checking the information from the two pillars, our economic analysis indicates that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favourable, in the context of a gradual economic recovery and moderate import price and wage developments. In view of the economic situation, the strong monetary expansion should not, for the time being, be seen as adversely affecting this outlook. Fiscal developments and the Stability and Growth Pact are now at a critical point at which the credibility of the institutional underpinnings of EMU must be maintained. The Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact provide an appropriate framework for ensuring fiscal discipline, within adequate bounds of flexibility. The deficit reference value of 3% of GDP, which is laid down in the Maastricht Treaty itself, is the nominal anchor for the rules and procedures governing fiscal policies in the EU. This anchor must not be placed in doubt. Fully abiding by the rules and implementing them in every respect has very solid economic justifications, and is not a mere procedural matter. Upholding trust in the soundness of public finances enhances confidence of all economic agents and thereby contributes to sustainable growth in consumption and investment. Stability and growth are thus not conflicting objectives, but rather reinforce each other – a fact which is very well captured in the title of the fiscal framework called the ""Stability and Growth Pact"". Concerning recent developments in the context of the excessive deficit procedure, it is the view of the Governing Council that the proposals of the Commission push the room for interpretation of the rules and procedures to the limit. As regards future decisions, which are expected in the course of November, the Governing Council strongly urges each institution and government concerned to live up to their responsibilities. It is the overall credibility of the fiscal framework and, hence, the prospects for economic growth in the euro area that are at stake. Fiscal consolidation plans are best placed within a comprehensive and credible medium-term strategy. This requires strong emphasis on structural expenditure reforms and the adaptation of public pension and health systems to the challenges arising from the ageing of the population. Moreover, structural reforms in the labour and product markets are needed to allow a better allocation and utilisation of capital and human resources, and to enhance the euro area's growth potential. The Governing Council strongly supports current efforts by a number of governments in this direction and also encourages social partners to fully commit themselves to the objective of making the euro area a more dynamic and innovative economy. We are now at your disposal for questions. I will have exactly the same tradition, a very strong tradition, as my predecessor Wim Duisenberg. And I want to tell you how happy I am to have the legacy of the previous chair. We are a team, a team of 18 members of the Governing Council, and we all agree on the concept that we are applying. I am very happy with remarks that are made here and there; I have to say that I very often read very different views on my own posture. But I would say that I have the full legacy of Wim and that the Governing Council is of course in a spirit of continuity. Thank you. (Translation from French) Just very briefly I would like to say that we follow a strategy of a stable euro, a strong euro and a euro that inspires confidence. That is the strategy we follow, a strong, stable euro that inspires confidence. And by inspiring confidence we have market rates which are low both in the medium and in the long term, we inspire confidence among savers and that also creates a financial environment which is favourable to growth and to job creation. By having a euro that inspires confidence we also maintain the purchasing power of consumers and we therefore have consumers who find that they have more capacity to consume. And we have more investment and more consumption – all else being equal. (In English) I can say it in English, I think it would be better because all journalists do not have access to translation. If we have a policy of a strong and stable euro, which is the policy we are pursuing, we are paving the way in the medium and long run for medium and long-term rates that are at a lower level and we are creating an environment which is favourable to growth and job creation. Through confidence in the currency, we have confidence in the savers' constituency. Through confidence in the currency, we have confidence in the investors' constituency. Through confidence in the currency, we are paving the way for medium and long-term sustainable growth, job-creating growth, which is of course something that you get out of price stability. I will respond, if you permit me, both in English, first, because there are a lot of people that understand English here, and then in French. First of all, on the first question, which deals with the Stability and Growth Pact, I will say that we had a very clear position in the Governing Council, among the 18 members of the Governing Council, and you have it in writing, but I will repeat it because it seems to me that it is important. We expect and we urge each institution and government to live up to their responsibilities. There are responsibilities according to the Treaty, there are responsibilities according to the Stability and Growth Pact, and we are urging every partner institution and entity concerned to live up to their responsibility. We think that living up to responsibility would improve and not deteriorate growth prospects in Europe. Because, again, it would improve confidence, and confidence – as I have already said – is the key to growth. (Translation from French) If you permit, I will say it in French as well. We said very clearly that we were expecting and that we were asking each of our partners to live up fully to their responsibilities. And if I say partners, that includes all partners, all institutions and entities concerned. Because we feel that their living up to their responsibilities, in accordance with the Pact and with the Treaty, is an important factor in confidence – in Europe and in the euro area – and that this confidence is one of the key factors for creating growth and jobs, for all the reasons I have already mentioned. As regards the stickiness of inflation, which was the second question, where does that stickiness of inflation come from? I would say only that we are observing at least three factors that might explain this stickiness. One is unprocessed food prices, and everybody knows why we have this problem and where it comes from. Another element is associated with the oil price, and we also see how we can explain that the oil price development has worsened or is not as favourable as we had hoped. The third element might be indirect taxation in a number of European economies. It is also true that the service sector in particular, being less, I would say, under the pressure of competition and particularly global competition, is a sector where we are observing stickiness of inflation. Well, to the first point I would say that if we had wished to say that we thought the Commission had not behaved properly, we would have said that. So we only said that they had pushed to the limit the Stability and Growth Pact. And if you permit me, I will say nothing more than what I said a moment ago. As regards your second question, you know that we meet in a format that examines monetary policy every month, and we said very clearly that we will monitor developments at each of these meetings. So I would not say anything else but that at the present time we judge interest rates to be appropriate for the reasons I have stated. We are reasonably confident that despite the stickiness of inflation right now, the prospects are for price stability, and that is why we think we have interest rates that are appropriate at a time when we are observing some other decisions in the rest the world. Question (translation): Mr. President, the US current account deficit is still there. Do you see a risk to a sustainable recovery of the global economy? There is a strong fiscal and monetary stimulus going on, which must disappear at some time. Well, we all, of course, have assets and liabilities, if I may, chances and risks on the various continents, in the various big, or small, economies. And as far as the US economy is concerned, it is true that there is a certain lack of savings, an element which is reflected in the current account. We have mentioned imbalances. As regards Europe, as you know, we do not have this kind of imbalance. But we have structural impediments that are precisely what are creating some of our challenges. And that is the reason why we insist very much on structural reforms in Europe. And we insist on them – again, of course, on this occasion – as these structural reforms are one of the main challenges we must tackle, as was agreed at the Lisbon meeting of the European Council, in order to increase the growth potential of Europe and have a better economy with higher growth and, of course, higher job creation. Well, we are dealing with Europe, if you permit me, and Europe is our responsibility here. It is clear that in periods of very intense technological change in a flexible economy you have the display of rapid productivity progress, productivity increases. These rapid productivity increases themselves are paving the way for buoyant growth, or active growth, or more active and dynamic growth. And, therefore, they are welcome. As regards the European economy today – and this is the assessment not only of the ECB, but also of other authorities, and here I am referring to the Lisbon consensus – clearly we believe that more efforts being made in research and development, in technology, in creativity, innovation and so forth, would permit more rapid progress in productivity and would, therefore, increase the growth potential, which – as I have said – is probably one of the main challenges that we have here in Europe today. Question (translation): Mr. President, you are at the beginning of a long term in office and surely you have thought about what you would like to achieve during this period and have set goals for yourself. What goals have you set for yourself, for these eight years, quite a long period, and which of these goals would you like to attain under all circumstances? If you permit me, I will respond in English in order to avoid any misunderstanding. First of all, as I have said, we are a team. I am – and this is very, very important, es ist eine grosse Ehre (it is a great honour) – I am the captain of the team, so to speak. But the captain is a member of the team. And we are acting together, we are delivering together the kind of credible currency that the Treaty asks us to deliver. So, I see myself as maintaining the continuity of the previous chairmanship, captaincy of the ECB. Second, it is obvious that we face very, very big challenges, and we have to cope with these very big challenges. One challenge is, of course, our fundamental duty, namely delivering price stability, and price stability – and I do not want to go back again why – price stability is the necessary precondition, through various channels, for growth, for job creation, for sustainable growth in the medium and long run. Third, we certainly have to try to help with regard to what I would call one of the very important challenges, not for the ECB itself, but for Europe as a whole, the structural reforms I have mentioned. We need to explain why embarking on structural reforms would enhance the growth potential of Europe, why structural reforms, which are always difficult to implement, are of the essence. Explaining to the general public that those structural reforms, when they are decided, have to be praised and backed is something we trust is important – after our main duty that I have mentioned. More generally, explaining how a market economy works and why moving in such and such a direction is good, I would say, for everybody. We also face another very, very important challenge, which is the European construction itself. We are an institution that is already, if I may, a federal institution in the institutional framework. It is also a very great honour and a very important responsibility for my colleagues and myself, and for Lucas and myself, to be in such a position. We have to cope not only with the proper functioning of the present institution, but also with enlargement – which, comes, I have to say, very, very soon. As you know, next year, we will have 25 members of the General Council of the ECB, with colleagues coming from ten new national central banks. They are already around the table in the General Council today. And this, of course, illustrates a kind of challenge you have when you are, my colleagues and myself, part of an important institution in a Europe that is moving, and moving in a way which has no historical precedent. This, again, is per se a very important challenge. First of all, I would say that, as you know, all responsible central banks are pursuing policies that are oriented towards long-term strong currency. You cannot find any central bank in the world which would say that they would prefer to have a weak currency. It would immediately trigger a refusal of investors and savers to invest in that currency. It would elevate immediately the long-term and medium-term market interest rates. All market interest rates would increase. So it is very important for a central bank to preserve and reinforce confidence, confidence of – I would say – all economic agents, but particularly investors and savers. And I note – en passant – that we say that here, the same, exactly the same reference exists in the other continents. If you ask the United States what is their long-term policy, they would say: we have a solid, strong currency policy. For the very same reasons that are obvious. As regards recent messages, I would not quote any particular currency, if you permit me, but as you know, it was made very, very clear by both Wim Duisenberg here, and by colleagues in the United States that the communiqué which was sent from Dubai was clear, without mentioning any particular currency, that we thought that some Asian currencies could progressively, smoothly and orderly appreciate over time. Vis-à-vis both, I would say, the euro and the dollar, both the dollar and the euro. Thank you very much. To the first question I would say: I would not give you any fear I would say only that we are observing that, for the reasons I have already mentioned – and particularly the three reasons I have already mentioned – we are observing inflation which is – as you know – still over and above 2%, 2.1% in the euro area, which is a little bit over and above what we thought would be the normal evolution a few months ago. So that is the reason why we call it ""stickiness"". As regards the short-term evolution, we clearly see some reasons – the very same reasons might explain – why we would hover at that level, approximately at that level. Again, I am only referring to the overall euro area. Over time, we are more confident, and that is the reason why we say we think that over time we will see inflation in line with our definition of price stability, namely less than 2%, close to 2%. That being said, we will see how this assessment moves, and – as I have said – we meet regularly and we look at the evolution regularly. But at the present moment, we observe stickiness and we are reasonably confident that price stability is ensured. As regards the preparation for this – I would say very impressive – press conference, to be frank, I did not expect that you would be that numerous, I did as I always do. I mean, I am ready and spontaneous in my responses and of course, as you know, this is an exercise where I have to comment on the diagnosis which is made by a collège [the Governing Council], and that diagnosis was made this morning by that collège. So had I wanted to prepare thoroughly the press conference, in any case, I would have had to wait for the diagnosis of the 18 to be worked out, which was done at the end of this morning, if I am not mistaken. Perhaps a little bit after noon. For the Bank of England, Mervyn is ready to respond to any question and I will leave that responsibility with Mervyn. That would be the same for Australia, if you would ask me about Australia. As regards this morning, I would only say, as you know, we stick to the text of that diagnosis that was approved by all of us and I would say to the comma, to the adjective, to the smallest expression of sentiment or nuances, and I will stick to that. Well, as regards Karl Otto Pöhl's judgement, I know Karl Otto and I have known Karl Otto for years, and have great respect for his judgement. Second, I would use the metaphor of sport and the team – the rugby team, let us say, because, the 12 national central banks and the ECB make up a team of 13, as in rugby league. And I like very much that metaphor because it captures the team spirit which is absolutely crucial for our own efficient action. But I also like the navigation metaphor and I would say that, with regard to stormy weather and so forth, we have to be prepared for any environment and I would certainly not want to say what is likely or what is not likely. I leave that to Karl Otto and other observers or actors, but I would say that we have to be prepared. All central banks have to be prepared to operate in conditions that can be very good, or a little bit stormy, or stormy. So the analysis of risks and preparing yourself to respond to the risks is really the rule of the game. That is absolutely clear. Well, again I will stick to the diagnosis that we made because it was our own view. We are in a situation where we think and we say that we are creating an environment which is favourable to growth, favourable to growth because we have financial conditions that are some of the most favourable we have had for 50 years in terms of market rates. And you know that when you look at the historical records. When we look at liquidity in the European economy, we see that it is ample, as we have said. If you look at the dynamics of liquidity, you will see that it is much more dynamic than GDP in value terms. So we have a feeling that, by ensuring price stability and by taking the decisions we have taken in the past, we are really paving the way for, I would say, the financing of growth in Europe to be as easy as possible. And that is something that we want to display. That being said, we say that interest rates are appropriate at the present level, and this is fully in line again with our judgement on the situation taking absolutely everything into account. If I look at the long-term perspective, I would say that it seems to me that the market is convinced that we will deliver that kind of stable long-term environment that is justifying low long and medium-term market rates conducive to growth and job creation. Lucas, would you respond to that question? Papademos: Well, first of all, as you mentioned, the ECB a few weeks ago did express its opinion on the proposed legislation on Suomen Pankki. In particular, we expressed our concerns that the envisaged reduction in the capital and restrictions on how profits are distributed and how provisions are made could have implications for the financial independence of the central bank, and also, more generally, on its institutional independence. At this stage, I think we would like to wait and see what the decision of the Government is because I understand that this is a proposal of the minister, which will be discussed in the Finnish Government council. So until then I do not think it would be appropriate for us to make any further comments and speculate about the outcome. We do hope that the Government will pay close attention to the opinion of the ECB. First of all, I certainly do not want to comment on the day-to-day evolution of stock markets or the day-to-day evolution of any market in particular. So no particular comment on the first question. On the second question, as I said, we observe some stickiness. So I would not, for the beginning of next year, like to make any kind of judgement on what is likely or not likely. We will observe the situation. We know that there is some stickiness, but we are confident since we take a longer-term perspective. Thank you very much. You also have to take into account that Wim had a very good sense of humour! No, I did not take any pill! On the first point, we said very, very clearly that we consider the Stability and Growth Pact to be very important for confidence and how – because it is not only the Pact, but the Treaty itself – a certain behaviour is called for. So, I will not comment further on that. On the one euro banknote we have already said that we would examine this particular question when we look at the new series of banknotes within approximately one year. And I have no further comments at this stage. There are, I would say, pros and cons as regards this possibility and we will look at these very, very carefully. Thank you. Again, we said very carefully that we urge all of them to live up to their responsibilities and I will not elaborate further on that. This is public, we will see what happens and we will make our judgement after we see exactly what happens. But we would urge them to live up to their responsibilities. Thank you. No, I did not say that ... No. To be absolutely clear – on the contrary, we said that at this stage we were observing a certain pick-up in the economy, that at first we had some early indicators and surveys, and that now these have been substantiated with production figures. Of course, we are cautious, we are pragmatic, we will see what the new data, the new facts, the new figures are. But what we are seeing right now – and it is not extraordinary because it is, I would say, the consensus of all economic people and observers – is that there is some kind of pick-up in the economy. Furthermore, we understand pretty well why there is such a pick-up. There are good reasons for this. So, again, we are reasonably confident that since the second semester of this year there has been an element of pick-up and we expect this to continue over time next year and beyond. But I will not mention any figures. Maybe we can have the last three questions. I see that you are very interested in this particular question. I would say the following. First of all, very good decisions were taken by the Executive Board of the ECB under the chairmanship of Wim Duisenberg and with Lucas and other colleagues over the restructuring of DG-IS. There were good decisions taken after due and precise examination and thought. Contacts were instigated with the agents concerned and there was a commitment not to proceed with forced lay-offs. And this has been explained very carefully. I stick to the decision which has been taken by the Executive Board and, once again, I think it was a very good decision and we have to stick to it. We explained that very clearly yesterday, if I am not mistaken. Thank you. ... I am sorry. As regards this particular point, the Staff Rules state that the normal way to organise dialogue with the management of the bank, if I am not mistaken – although I am speaking on a matter that is under the control of Lucas, who will comment on this – is through the Staff Committee. The Staff Committee, which is elected by all of the staff, is the appropriate way of communicating. Lucas, could you elaborate on that? Papademos: As the President has just said, according to the employment contract, staff representation at the ECB is through a Staff Committee which is elected by secret ballot by all members of staff. And with the Staff Committee we have continuous and extensive discussions and negotiations on various issues relating to employment conditions, internal regulations and other subjects relevant to the staff. In addition to the Staff Committee, there is, as you mentioned, a union which has asked to be represented. We do respect the right of staff to organise themselves in unions. And, in an informal way, we have also been in consultation with this union on a variety of issues. However, given the existing conditions, in the past the Executive Board did not feel it appropriate to engage in full discussions with this union. The union challenged this in court and the court upheld the position of the ECB. Thank you very much. And then I have a slight follow-up: you cite what appear to be shocks – you talk about food prices as one shock, oil prices as another, and these administered indirect taxes and so on. Should we see those as shocks and do you see any evidence of second-round effects, of a sort of endogenous inflation pressure, even at this very early stage of an economic upswing? OK, so I will take the first question first, and it is very simple. I will tell you exactly how we see things. But I have to apologise to the other participants, because I will once again read what I have already said, which captures exactly the present sentiment of the Governing Council. When looking ahead over the shorter term, it appears that inflation rates may continue to hover around this level, 2,1%, for several months to come and may thus not fall as quickly and strongly as had been expected up to the summer. However, and this is another part of what I have already said, when taking into account more lasting factors, we continue to expect inflation rates to moderate over the medium term and to develop in line with price stability. This expectation is based on the assumption that wage developments will not be affected by the current inertia of the inflation rates and will remain moderate, even in the context of a gradual economic recovery, which – as I have already said – is our working assumption. And we also note that the past appreciation of the euro should continue to dampen inflationary pressure. These are the reasons why we say that we continue to expect inflation rates to moderate over the medium term. And it seems to me that you have all the nuances that are appropriate in such a, of course, very important judgement that we have collectively made. You had a second question on shocks? Well, we will see: even taking into account the various reasons why there is this stickiness, we continue to say that we are confident it will moderate over the medium term, as I have said. So we are introducing all the elements that could play a role on the other side. But we continue to be confident and this is the reason why we do not change our monetary policy stance. It was a great pleasure to meet with you. Thank you very much indeed. Auf Wiedersehen. "
2003-10-13,Duisenberg,"It is a pleasure for me to be here in Moscow today. While the European Central Bank is among the youngest central banks in the world, we have been actively setting up working relations with foreign central banks since our establishment in July 1998. In particular, we have already established contacts with the Central Bank of Russia, the central bank of a prominent country in what we call the ""Euro Time Zone"". In this context, I should like to stress that today's signing of the TACIS ""Central Bank Training"" contract and of the related tripartite Protocol mark a crucial step in the co-operation between our institutions, which I very much welcome. This brings me to the TACIS project funded by the European Union for the training of around 400 experts of the Central Bank of Russia over 24 months. Our project will concentrate mainly on the areas of banking supervision and regulation, inspection and licensing, as well as bank rehabilitation. There are two main points that I would like to emphasise: first, the Eurosystem's approach to the TACIS project and, second, the focus on the important issue of banking supervision. First, the Eurosystem – which comprises the ECB and the euro area national central banks – is fully committed to the TACIS project. The project, which will start on 1 November, will be implemented jointly by the ECB and nine national central banks (NCBs) of the euro area (the central banks of Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) on the basis of what we call a ""Eurosystem approach"". By ""Eurosystem approach"", we mean the following. The project will be co-ordinated by an ECB team consisting of Mr. Boris Kisselevsky, who will be the project co-ordinator in Moscow, and Mr. Michael Olsen, senior financial supervision expert, and an Administrative Assistant in Frankfurt. The NCBs as well as the non-central bank supervisory authorities of the United Kingdom, Finland and Sweden will provide the experts for the planned courses and seminars, most of which will take place in Moscow at the CBR premises. Study visits of CBR experts to EU countries will also be organised. A number of representatives of the participating NCBs are present in Moscow today to mark their institutions' strong commitment to the project. The second point I would like to mention pertains to the importance we as central bankers attach to banking supervision. As stressed by Ambassador Wright, the involvement of the Eurosystem in the TACIS project stems from the long-standing experience many NCBs have in the field of banking supervision. It is this vast experience that we wish to share with our Russian counterparts. Sound practices and effective supervision provide a key basis for financial stability and an important platform for the conduct of monetary policy. We have noted with great interest the significant progress made in Russia over the past few years in reforming banking supervision. With this project, the Eurosystem hopes to contribute to further strengthening the CBR's banking supervision function as a key measure to foster a more stable financial environment. Let me conclude on the hope that the Eurosystem's involvement in the TACIS project will act as a catalyst for deepening the working relations between our institutions further. "
2003-10-02,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank today met for the eighth time outside Frankfurt. I would like to thank both Governor Constâncio for his invitation and generous hospitality, as well as the staff of the Banco de Portugal for an excellently organised meeting. Turning to business, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The basic components of our economic and monetary analysis remain in place. In particular, the medium-term outlook for price stability continues to be favourable, allowing us to conclude that the historically low level of ECB interest rates remains appropriate. This also lends ongoing support to economic activity. We will continue to carefully monitor all developments which might affect our assessment. The more detailed considerations underlying our decision are as follows: Starting with the economic analysis, real GDP growth in the euro area was virtually stagnant in the first half of this year. However, the latest data and information are consistent with a moderate pick-up in activity in the second half. In particular, there are signs that economic activity might have firmed somewhat in the third quarter, and confidence indicators available up to September generally point to some improvement in economic expectations. In line with available forecasts and projections, this upturn should gradually strengthen in the course of 2004. Externally, the recovery in world economic activity appears to be proceeding. This should support demand for euro area exports, counteracting the effects of the deterioration in price competitiveness. Domestically, companies seem to be continuing their adjustment efforts to enhance productivity and profitability. This, together with the low level of interest rates, should contribute to a recovery in investment. Furthermore, terms-of-trade effects stemming from the past appreciation of the euro should positively affect real disposable income in the euro area, and thereby private consumption. Developments in financial markets are generally consistent with this overall picture. The short-term risks to our main scenario of a gradual recovery appear to be broadly balanced. However, some risks to the sustainability of economic growth at the global level remain. These are related to the medium-term sustainability of public finances in major industrialised countries and, in this connection, the adjustment of external imbalances in some regions of the world. Turning to the outlook for prices, according to Eurostat's latest flash estimate, HICP inflation in September was 2.1%. This was unchanged from August. For the remainder of this year, HICP inflation should hover at around 2%. Exchange rate developments help to contain short-term upward pressure on prices, while higher unprocessed food prices related to the hot and dry weather conditions in some euro area countries could imply some limited upward risk over the next few months. For early 2004, there is still some uncertainty about the precise impact on HICP inflation of planned increases in indirect taxes and administered prices in a number of euro area countries. Looking beyond the short term, however, we continue to expect inflation to fall below 2% in 2004 and to remain in line with price stability thereafter. This expectation is based on the assumption of moderate wage developments in the context of a gradual economic recovery. In this respect, we note that inflation expectations in the euro area are anchored at levels below but close to 2% over the medium to long term. Turning to the monetary analysis, the strong monetary growth over the past two years has been fuelled by past portfolio shifts, precautionary saving and the low level of interest rates. The latter factor also provided a counterweight to the negative impact of weak economic growth on loan developments. In fact, there are signs of a pick-up in the growth rates of loans to the private sector. At the current juncture, the accumulation of excess liquidity is not a cause for concern given the subdued economic growth in the euro area. However, if it were to persist in conjunction with a significant strengthening of economic activity, it could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term. Summing up and cross-checking the information from the two pillars, our economic analysis continues to confirm the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued in the coming years, in the context of a gradual economic recovery and moderate import price and wage developments. In view of the economic situation, the strong monetary expansion should not be seen as adversely affecting this outlook for the time being. Overall, therefore, the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favourable. As regards fiscal policy, we would like to reiterate our serious concerns. There is growing evidence that most countries will miss their budgetary targets for 2003 by a significant margin and, in a number of cases, budgetary plans for 2004 are not reassuring. While the deterioration of budgetary balances mainly reflects the lower-than-anticipated economic growth, it is worrying to see that not all countries with severe imbalances have so far introduced sufficient consolidation measures. It is fundamental that the credibility of the institutional underpinnings of EMU be maintained. In this respect, let me stress that the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact provide an appropriate framework for maintaining fiscal discipline within adequate bounds of flexibility. Far from being a mechanical scheme to constrain fiscal policies, the excessive deficit procedure establishes a sequence of incentives for countries to prevent and correct severe budgetary imbalances. At each instance of this sequence, a country's fiscal efforts and changes in the economic environment are assessed and taken into account in the design of further steps. Countries are therefore continuously made aware of the risks and costs arising from any delay in taking policy action to preserve the sustainability of public finances. To maintain the credibility of the fiscal policy framework it is essential to fully abide by its rules and to implement them in every respect. Doing so and complying with the requirements of the ECOFIN Council will lead to positive confidence and growth effects, which can be strengthened if fiscal plans are part of a comprehensive and credible medium-term strategy with emphasis on structural expenditure reform. Finally, although it might mean stating the obvious here in Lisbon, the Lisbon Strategy, which was agreed upon back in March 2000, is of the utmost importance in the process of implementing structural reforms. More reforms are urgently needed to reduce structural rigidities in labour and goods markets so as to address the main economic problem of the euro area, namely the high level of structural unemployment. At the same time, current efforts to set in motion important changes in pension and health systems and in other areas in order to prepare for the ageing of society are of immense significance in ensuring the sustainability of our social security systems. Let me close with a few personal remarks. As you are aware, this will most probably be the last press conference following a meeting of the Governing Council that I will chair. From my perspective, these press conferences have been a success. Their purpose is to inform the media and the general public in detail, and on an almost ""real-time"" basis, about the outcome of Governing Council meetings. They have allowed us to communicate and clarify our policy decisions in an open and transparent manner. Indeed, in my view, this practice makes the ECB one of the most transparent central banks in the world. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the media for their work over the five-and-a-half years in which I have had the privilege of being at the helm of the Governing Council. I wish you all the best. We are now at your disposal for questions. Well, you will not be surprised to hear that I am not going to say much about that subject. First of all, I am not and was not surprised particularly, if you realise that today's exchange rate is exactly the same as when we started on 1 January 1999, when I started. The role played by the exchange rate in our monetary policy strategy is by now very well known to you, and it does not need to be repeated here. Of course, we do not normally comment on specific levels or movements. Now I insist on emphasising that the thrust of the G7 discussions in Dubai, to which you refer and in which I took part, was not related to the bilateral euro-dollar exchange rate, but rather to the desirability of spreading the adjustment of existing macroeconomic imbalances more widely across the regions of the world. And I am afraid, ladies and gentlemen, that is all I am going to say about exchange rates today. Well, the process is not over yet. Last week the French government introduced a new budget. Next Monday the Eurogroup will meet to have a first discussion on that topic and then the timing, the judgement and the ultimate judgement will take another couple of months so that, according to the normal procedures, by about Christmas we should know more and be determined to do what has to be done. In the meantime, today Mr Solbes got from the Governing Council of the ECB all the support he might need for his further endeavours, he being the guardian of the Stability and Growth Pact. Given the present circumstances, given our present analysis of the medium-term outlook for price developments and in the light of the other things I said, such as we expect inflation to be below but close to 2% over the medium term, you can extend the word ""appropriate"" over a time frame as long as you like. On the Lisbon strategy, it is fair to say that the original target to make, over a period of ten years, the European economy the most dynamic economy in the world, requires a lot of structural reforms to be realised. It is fair to say then that if the parties to that agreement live up to their determination, there still remains more to be done than has been done so far. As far as oil prices are concerned, we noted with some concern that there has been some recent uptick in the oil prices, but this was not such an overriding phenomenon that we should take it into account in coming to our conclusion that, as the Handelsblatt just reiterated, our rates, at least, are appropriate. Well, you heard that we are sticking to our main scenario, which we have reiterated and published over and over again, of a moderate – but underlining the word ""moderate"" – pick-up of growth during the second half of this year, and we see signs of that emerging and continuing further and accelerating further in the course of 2004. Our present expectation is that this will lead to, by the end of or in the second half of next year, a rate of growth for the euro area which then comes, at an annual rate, close to the long-term potential rate of growth of the euro area. Well, I could say even more about where the euro rate is today. It is at about a level where it was as an average over the last 25 years. So, day-to-day movements do not – almost as a matter of principal – influence our decisions. The first question is easy to answer. The Governing Council does not have any particular rate for the exchange rate in mind which it would call appropriate. We do believe that exchange rates in general should, over the medium or long term, reflect the economic fundamentals of the regions concerned. Then for next year, close to but below 2% implies a rate which is close to but below 2%, but higher than 1.3%, I can assure you. The ECB, that is Mr. Papademos and myself, will give our judgement and support to the European Commission for the process that will take another two or three months, as I just told you. And that's all I am going to say at this point about individual countries. We will be very explicit when we are in the appropriate forum, which is the Council of Ministers. I am as confident as I was four weeks ago about the resumption of economic growth, not more, not less. The United States has a big problem of basically twin deficits, a close to 5% current account deficit, a close to 5% fiscal deficit, that you can afford for one year, two years or three years, but at some point there has to be an adjustment. We hope that the bulk of that adjustment will come through a pick-up of growth in the United States, and for the rest it is a problem for them and for us and for the rest of the world. We do hope – that is what I said in my statement earlier – that the burden of adjustment which has to come will be spread more evenly over the entire world than has been the case up until now. ... oh, in particular for my successor you mean? To do as I did. This is basically a question for Governor Constâncio, but a recession as such, in my opinion, never justifies a violation of the 3% limit. Constâncio: May I add something here. Well, I agree that this is the case. A recession by itself is a growth rate of below 0%. But as you know, it is also in the regulations of the Pact that if the recession is over minus 0.75% this can create a presumption that the ECOFIN Council can consider this as a special circumstance. So there is a reference here to a specific value, which is not an automatic guarantee that it will be accepted as a good reason for violating the 3%, but – as is written in the regulations – it creates the possibility. The position of the Portuguese government – and the position that I have also expressed myself publicly several times – is that Portugal should not take advantage of this possibility. And the Portuguese government has indicated that it is preparing the necessary measures to comply with the limit of the 3% deficit. Well, in my statement I combined the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate and its effects with the impact of unprocessed food prices and some other elements. There has been some pick-up in oil prices, which I also addressed. On the whole, our forecast remains consistent with our definition of price stability, that is, close to but below 2%. But we are inclined to think that it will not be as low as the 1.3% mentioned earlier. Well, I answered that already. The euro is one of the indicators we look at. And, as I said, the euro is now at a level corresponding to its average for the last 25 years, so we can weather any storm. As you correctly state, we estimate the long-term growth potential in the euro area to be in a range of 2-2.5%. And I am not going to let myself be led into forecasts as to whether it will be closer to the bottom or the top. We believe it will be in that range. And I cannot say any more than that. Well, that is a risk I would be very happy to take. Well, that is a cause for concern. The more one-off measures there are the more it is necessary – over time – to replace them with structural measures working their way through over many, many years. And that is something which still has to be done in Italy. But also in other countries. And, I am inclined to say that there are some countries which really are in the danger zone, and Italy is one of them. Körber: Last question. One more question from Mr Major? Do you want to correct your article from this morning maybe? I have said that the risks are more or less balanced, both to the up and to the downside. I said so in my Introductory Statement. But then referring to the first remark that Mr. Koerber made about your article of this morning about a statement that you claim was made by Mr Issing, I want to emphasise that Mr Issing was either misquoted or misread. On no occasion has he made the statement he is purported to have made when giving an analysis in Zürich yesterday. And Mr Issing himself asked me to say precisely this if I had the opportunity to do so. "
2003-09-17,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, designers and representatives of the banknote printing works, members of the jury, On 30 August 2001, more than two years ago, I had the honour, together with the President of the European Central Bank (ECB), of unveiling the final design of the euro banknotes and giving details of the security features. Today, I am very pleased to welcome you to the ECB for the opening of the euro banknote design exhibition. We are displaying here for the first time the 44 entries from the competition, under the themes: the ""Ages and styles of Europe"" and an ""abstract or modern design"". At the end of this press conference, you will be among the first to have the opportunity to embark on a journey back to 1996 and enjoy these designs. The exhibition will remain at the ECB for two weeks before going on show to the general public from 8 October 2003 to 10 January 2004 at the Deutsche Bundesbank's Geldmuseum. It will then tour several other central banks in Europe. I am happy to announce that thanks to the European Commission, you will also have the opportunity in a moment to look at the various design proposals submitted for the European side of the euro coins, which were provided by the authorities involved in the national selection process. These constitute part of the European Commission's euro coins genesis exhibition, which was held earlier this year in Brussels, and which will also tour with our banknote design exhibition. The euro banknotes are used by more than 300 million European citizens in our 12 countries and elsewhere. In the not too distant future, they will also be used in more European countries, as we welcome new members into the euro area. Their contrasting colours, different formats and prominent value numerals make them easy to handle. And it is not us at the ECB who say so, but you and me, as daily users! The smoothness of the euro cash changeover and the high acceptance of the European citizens for their new banknotes and coins in early 2002 already gave us a clear indication of the public's judgement. A survey we conducted shortly after the cash changeover revealed that about two-thirds of interviewees found the euro banknotes attractive. And another survey, conducted by the European Commission in November last year, showed that more than 90% of the interviewed cash users felt that the euro banknotes were easy to distinguish and handle. In this respect, the euro banknotes clearly benefited from the co-operation with the European Blind Union. Until now the ECB has only given information about the winning design. Since we had to enable 300 million people to become familiar with their new money in a relatively short period of time, we intentionally delayed the publication of the other euro banknote design proposals. I think the surveys I have just mentioned indicate that we made the right decision. But the design of the euro banknotes, which today looks so familiar to all of us, has a longer history. It was one of the 44 design series submitted to the EMI in the design competition opened from 12 February to 13 September 1996. Each of the 29 designers or design teams which took part in the competition suggested a different interpretation of a European banknote, based either on the theme, the ""Ages and styles of Europe"", for which 27 proposals were received, or an ""abstract or modern design"", which inspired 17 proposals. Creativity had to cope with the limitations imposed by the need to cater for the inclusion of various security features, both visible and machine-readable. Furthermore, the designs had to ensure gender equality and avoid national bias. Within this framework, the draft designs depicted a variety of motifs, ranging from abstract patterns to portraits of children, from static buildings to dynamic motion, and from animals to human beings. I do not want to elaborate much more on this since, in a few moments, you will be able to judge the variety of themes and inspirations for yourselves. As with any piece of art, all designs are inspiring, although all of us may have very personal views about their attractiveness. Selecting the most suitable design for the future euro banknotes was not an easy task. Before the EMI Council selected the winning design, it appointed a jury of renowned experts in the fields of design, communication and art history, to analyse and rank the designs along criteria, such as their functionality, foreseeable acceptability and the special needs of visually impaired users. Public opinion was then gauged on the ten designs shortlisted by the jury, five for each theme. In parallel, the banknote experts of the EMI and the EU national central banks assessed the ""printability"" and resistance to counterfeiting of the ten pre-selected designs. It was on the basis of all these elements that the EMI Council selected the winning design on 3 December 1996. The winning design was then shown to the European Council in Dublin on 13 December 1996 and presented to the world the same day at simultaneous press conferences held in Dublin by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the EMI, and in Frankfurt by Willem F. Duisenberg, who was appointed his successor, on that same day. Following the selection of the design series submitted by Robert Kalina, some further work had to be done to transform the designs into high-precision banknotes for large-scale production. This implied very close co-operation between Robert Kalina and our banknote experts, and later on between the ECB and both the European Union NCBs and the 15 printing works involved. The timely completion of the production of the more than 15 billion banknotes needed for the euro cash changeover proved that this co-operation had been successful. Today, more than a year and a half after the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins, time has come to tell the whole story of the birth of the euro banknotes and show to you and the citizens of Europe the other designs that could have become our new money. Before inviting you to visit the exhibition, we stand ready to answer your questions. I would just like to add that I am very pleased that most designers and members of the jury could be with us today. They will also be very happy to answer your questions when visiting the exhibition. I wish you a very enjoyable visit. "
2003-09-04,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Today the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Following our regular economic and monetary analysis, we concluded that the current level of ECB interest rates remains appropriate, as the medium-term outlook for price stability continues to be favourable. The historically low interest rates are lending support to economic activity. The Governing Council will carefully monitor all factors that might affect this assessment. I will now explain the considerations underlying our decision in more detail. Starting with the economic analysis, recent data confirm that real economic activity in the euro area was very weak in the second quarter of 2003, with the Eurostat flash estimate suggesting zero quarterly real GDP growth. However, survey data – which indicate that confidence is growing – as well as recent financial market developments are in line with our main scenario of a gradual upturn in economic activity. In line with available forecasts and projections, we continue to expect this upturn to start in the second half of the year and then to strengthen further in the course of 2004. The factors supporting the expected pick-up in activity are both external and domestic. As regards external factors, recent data signal that a recovery is already underway in several parts of the world. This should lead to an increase in euro area export demand, counteracting the effects of the loss of price competitiveness. On the domestic side, ongoing adjustment efforts by companies to enhance competitiveness and profitability should improve the conditions for an economic upswing. In this environment, the low level of interest rates is strengthening incentives to invest. Furthermore, real disposable income in the euro area should be positively affected by terms-of-trade effects stemming from the past appreciation of the euro. Downside risks to this main scenario for economic growth have declined over the past couple of months but have not disappeared. Macroeconomic imbalances in some regions of the world persist. Although these may not affect the short-term economic dynamics, they constitute risks over the longer run. In addition, high oil price levels may continue to have adverse effects on economic activity in the euro area. As regards price developments, Eurostat's flash estimate for annual HICP inflation in August was 2.1%. While recent oil price developments imply some short-term upward pressure on inflation rates, the broad picture of annual HICP inflation hovering around 2% during the remainder of this year remains unchanged. In 2004 annual inflation rates should fall below 2%, stabilising at levels consistent with price stability. This expectation is based on the assumption of moderate wage developments in the context of a gradual economic recovery. Moreover, the significant past strengthening of the external value of the euro should continue to have lagged effects which will limit upward pressure on prices, despite some recent corrections in the level of the euro exchange rate. Over longer time horizons, inflation expectations in the euro area seem to be well anchored at levels below but close to 2%. Turning to the monetary analysis, monetary growth remained strong in recent months and there is significantly more liquidity available in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. In part, this is due to past portfolio shifts and possibly to an increase in monetary holdings related to precautionary motives. Moreover, the low level of interest rates has contributed to the high demand for liquid assets. The current level of interest rates is also counterbalancing the negative impact of subdued economic growth on credit demand. In fact, the growth of loans to the private sector has remained relatively robust since the beginning of the year. At the current juncture, the ample liquidity is not expected to translate into inflationary pressure. However, monetary growth needs to be closely monitored as the significant amounts of excess liquidity could become a source of concern if they were to persist when economic activity strengthens significantly. Summing up and cross-checking the information from the two pillars, our economic analysis confirms the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued in the coming years, in the context of a gradual economic recovery and moderate import price and wage developments. The strong monetary expansion should, in view of the economic situation, not be seen as adversely affecting this outlook for the time being. Overall, therefore, the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favourable. The Governing Council took note with great concern of recent fiscal developments. In order to maintain the credibility of the institutional and economic underpinnings of EMU, it is fundamental to abide in all respects by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. As concerns the upcoming budget plans for 2004, a correction of excessive deficits within the agreed time frame is essential, with an annual structural consolidation effort of at least 0.5% of GDP for countries with fiscal imbalances. Fiscal plans need to be part of a comprehensive and credible medium-term strategy with emphasis on expenditure restraint and growth-oriented restructuring. Sound fiscal policies will help to boost investor and consumer confidence and enhance the prospects for stronger economic growth in the euro area. Progress in implementing structural reforms is as important as fiscal prudence. Efforts to bring public pension systems onto a sustainable path and to further develop private pension schemes deserve support. At the same time, more reforms are needed to reduce structural rigidities in labour and goods markets. Such reforms are essential for addressing what is perceived to be the main economic problem of the euro area, namely the high level of structural unemployment. I am now at your disposal for questions. Papademos: Let me first say that in assessing the available information, and in the context of the economic analysis, we had at our disposal new ECB staff projections. These projections did take into account recent developments in all relevant variables, including the exchange rate. Now, as you know, we do not in the interim publish the results of these projections, but I can confirm that the expected inflation, both for the rest of this year, as well as in 2004 and 2005, is not fundamentally, is not essentially, affected by changes that have taken place in the exchange rate or in oil prices. And indeed, as I mentioned in the introductory statement, inflation is expected to be below 2% and in line with our objective of price stability. Papademos: I am not sure that I understand exactly what kind of discord you are referring to between the ECB and the markets, but if you want to clarify this further, I can be more precise in answering. Papademos: Well, markets form their expectations on the basis of all the information available to them, including their own assessment about the likely stance of policies. I can repeat what I said earlier about our current assessment that the level of interest rates is appropriate, given the available information that we have and on the basis of the analysis we have carried out. And I do not believe it is wise to make unconditional statements about the future. Papademos: Monetary policy decisions, as I believe you very well know, are taken on the basis of a mandate and in order to attain the clearly stated objectives of monetary policy. In doing that, we take into account all information related not only to economic, financial and monetary developments, but also the policies, fiscal policies, that are being pursued. But there is no scope for any ex ante co-ordination, if I may call it that, of policies. We take interest rate decisions so as to achieve our objectives. Papademos: Well, regarding the first part of the question, I think the answer I gave a moment ago is quite relevant, that fiscal developments and prospects – by influencing various economic variables such as demand, prices and possibly interest rates – are taken into account when formulating our decisions. As to the second part of your question, I think the introductory statement was very clear on that, but let me elaborate a bit on this. I think at present the fiscal problems faced by some countries in an environment of subdued economic growth have led some people to the conclusion that a relaxation of the rules of the Pact or a more flexible interpretation of the rules of the Pact would address short-term fiscal problems and the weakness of the economy. Now, we believe that these short-term considerations should not overshadow a number of other important facts and conclusions which are widely supported by evidence. And I think the first important conclusion is that sound public finances and sustainable public finances are conducive not only to price stability but also to long-term growth. Second, that fiscal consolidation strategies have often been accompanied by higher, rather than lower, growth. And third, and more directly related to your question, is that the extent to which an expansionary fiscal policy can influence, can have positive effects on growth, depends a lot on the overall fiscal position of a country, as well as on the extent to which it can strengthen consumer and investor confidence. Having said all this, having stated these conclusions, which I believe are strongly supported by the empirical evidence and experience, I think that we can add that in our view it will be conducive to growth to implement fiscal policies in the medium and long-term perspective and not in a way that may impair the credibility of the fiscal framework of EMU. To put it simply: the governments have certain tasks that they have to carry out. Papademos: Yes. Of course the improvement in growth in the rest of the world, particularly in the United States, is an important external factor which underpins our projected recovery in the second part of this year, in 2004 and beyond. It follows that if the projected increase in growth is less than presently envisaged, there will be some negative effect on euro area economic activity. But at the same time I would like to point out that there are also domestic factors which in our view are underpinning the economic recovery. First, investment, which is expected to recover after a period of weakness, and at the same time consumption, as I noted earlier, positively influenced by terms of trade effects but also, in the coming years, by the projected further decline in inflation, which should boost disposable income. So our projection of an expected recovery depends on both external and domestic factors, but at the same time, as I acknowledged earlier, there are downside risks and some of the downside risks are related to the strength and the pace of the global recovery. Particularly in the United States and especially the recovery of economic growth in the United States. Papademos: It is an important factor, which adds to the uncertainty that exists and, depending on developments, it could either boost or undermine confidence, which is an important element in supporting the pick-up in economic activity that we are projecting at present. Papademos: Let me start with growth. I can say that for the year 2003, and taking into account developments during the first half of 2003, growth is expected to be somewhat below the middle range of the projections we published in June. However, for 2004 and 2005, the rate of growth expected now is virtually unchanged from the range projected in June. So, developments this year are influenced primarily by what has happened in the past. But there are, as I noted earlier, a number of encouraging signs and some data supporting the view that economic activity is picking up. And, looking forward, although we can conclude that growth in the present year will be, as I mentioned earlier, somewhat below that previously envisaged, it does not change essentially the projected growth for the coming years. And I believe that this is broadly in line with the forecasts and projections of other institutions and the private sector. Now, as far as inflation is concerned, the picture also stays essentially the same. Until the end of the year we expect inflation to hover close to or possibly slightly above 2%, in 2004 and 2005 to fall below 2%. And the differences between earlier and recent projections – we take into account not only the change in oil prices you mentioned but also other relevant factors that influence the future evolution of prices – are only slight. Papademos: I think, as I mentioned in the beginning, I should repeat that. The projection implies that inflation will be below, but not far below, 2%. And as I said earlier, that is slightly different from our previous projection, slightly different but in the upward direction and by not much. Papademos: On your first question regarding the effects of the interest rates on money demand: the situation, really, has not changed in any fundamental way because the demand for broad money depends on the whole spectrum of interest rates. Short-term interest rates have remained unchanged. And the increase in long-term yields – which by the way is a very recent one – does not seem to have had any visible effects. The responses of investors and portfolio shifts are not immediate. They take some time. We could expect some reversal in the future, at least a partial reversal, of the portfolio shifts observed in the past from assets outside M3 into assets that are included in M3. On your question about Mr. Solbes: he attended today. And, well, I think he is very much in line with our views, and I would turn it around to say that the ECB has been supporting the position of the Commission, namely that it is essential for the credibility of EMU – I would say not only the institutional, as we said in the note, but also the economic underpinnings of EMU – that the Stability Pact is respected and the fiscal plans that have been adopted and announced by Member States with excessive deficits are implemented as initially envisaged. Papademos: Well, in principle, the strengthening of infrastructure in the Union is, I would say, a generally desirable objective. And if done appropriately and financed appropriately, it could help to boost economic growth. However, the final assessment depends very much on how it is financed and on this I do not have, at present, detailed information in order to be able to give you a precise judgement. But it is crucial, of course, that the implementation of such plans does not impinge on and does not adversely affect the public finances of countries that are already facing serious fiscal constraints. So the short answer is: it depends. Papademos: About rate cuts in the future, you mean? The answer is: no. And the answer to the question of whether there was any discussion about rate cuts in the coming months: every month, as you know, we assess all the information we have on the basis of the economic and monetary analysis, consistent with the monetary policy strategy. And the decisions that have been taken, that are taken every month, are based on such an analysis. And, as we meet every month, we reassess carefully and comprehensively the situation. Now, in the future, for the future, one can make – and I am now talking in general – hypotheses on the basis of assumptions. And these can lead to additional conclusions. So, alternative scenarios can be contemplated on the basis of alternative assumptions concerning the evolution of economic and monetary variables. But such an analysis does not lead to any conclusions for decisions at present. I would point to two statements in the Introductory Statement which suggest that, compared with two months ago – so looking more to the past than to the future – the risks to output growth are judged at present to be diminished but not to have disappeared. And there are, at the same time, positive upside risks – particularly associated with positive economic developments and prospects globally. So, on the basis of all these developments, but also taking into account developments in other variables, such as the price of oil – which is an important consideration – the decisions will be made in the future. Papademos: I believe I should not make any comment that could be interpreted in any way as influencing decisions. So I will make a general remark, which I believe to be appropriate and neutral. On the one hand, from the point of view of the ECB and the Eurosystem, we would be delighted if Sweden were to join the euro area. On the other hand, and this is the important part, this is a decision for the Swedish people to take. And whatever the outcome of this referendum, the ECB and the ESCB will continue their close co-operation with the central bank of Sweden, within the framework of the ESCB. Papademos: I think you could infer this from what I said. I said, more precisely, that the outcome will depend on the modalities of the financing and whether it will impinge on public finances in countries that are at present facing fiscal problems. And if it does, it will obviously increase the pressures and the problems associated with the excessive deficits that have been recorded in these countries and will make it more difficult to implement budgetary policies and so to bring the fiscal position in these countries closer to balance over the medium term, which – as we stressed in the Statement and as I stressed separately earlier – we believe is going to contribute to rather than adversely affect economic growth. "
2003-07-10,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council, Mr. Tremonti. Following our regular economic and monetary analysis, we have concluded that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate in view of the favourable outlook for price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Interest rates in the euro area are low by historical standards, both in nominal and real terms, thus lending support to economic activity and helping to safeguard against downside risks to economic growth. The Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors that might affect this assessment. Allow me to explain our assessment in detail. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data and information continue to suggest that economic growth in the euro area remained subdued in the second quarter of the year, after virtually stagnating in the first quarter. The indicators available broadly point to a stabilisation of activity but there are no signs as yet of an underlying strengthening in production and confidence. At the same time, financial market developments seem to reflect a somewhat more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook both inside and outside the euro area. On the whole, we continue to expect a gradual strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. This should be supported by lower inflation and thus higher real disposable income, the low level of interest rates, and a recovery in external demand for euro area goods and services. This assessment is in line with all available forecasts and projections. Nevertheless, downside risks to this main scenario are still relevant. While concerns over the SARS virus have faded, there are risks relating in particular to the accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances outside the euro area and to the extent of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector to enhance productivity and profitability. Turning to price developments, the outlook over the medium term remains favourable. For the remainder of this year, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to fluctuate around the current level of 2%, the rate recently estimated by Eurostat for June. In early 2004 a significant base effect related to energy prices should lead to a marked fall in annual HICP inflation rates, assuming broadly unchanged oil prices and exchange rates. Subsequently, the exchange rate pass-through and a moderate economic recovery should contain price pressures. In this respect, wage developments in particular are expected to remain consistent with a favourable outlook for price stability. Other price indicators, such as developments in producer prices, tend to support this picture. Moreover, all available forecasts and projections as well as indicators of inflation expectations point in the same direction, namely that price stability in line with our aim of inflation below but close to 2% will be maintained over the medium term. In the context of our monetary analysis, substantial excess liquidity has accumulated in the euro area as a consequence of the extended period of high M3 growth. This strong growth has continued in recent months, as economic uncertainty and the low level of interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum have increased the attractiveness of holding liquid assets. At the same time, the low level of interest rates has helped support recent growth in loans to the private sector. While the large amount of excess liquidity should be less of a concern in a period of moderate economic activity, monetary developments need to be closely monitored in terms of their implications for price stability over the medium to long term. To sum up, our economic analysis confirms the expectation that price dynamics will remain moderate in the euro area in the context of a gradual economic recovery and the strengthened euro exchange rate. The monetary analysis indicates that the strong expansion of M3 should, for the time being, not be seen as adversely affecting this outlook. Hence, cross-checking the information from the two pillars leads to the conclusion that the outlook for price stability over the medium term remains favourable. With medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, and with interest rates at historical lows, monetary policy has made a significant contribution to improving the conditions for a recovery in economic growth. However, other policy-makers also have to assume their responsibilities. Part of the weakness in economic growth in the euro area can be linked to a lack of ambition in the areas of fiscal and structural reform to further improve the conditions for investment and employment. A strong commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact and adherence to well designed medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies in those countries currently struggling with increasing fiscal imbalances would make a major contribution to improving confidence. In a similar way, progress in structural reforms in the labour and product markets would not only increase the euro area's growth potential and enhance its ability to better withstand external shocks, but it would also eliminate a great deal of the uncertainty currently clouding long-term planning and prospects. In the current situation, characterised by subdued economic growth and low confidence, structural reform and a steady and reliable course of fiscal policy, in line with the European fiscal framework, are of the highest priority. We are now at your disposal for questions. I cannot tell you in substance. Mr. Tremonti gave us an outline of the plans of the Italian presidency for the second half of this year, focusing on their by now already widely known initiative to enhance structural public investment, but financed mainly by private means, helped by the European Investment Bank. ... we listened. You could say that. That is one of the major macroeconomic imbalances which persists. But not only in the United States, also in Japan. Basically, you might also include the imbalances that exist in the world on account of the fact that the large and fast growing economies in Asia broadly speaking have an exchange rate policy which links their currency to the US dollar, despite the fact that their economic developments are sometimes very different from those in the United States. Yes, I thought I said it again. That is still the scenario. But very gradual. And then accelerating slightly in the course of next year, but it remains gradual. No, I am prepared to say that the current monetary policy stance is – given the circumstances and given the outlook – appropriate. And that is what I also said in my Introductory Statement. Well, I gave a plea for a responsible policy of fiscal consolidation and then I do not comment on individual countries' announcements. But I do think that in both countries it is not only tax cuts which are on the agenda but also measures on the expenditure side. But a judgement about that will come in the context of our discussions in the Eurogroup, in which we participate. And that is the time and the forum for speaking about that. Not here today. We do not think so, because the yields have been rising and the differential between US long-term yields and European long-term yields has diminished somewhat in that process. But they are rising from levels which can still be called – and which I do call – historically extremely low. Well, yes, the market is always right, as you know. And it is purely market-driven. So, therefore, it is justified. No, I very much welcome it, if it is indeed the first sign that confidence may be returning. We can only read that in the financial markets and not yet that much in the surveys on consumer and industrial confidence. Although also there, there are first signs – but they are not yet very robust – that we may have reached the low point in confidence and may even already have passed it. The answer to the first question is: I expect to remain in office until my duly appointed successor can take up office. That is the formula I have used before, as you know. As to your second question on the strategy, I would like to point out that the evaluation of the strategy was carried out by the entire Governing Council and was confirmed by the Governing Council, including, in all likelihood, my potential successor. If I refer to the most recent surveys of consumer and industrial confidence, they have at least stopped falling and there are first, albeit very preliminary, signs that we may have reached the bottom and that confidence may be returning, at last. This I will tell you but, taking into account that the judgement was delivered this morning at 9.30 a.m. and that it is 41 pages long, the ECB is not in a position to provide you already today with a detailed assessment of this judgement and its implications for the ECB. This will be done in the coming days and we will deliver a press release in due course. But I would like to make a few first comments. First, it has to be understood that there was never a dispute between the Commission and the ECB on the need to combat fraud and other illegal activities within the Community institutions and bodies and the ECB. Together with the institutions of the European Communities and the Member States, we attach great importance to the protection of the Communities' as well as the ECB's financial interests and to efforts to combat fraud and other illegal activities that might be detrimental to the Communities' as well as to the ECB's financial interests. Now it was in this spirit that the ECB established, by means of its Decision of 7 October 1999, a comprehensive anti-fraud scheme under an independent committee, aimed at the prevention of fraud and other illegal activities detrimental to the financial interests of the ECB. And that ECB Decision, at the time, closely mirrored the regime which had been set up by the European Regulation concerning investigations conducted by the European anti-fraud office, OLAF. And it provided for co-operation between the ECB's anti-fraud committee and OLAF. Therefore, the dispute – which we have now lost – between the Commission and the ECB was about a legal matter and was therefore a more technical question. The question was namely: does the regime, as set up by the European Regulation of 1999, apply to the ECB, or does that regime apply only to the European institutions and bodies that depend on the budget of the Community? As you know, the ECB does not depend on the budget of the Community. Can the ECB establish its own anti-fraud regime in order to better protect its financial interests? Financial interests, which are different and separate from those of the Community institutions. We, at the time, answered that question by saying ""yes, we can"". The court has now decided ""no, you cannot"". Now, it follows from today's judgement of the European Court of Justice that the ECB is indeed covered by the regime set up by that European Regulation of 1999, and the protection of its financial interests has to be provided under that European regime and not separately and in parallel. Now, the ECB, like the institutions and the bodies of the Community, is not prevented from establishing an internal system aimed at fighting fraud, but this can only supplement or complement, but not replace the regime of the European Regulation of 1999. So as a consequence of this ruling, the ECB will have to adapt its Decision accordingly, and it will do so in the furtherance of its objective, which is shared by the Commission and the ECB alike: to combat fraud and other illegal activities within the Community institutions and bodies and within the ECB. I think this answers your question completely and it is really too early to take any more questions on this very recent development. Let me answer that question immediately. We did not discuss it in substance. In fact, the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels, COREPER, decided the day before yesterday that the ECB will be asked to deliver an opinion on the draft constitution and it will be asked to deliver that opinion in good time before the start of the Intergovernmental Conference. Effectively this means that we will deliver that opinion before 1 October, towards the end of September. We have established what we call a ""High-Level Task Force"" to prepare that opinion for the Governing Council and we hope to adopt the opinion in our second meeting in September. So that is just procedure, but in substance we did not discuss it. We leave that for the time being to the High-Level Task Force. We of course have written, I have written, two letters to the presidency of the Convention, to Monsieur Giscard d'Estaing. These letters have in part been followed in redrafting the Convention, but largely they have not. And so undoubtedly we will in our opinion come back to those main features. The letters can be found on the ECB's website. No. Because rate-setting by commercial banks does not fall under the competence of the central bank. I did not use the word ""appropriate"" at the last press conference. I did use it in my testimony to the European Parliament, as you know, and we deliberately included it in today's Introductory Statement. That shows how confident we are that we are on the right track with our monetary policy stance. I can make no forecast about how long we will remain on that track, but I would expect us to be on it for a considerable time to come. We still stick to our main scenario. We still think that it is the valid picture, as published in the June Monthly Bulletin, and we have no reason to deviate from it. We are of the firm opinion that such risks do not exist in the euro area. Well, this may be a good opportunity to say exactly what I said when we met the trade union representatives. I simply explained what the procedure is. The procedure is (and the dates are fixed) that on 15 July, I believe, the Ministers of Finance will formulate the proposal for the presidency of the ECB. Then the Governing Council of the ECB and the European Parliament have to deliver an opinion on that proposal. I think that the Governing Council will do that during the first meeting after the proposal has been received. That means specifically in our meeting of 31 July. The European Parliament has set the date for a hearing of the candidate on 11 September. I might add that deviously they have also set a date for my regular hearing on 10 September. And then, when the Committee of the European Parliament has held its hearing, the opinion of the European Parliament will be adopted in the plenary session – and I know this by heart – on 25 September. After that, the proposal and the two opinions will be handed over to the European Council in the composition of Heads of State or Government and they will make the ultimate decision expected to be taken on 15 October when the European Council meets in Brussels. The date of 1 November derives from that because the decision of 15 October will have to contain a date mentioning when the decision becomes effective. The first feasible date after that decision of mid-October is – and this is simply bureaucracy, you might say – not the day after, but two weeks later on 1 November. Personally I would have preferred a different date, but that is not very relevant. Last month, I gave a purely technical answer, an answer to the question: is there still room for lowering interest rates further? And the technical answer was: as long as interest rates are not zero, there must be room. So, I can repeat that answer, but you already know it. I spent it wisely... No, I will not comment on the Bank of England's decision. I do not comment on measures taken by other monetary institutions. I was aware of it, that such a decision was coming. And the developments of the exchange rate did not enter into our considerations today. Considerations, or a decision, which were not really contested. But I must confess that we saw with some relief that the strong appreciation which had been evident in the months before seems, at least for the time being, to have been interrupted. Let me put it that way. I do not see that risk at all. I do not believe that I will, and I do not intend to be a lame duck. Have a nice summer break and see you all on 4 September 2003. "
2003-06-05,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Following a comprehensive economic and monetary analysis, we have concluded that the outlook for price stability over the medium term has improved significantly since our last decision to lower interest rates in March. As a result, we have decided to reduce our key interest rates by 50 basis points. This decision is in line with our monetary policy strategy, including the aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2% over the medium term. At the same time, this interest rate reduction takes into account the downside risks to economic growth. The Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors which are relevant to its assessment. Let me explain our assessment in detail. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data releases on real GDP growth have confirmed that economic activity in the euro area remained subdued in the first quarter of this year. This outcome also reflects the negative impact of the Iraq crisis on both the global economy and the euro area. However, the survey evidence for April and May does not suggest an immediate improvement after the resolution of this conflict and is at best mixed. Accordingly, economic growth in the first half of 2003 is likely to be very weak, and expectations for annual average economic growth for this year and for 2004 have had to be scaled down. Nevertheless, we still expect a gradual strengthening of real GDP growth in the course of 2003, which should gather more pace next year. All available forecasts as well as recent financial market reactions seem to reflect a similar assessment. The main factors supporting this outlook are both external and domestic in nature. On the external side, the expected upturn in extra-euro area demand should compensate for the dampening effect of the appreciation of the euro. Evidently, the significant and rapid appreciation of the euro over recent months will dampen external price competitiveness. However, the current level of the euro's real effective exchange rate, and thereby the competitive position of euro area exporters, is very close to longer-term averages. Thus, when put into perspective, current euro exchange rate levels are in line with economic fundamentals and with our interest in a strong and stable euro. On the domestic side, private consumption growth should recover further from the second half of 2003 onwards. This would reflect the growth in real disposable income supported by positive terms of trade effects and lower inflation rates. Moreover, there are no significant imbalances in the household sector as a whole that would hinder such a recovery. At the same time, the contribution of investment to growth is likely to remain more modest, although an improvement in the global economic environment and the historically low level of interest rates should contribute to an upswing. The Governing Council is conscious of the continuing downside risks to economic growth. Notably, risks stem from the past accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances outside the euro area, and there are ongoing concerns with regard to the SARS virus. In addition, some uncertainty remains as to the extent of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector to enhance productivity and profitability. This could also have an impact on employment growth and thus private consumption. Given this environment, the outlook for price developments has become more favourable. Following Eurostat's flash estimate of the inflation rate for May of 1.9%, annual inflation rates are expected to hover broadly around this level for the remainder of this year and to fall significantly in 2004. This assessment is based on the assumption of favourable import prices, reflecting both generally stable oil price developments and the higher exchange rate, as well as lower domestic price pressure in the context of a moderate economic recovery. In particular, wage growth is expected to remain broadly stable. Coupled with productivity gains, this should therefore result in a moderation of unit labour costs. In the context of our monetary analysis, we saw persistent strong growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3. Consequently, the euro area economy has continued to accumulate liquidity significantly above the amount needed to sustain non-inflationary growth. There are, however, several considerations which counterbalance concerns that this ample liquidity will lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. In particular, monetary developments continue to be fostered by portfolio shifts, reflecting a sustained preference on the part of investors for liquid and secure assets. This is confirmed by evidence from both the components and counterparts of M3. Indeed, loans to the private sector increased at a much more moderate pace than M3. Moreover, higher monetary growth was accompanied by a much lower net acquisition of foreign equity by non-MFI euro area residents, also implying portfolio reallocations away from riskier assets. Consequently, the portfolio shifts that have affected M3 growth over the past two years should unwind over time. Finally, the perspective that economic activity will remain moderate reduces the likelihood of excess liquidity giving rise to increased spending. Nevertheless, one has to bear in mind that monetary growth is also supported by the low level of interest rates. Therefore, monetary developments need to be closely monitored with respect to their implications for price stability over the medium to long term. Summing up our economic analysis, it currently appears that inflation rates should decline to below 2% over the medium term, following recent movements in the exchange rate of the euro and given the sluggish growth performance of the euro area. Our monetary analysis indicates that the strong expansion of M3 should not for the time being adversely affect this outlook. Hence, cross-checking the information from the two pillars leads us to conclude that the outlook for price stability over the medium term has become more favourable. Let me at this point comment on the debate about the hypothetical risk of deflation. As far as the euro area is concerned, it should be recalled that inflation has been hovering around 2% for quite some time and that there are currently no forecasts indicating any deflationary risks. The ECB's monetary policy aims at inflation of below but close to 2% over the medium term. In this respect, inflation expectations should remain well anchored at this level, irrespective of shorter-term developments in prices. At the regional level, a period of relatively low price increases or even price level declines will improve a region's competitiveness within the currency area. Within a monetary union, deflation is not a meaningful concept when applied to individual regions. At this juncture, it may be particularly warranted to stress that monetary policy cannot by itself generate lasting and sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. This can only be achieved by appropriate structural measures that address fundamental weaknesses and tackle urgent adjustment requirements. In this respect, fiscal policies have a great potential for fostering confidence and thereby supporting activity, even in the short run. Establishing a well designed medium-term consolidation strategy in those countries currently struggling with increasing fiscal imbalances would make a major contribution in this direction. This would imply comprehensive and growth-friendly measures including, in particular, a courageous reform of the structure and level of public expenditure. Curbing spending growth would eventually also create further room for manoeuvre to address future pressure arising from pension systems and scope for future tax cuts. Procedurally, it is crucial to underpin the fiscal policy framework with a decisive and consistent implementation of the rules of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact, and rigorous monitoring and peer pressure amongst Member States. By the same measure, bold structural reforms in the labour and product markets would not only increase the euro area's growth potential and enhance its ability to better withstand external shocks, but it would also eliminate a great deal of the uncertainty currently overshadowing long-term planning and perspectives. This, in turn, would also have positive effects over the shorter term. In particular, renewed momentum in the process of structural reform would foster consumer and investor confidence and thereby greatly facilitate spending and investment decisions in the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions. On the first question, I can say ""yes"". The new projections were available and will be made public in next week's Monthly Bulletin. We are not inclined to give individual figures for some orders of magnitude or variants when you cannot see them in the broader context of the all-encompassing projections as they will be in public. But it is true what I said: the outlook for inflation has improved significantly, and the outlook for economic growth is one of a very sluggish performance this year and a moderate recovery in the course of next year. With regard to whether we have had to scale down both figures, I would not say that we have done so to a large, but to a significant extent. As you know, we will publish our projections next week and we publish them in the form of a certain range. So, I would not give you point figures, anyway, like you have just done now. On your first question, if you read my statement of four weeks ago, of 8 May 2003, very carefully, you will see that I said that we have to monitor developments further and that we had to be sure of what we already saw at that time, namely that prices would develop in a favourable way. We are sure of that now. So, last time, we were not as sure yet. But then, on the other hand, as you may well recall, I did push the door halfway open for a decision to be made at a later stage. And the direction was very clear, as was clearly picked up by the markets. So, the markets have – to a large extent – already discounted the move we made today, whereas they would have been very surprised if it had been done last time. No, that is not the right interpretation. That it does not say that they are appropriate is not unusual. But, if you ask your usual question ""is there a bias?"" then the answer is ""no"". Interest rates are lower here than in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Was I surprised or was I encouraged? No, we take our decisions on the basis of an analysis for the euro area only, and in the interests of price stability in the euro area. That is what we now have achieved, price stability, and that is what we will continue to achieve in the period ahead. And, in judging the economic performance of the euro area vis-à-vis other countries such as Sweden or the United Kingdom, one should never forget that these economies are going through entirely different economic circumstances. I am referring, for example to the huge shock that has been dealt to the euro area economy as a whole by the re-unification of Germany, which – after all – makes up more than one-third of the euro area economy. And that, to a great extent, explains the differences in the performance of the economy. Another factor that should not be forgotten is that the structural reforms we have constantly been pleading for in the euro area, in all euro area countries, have in fact already been applied in both the United Kingdom and Sweden ten years earlier. And that, in itself, has nothing to do with being ""in"" or ""out"" of the currency union. ... of a high level. You did not hear me say that. And when you ask it, I cannot answer that. It is the same answer that I just gave to Mr. Sims. We will continue to monitor developments closely. And then, I do not have to remind you that we said – with some emphasis – that we have now reached levels of interest rates that we have never seen in any Member State of the euro area before. They are historically very low, indeed. Which war are you talking about? That is not the field of my competence. Well, as I said in my introduction, certainly the end of the war – or the actual military activity in Iraq – has, to a great extent, removed the uncertainties that prevailed at the time, but as yet not totally. Its effect still has to work its way through and reinstate, so to speak, the confidence of the people – and that is crucial. The confidence of the people would be enhanced if governments delivered what they promised to deliver. There was not much discussion about the size of the rate cut, I can assure you. There was a quick and general consensus on the fact that the rate cut was necessary and about its size. Moreover, we had been talking to each other for a long time already. Room for manoeuvre? Well, if the United States has room for manoeuvre with an even lower interest rate level than we have, then you can imagine we have not exhausted our room for manoeuvre. I beg you to believe me that I have no idea how long I will be here. So those considerations have not entered my mind, nor that of any other member of the Governing Council. Not really ""discussed"" – it was mentioned. All kinds of figures were mentioned, but as I said, there was a very broad if not overall agreement on the decision that we reached today. To no extent, and that is the short answer I can give you. I even saw ministers pleading for an interest rate cut after we had already taken the decision. I do not have a message for the UK. It is up to the UK to decide when and why. The ""why"" is clear to me, the ""when"" I do not know. Because it would be advantageous for the development of the United Kingdom and for the euro area if we joined forces again. I cannot quantify that, but you will be able to judge for yourself when next week you see our revised projections, or I should say the revised projections by the staff of the ECB and all NCBs. President: No, there is no new role: the role for M3 is the same as it always has been. As you noted in my presentation of the evaluation and clarification of the monetary policy strategy last month, and as you noted in my statement of today, we reversed the order in which we discussed the two pillars. Why did we do that? In the old days –- if I may call them ""old days"" now – we always talked about the first and second pillar, as if there was a ranking. Now we want to emphasise that we use both types of analysis, the broad economic analysis and the narrower monetary analysis, only as a means to better order our discussion and as a means to cross-check the information we receive from both analyses in order to underpin our interest rate decisions. The decision we took today is totally in line with the strategy outlined a month ago. Since, as you know, the strategy has not changed but merely been clarified, this decision would also have been taken had we not made this clarification public. But then, as I did in my Introductory Statement, I paid considerable attention to monetary developments and I extensively explained why we do not consider the very dynamic monetary developments – as we see them – as a threat that inflation might again be on its way up. So you might say I explained that danger away with well-reasoned arguments. President: No. It is true that we have now made the interest rate differential between the dollar and the euro smaller. And that in itself subtracts, one could say, one impulse for the exchange rate movement we have witnessed in the last couple of months. But that is not the only factor. The main factor is that we think that this rate cut is compatible with our aim to preserve price stability over the medium term in a forward-looking way, and that is the main impulse for making this cut. President: I do not answer ""what if?"" questions. President: Monetary policy is expected to be conducted in such a way that it primarily achieves price stability to prevail over the euro area as a whole. And that is what we promised the people that we will deliver. People can see that we do deliver. You might say that we have achieved price stability by now. And we promise to maintain it. I think that we are credible enough for people to believe that we will deliver what we promise to deliver. And now it is the turn of the governments to do the same thing. That is what I said. But it is not true that nothing is happening. That is a little too pessimistic a view, in my mind. Lots of things are happening in almost all countries of the euro area, but admittedly this is too little and often too late in some countries, particularly the larger ones. But then I always add that the aim of the Stability and Growth Pact is for one's budget to be in balance or even with a small surplus over the medium term. What you should not forget is that eight out of the twelve countries have already achieved that aim. And they will not let the other ones loose, even though they are bigger. That, of course, is the statement I made on the basis of unchanged interest rates. ""Significantly below"" is something more than ""close to"" 2%. So you can draw your own conclusions. That question I have already answered, I believe. I have no expectations. I have no bias. I am simply saying ""We will monitor the situation and act"". If you want to hear the word ""appropriately"", then when the time is ripe. I cannot comment on individual countries. But I am not agreeing with that figure, if that is what you want to hear. We are slightly less pessimistic apparently than the IMF. I was already very clear when I said that I was almost astonished at what the IMF has done, that is, publish a staff paper on inflation differentials and deflation in the euro area. I have never seen the IMF publish a paper on inflation differentials between California and New Hampshire or between Texas and Ohio. Whereas there we are talking about one currency area which is even much smaller than the euro area. And so, that there are inflation differentials is nothing more than normal. There always will be between the various regions of a currency area. But if I may quote myself, I said, ""within a monetary union"" – which the euro area is and which the United States is – ""deflation is not a meaningful concept when applied to individual regions"", like New Hampshire or Germany. We are convinced that we don't have to prepare ourselves for deflation because we don't see deflation coming. And that's what I have said, I think, loud and clear. Then, is the ECB prepared to deal with the ""if"" situation if it were to come? The answer is ""yes"". Many of us have experience with periods of deflation and we know what to do in that case. I'm not talking about the 30s. I'm talking about the 90s. I was ... In the Netherlands I had two consecutive years of deflation... Well, we are always quoted as being an example for the rest of the world. So, ... ... no, I did not say that another figure than the 50 basis points was advocated. I said, of course, we discuss other figures, both higher and lower. But no-one advocated a figure that was different from the one of the decision we took today. I can assure you of that. There is nothing linked to the notion of deflation. It is only linked to, what in itself is, a very favourable outlook for price developments. It's so favourable that we can afford to lower interest rates without endangering our projection and goal of price stability, which is close to but below 2%. "
2003-05-08,Duisenberg,"Slides: pdf 36 kB. Issing: Certainly not. We have confirmed our two-pillar approach. This is totally different from what is normally seen as inflation targeting. And second, this ""close to 2%"" is not a change, it is a clarification of what we have done so far, what we have achieved – namely inflation expectations remaining in a narrow range of between roughly 1.7% and 1.9% – and what we intend to do in our forward-looking monetary policy. Issing: I think that what has certainly not changed, and what was always in our minds, is that if we were to identify a risk of inflation approaching very low levels on a sustainable basis and threatening to fall below 1% in a persistent way, then we should of course be extremely concerned. With our clarification now, that we aim to keep inflation at close to 2%, I think it is clear enough that we are not blind in the eye which identifies deflationary problems. We have both eyes – as Paul Samuelson said in a slightly different context – watching deflationary as well as inflationary developments. Second question: do you still need the distinction of two pillars or will the first pillar in the future be your economic analysis and the second pillar your monetary analysis? In other words, could we actually skip the term ""pillars""? And the next question is: if I have understood you correctly, it seems to me that you are going to be less transparent about what you are analysing in your monetary analysis as you are no longer going to publish the reference value. What do you share with the public under your former first pillar? Issing: I am glad to contribute to your article. First, we did not say that we will no longer publish a reference value. But we will discontinue the practice we have adopted so far, namely that of the Governing Council reviewing the reference value in December each year. What is behind that? It is mainly that there was a misconception that the yearly review would lead to a yearly reference value indicator, a kind of normative indicator for the development of money. This was never intended. It was a ""timeless"" concept right from the beginning. A yearly review in this context has perhaps led to some confusion. So what we will do is not skip the reference value; we are keeping it. But this will be monitored and if there are changes, for example in the trend of potential growth – hopefully in the upward direction – in the euro area, which is badly needed, then this will have consequences for the reference value. But this might or might not happen. And when the time comes, then we will do it in a more technical way and not in this preannounced procedure that gave rise to expectations which were never intended from our side. On the two-pillar structure, I am a bit surprised by your question because this is the core element of today's confirmation. What we do in the changed format of the introductory statement, and perhaps you could again see this as I think it reads much better now, is that we start with more short-term developments in the economic analysis part and then move finally to monetary analysis with a focus on medium to long-term elements, before organising the cross-checking. This remains exactly the two-pillar approach which is specific to the European Central Bank, which gives weight to monetary and to economic analysis, avoiding the impression that all the assessment comes from one single approach. The final assessment is indeed a single one, but the approach is based on two pillars. And I think we make this process very transparent. This still gives money a very prominent role in the assessment of risks to price stability. Sometimes critics argue that we should combine both assessments into one single assessment or one pillar, or whatever you might want to call it. I think that anybody who can solve this problem of integrating money into the usual models deserves the Nobel Prize. So far there has been no approach which, in a satisfactory, comprehensive way, combines monetary and the usual economic forecasting analysis. And so, we are keeping this two-pillar structure unchanged. But I think we have clarified our communication. Finally, ""close to 2%"" clarifies what we have done so far, what we have had in mind so far and what we will try to continue to achieve, and if the next four-and-a-half years are marked, as were the past four-and-a-half years, by inflation expectations of below 2%, in a range of 1.7% to 1.9%, I think that this would be a result that perhaps nobody would have expected before the euro was introduced. No. That I cannot say for the future, but for now the answer is no. Issing: I think that it was appropriate for the past, otherwise we would have changed it. But for the future, I do not know. What we have discovered is that this annual review apparently causes misunderstanding and confusion. We should not specify any horizon within which the reference value should be reviewed. Changes in the trend velocity of money and in potential growth are dependent on factors which are not, so to speak, connected to the calendar year. Second question – I do not know if you have actually said this before – do you plan to conduct further strategy reviews of the whole strategy, not just M3, in future? Will this become a regular thing? Issing: I do not know if this procedure will become regular. My term runs for another three years and I do not expect another evaluation within that period. We are somewhat exhausted and need some recreation now. These studies which support the final decision by the Governing Council cannot be done every day and it would not make sense to do so. We have looked at and assessed so many aspects, for example ranges, point targets and focal points. You will find all that information in the background papers and I don't think it makes sense to repeat the process within a very short horizon. On the reference value, I do not know. We will, of course, assess potential growth in the euro area and will continue to study stability of money demand. In this context, one of the results in both cases will be that we have new estimates on potential growth and on trend velocity. If these developments indicate a major, sustainable change, then we will have to consider reviewing the reference value. When this will happen, I do not know. Issing: First, it was no trouble. It was not always pleasurable, but it was fascinating and, for somebody with my background, it was a very challenging aspect of my work, and co-operation with our experts is always very enjoyable. The word ""trouble"" is certainly not appropriate in this context. But as the President has already said, even if we had had the same clarification back in 1998, our policy would not have been any different. So I do not expect – and there is no reason to expect – a different monetary policy on the basis of the clarification of the strategy, which was decided on today. Issing: If you are married and after four years of a happy married life, perhaps one evening you sit together over a glass of wine and think about why you are so happy all the time: nobody would say it does not make sense. [Laughter] But, to be a bit more serious, there was a lot of criticism and we do not ignore criticism. We only ignore unsubstantiated criticism. There were many aspects raised by many papers with interesting questions and we had to study, for example, ranges: are they more successful in guiding inflation expectations? The outcome was ""no"". If you compare our policy results with those of other central banks, we cannot complain – this was an important result – but we do not just rely on our conviction that we are the best. We want to see our results confirmed by studies. And you have to study stability of money demand. It is not a question or law of nature. It depends on developments in financial markets, etc. So, all the background discussions conducted were useful and necessary and, from time to time, I think it is necessary for any institution to ask itself, ""are we on the right track?"" This does not mean that you start from a point of uncertainty: you simply want to be more certain that you are on the right track and this, of course, can only be done at large intervals. Let me repeat that we wanted to improve communication. A central bank has to have confidence and credibility. You only get that when you are being understood by the public and by the markets. In order to be understood, you have to explain. So, to a very large extent, this is indeed a method. It is an effort on our part to be better understood than we were in the past. Issing: We stated that we are satisfied with the outcome of an inflation rate of below but close to 2%. At the same time, this means that we have an adequate safety margin to alleviate any concerns about falling into the trap of deflation; or about dealing with measurement bias. This is all included now. So I think again, we have clarified what we always had in mind. Perhaps we have previously not communicated it successfully enough. Papademos: If I can elaborate a bit on this issue. I think it is useful to focus on the role of the monetary policy strategy. It serves two purposes, it has two roles: first, to help decision-making and, second, to facilitate communicating this decision. Today's clarification helps to this end. In the past there has been some uncertainty and some criticism about the exact aim of monetary policy within the quantitative definition of price stability adopted. We have confirmed the definition of price stability. At the same time we have clarified that, within that definition, the aim of our policy will be inflation close to 2% from below. Ex post, one could say that the policies pursued over the last four years have shown that this was indeed the strategy pursued. Now this is clarified and this should help us to communicate our monetary policy decisions. So I think this is the essence. Papademos: No, there was no such decision. The last point is basically the same as the question that was asked earlier: are you not behind the curve in coming late with decisions. As Professor Issing has explained, we do not explicitly have an activist, short-term-oriented policy. We do not want that. So we will not reach decisions quicker or slower, if decisions are warranted at all. As far as the first part of your question is concerned, I would like to assure you that the discussions we had did not, of course, immediately lead to a unified view. But the decision taken and confirmed today was made with a strong consensus view in the Governing Council. That does not mean that there were no differing views. There were, but they were also going in different directions. For example, on the formula of the definition itself: maintaining price stability is defined as a rate of inflation of below 2%. There were those who pleaded for an even tighter interpretation. There were others who pleaded for a looser interpretation. In the end we all agreed that we would have a big credibility problem and would even create our own credibility problem if we were to change the definition. And so we quickly reached consensus that there was no need, and that it would even be dangerous, to change the definition. It would have been remarkable if, in a discussion involving 18 participants, we had all had our noses pointing in the same direction from the outset. Issing: I dispel it. Issing: The concept of deflation is not question of sectors and countries, it is a question of the monetary area. In all large monetary areas in the world, you have regions with low and even sometimes negative developments in prices, and others with higher price developments. This is not specific to the euro area, but it has nothing to do with deflation. Deflation is a concept related to monetary policy for the average of the whole monetary area. Sectoral price developments are a question of relative prices and it is quite normal that, for example, in the computer sector or telecommunications, you have extreme price declines: it is part of everyday life. It is a question of relative prices of a market economy. This is totally different from the concept of deflation and, as the Vice-President has already indicated, and as I have tried to explain, we did not have a corridor before and we do not have a corridor now. In the 16 years that I was the Governor of the central bank of the Netherlands, there were two years in which we had deflation of ½%. I publicly declared then that I lived in a central banker's paradise; as long as the others have more inflation, it is not a problem. "
2003-05-08,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The first news I can report is that today we successfully concluded our discussions of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. However, I would ask you to postpone any questions you may have on this subject to a little later this afternoon. A press release will be issued on this matter and Mr. Issing will join us for a special press briefing in the form of a seminar on the outcome of our discussions. This seminar will take place in this room immediately after the press conference. You will also note that, as a consequence of the conclusions we reached, I have restructured today's introductory statement somewhat, and I will be following this new structure in the future. The introductory statement will henceforth present first economic analysis, followed by monetary analysis. It concludes by cross-checking the analyses conducted under these two pillars. Turning now to our discussion of monetary policy, we have decided to keep our key interest rates unchanged. Taking due account of new economic and monetary information as well as the latest geopolitical developments, we concluded that the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the preservation of price stability over the medium term. At the same time it maintains a monetary environment that is conducive to economic growth. With the end of the military action in Iraq, important downside risks to the economic recovery have diminished, and our focus is now again on the other forces that have been shaping the economic outlook. The Governing Council will carefully monitor future developments and assess whether conditions for price stability continue to develop favourably. Let me explain our assessment in detail. In the context of our economic analysis, focusing on the short to medium term, recently published survey data and the latest information from conjunctural indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area has remained subdued so far this year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect a gradual strengthening of real GDP growth to start later in 2003 and to gather more pace in the course of next year. Factors supporting this outlook are an expected recovery of global demand, the prospect of falling inflation benefiting real disposable income growth, and the low level of interest rates. Moreover, the recent unwinding of uncertainties associated with geopolitical tensions should contribute to an economic recovery. Such an assessment also seems to be reflected in recent financial market reactions. Since the end of the war in Iraq, financial market volatility has declined significantly, with a notable increase in stock prices. Nevertheless, there continue to be downside risks. First, there are the risks originating from the past accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances outside the euro area, and lately concerns have arisen with regard to the SARS virus. Moreover, there is also some uncertainty over the extent of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector in order to enhance productivity and profitability, which could have an impact on employment growth and thus private consumption. As regards price developments, the annual rate of HICP inflation generally fluctuated at around 2.3-2.4% between the autumn of last year and March 2003. Broadly speaking, declining inflation rates in services and non-energy industrial goods have been offset by rising rates in energy and processed food prices. Conversely, in April energy prices are expected to reflect the decline in oil prices following the developments in Iraq. This expectation is in line with Eurostat's flash estimate for the inflation rate in April, which was 2.1%, i.e. 0.3 percentage point lower than in March. Looking ahead, current indications do not point to further strong declines in the inflation rate in the immediate future, but lower oil prices, an environment of moderate economic growth and, of course, the effects of the significantly higher exchange rate of the euro should all contribute to reducing inflationary pressure beyond the short term. The outlook for inflation will also depend to a significant extent on wage developments. The available indicators suggest that labour cost growth has shown signs of stabilising in the course of 2002. Moderate wage trends are indeed crucial both to maintain price stability and to foster employment growth. In the context of our monetary analysis, focusing on the medium to long term, the broad monetary aggregate M3 has now been growing strongly over a protracted period. Moreover, the data for more recent months do not suggest that a process of correction has started. As a consequence, the euro area economy continued to accumulate liquidity significantly above the amount needed to sustain non-inflationary growth The strong monetary expansion contrasted with the more moderate growth in loans to the private sector. This is consistent with our assessment that monetary developments continue to be fostered by portfolio shifts, reflecting a sustained preference on the part of investors for liquid and secure assets in an environment of high uncertainty. However, the low level of interest rates has also contributed to strong monetary growth. When interpreting monetary trends, particular account needs to be taken of the portfolio shifts towards increased demand for monetary assets for precautionary reasons. The reduction in geopolitical tensions should support an unwinding of these portfolio shifts. A reversal in monetary trends would in any case dampen the concerns regarding the medium to long-term implications of recent monetary dynamics. As a consequence, monetary developments will continue to be monitored closely. Overall, it currently appears that inflation rates should decline to below 2% over the medium term, in particular given the outlook for economic activity and the significant appreciation of the euro. It also appears that the strong expansion of M3 should not adversely affect this outlook, as portfolio shifts have played a prominent role; in particular, the build up of liquidity should not translate into inflationary pressure as long as economic growth remains modest. Hence, cross-checking the information from the two pillars leads us to conclude that the risks to price stability over the medium term remain limited. Regarding fiscal policy, developments in 2002 were generally not satisfactory. In particular, countries that had not achieved sound fiscal positions in earlier years when the economic conditions were more favourable are now struggling to keep their budgets under control. Looking ahead, it is crucial to underpin the fiscal policy framework with decisive action, strong peer pressure and consistent implementation of the rules of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact. Countries should maintain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus over the cycle, and, where this is not yet the case, take the required structural consolidation measures. This also creates the necessary room for the operation of automatic stabilisers. At the same time, governments are advised to place the emphasis on growth-oriented consolidation policies that strengthen the productive forces of the economy. By strengthening confidence, a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy will also support economic growth in the short term. Finally, structural reforms are essential to increase the euro area's growth potential and enhance its ability to better withstand external shocks. Indeed, such reforms, which should aim to reduce rigidities in labour and goods markets, could significantly strengthen the degree of resilience of economic activity to such shocks, both in the euro area as a whole and in its regions. Renewed momentum in the process of structural reform will be important to foster consumer and investor confidence in medium and long-term growth and employment opportunities in the euro area. This, in turn, should also have a positive short-term effect on spending and investment decisions in the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions. Whereas earlier this year we expected inflation to fall to below the upper limit of 2%, we now, due to the recent increase in oil prices, and in food prices, expect that not to happen before around the end of this year. And we also expect inflation as from then – everything else remaining unchanged, of course – to remain at around that level for some time to come. But that is looking really far ahead. On food prices: are they significant? Yes, they are significant. They are part and parcel of household spending. But I cannot assign greater significance to food prices than to all other factors that influence the consumer price index. The twin deficit has emerged, I might say, and we do hope that the inevitable adjustment which has to take place, and which will take place over time, will occur in an orderly and gradual manner. Well, as always, it was discussed extensively, the monetary policy stance as such. And the reasons for not changing rates were manifold today. We need more information, we need more information on whether recent developments – in particular, I am also thinking about the exchange rate here – will continue or peter out. Or will they even reverse? We do not know yet. We have to have more information – we have to know more. We do have one bit of new information – which we basically knew already – namely that it will take inflation longer than originally expected to fall below the threshold of 2%. All the reasons indicated, I might say, to still wait a while. We have, of course, considered risks. We always consider risks, but there is no risk of inaction. I would like to point out that deciding to keep interest rates unchanged is also an action. Well, I do not know whether we are that long behind the curve. I believe that this underestimation of growth prospects is – I am almost inclined to say – a worldwide phenomenon. It is not only happening here. So, that is not the cause of particular concern. Well, twice in my introductory statement I talked about the significant appreciation of the euro. One can say that the euro – at the moment – is about at the level which, as we also said in Greece, better reflects the fundamentals and it is roughly at average historical levels. So, there is not yet anything excessive about the level. The speed at which it is strengthening is almost equal to the speed at which it declined two years ago. And that is a matter which we will closely watch in the near and more distant future. We also read our newspapers and we see that here and there the word ""deflation"" is re-emerging. We do not share this fear for the euro area as a whole. But may I refer the remainder of your questions to the second part of this press conference. First of all, I protest against the word ""target"". We do not have a target, as you know and – as Mr. Issing will explain later – we won't have a target. Well, let me leave it at that. We did discuss it in today's meeting. But we have not drawn any conclusions. You have to remember that neither the ECB nor the Eurosystem is a member of the Convention. So, what information we get we get in an informal way and sometimes we respond in an informal way. And, on the whole, let me say we were not shocked by the draft Constitution. Well, that varies from participant to participant in the discussion. First of all, I would dispel or do away with the argument that there would be a rift between the Board members and the other members of the Governing Council. Then, the discussion has not been concluded yet. In Article 14 of the draft Constitution it is mentioned that from then on, when the Constitution becomes law, the ECB would be regarded as a so-called European Union Institution, which it is not now. We are still studying that and we agreed that we will come back on that issue at a later stage. After all, you have to remember that once the outcome of the Convention, the draft for the new Constitution, has become the subject of the Intergovernmental Conference then the ECB will be asked for an advice or an opinion, or is entitled to give an advice or an opinion. At this stage, we are not at all involved. On Article 21, we have a slight preference – the whole Governing Council has a slight preference – to drastically shorten and make more precise the wording of Article 21, where it describes the tasks and functions and mandate of the ESCB and the ECB, implicitly therefore also all the Eurosystem. That can be phrased, we believe, much more elegantly and concisely, whereas our main concern – that of the entire Governing Council – is that the Convention's proposal should in no way change anything in the mandate, in the independence, in the legal position, in the power to issue regulations of the Eurosystem, the ECB, and the ESCB. And we will make these views known to the Praesidium of the Convention. It is no different. That is still about the figure we have. But as you know, we are in the process of undertaking a new forecasting exercise. Those projections will be concluded and published in June. I cannot already say now what the outcome will be. I said the same as I said last time: that they are consistent with the present economic stance and economic situation. I would not qualify it as that. I would advise you, once you have it, very carefully to read again what I said in my statement. I will leave it to you then to interpret it and to draw your own conclusions. I do not have those figures in mind. I simply do not know them. But I would like to repeat that, at the moment, the international price competitiveness of euro area exporters – when measured on the basis of real effective exchange rates – is near the historical averages. And this is a development which we have always expected, and which we welcome. We have no indication of that building up. But then, as Mr. Greenspan used to say, it is very difficult to predict a bubble. "
2003-04-03,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank today met for the seventh time outside Frankfurt. Let me therefore thank both Governor Fazio for his invitation and generous hospitality, and the staff of the Banca d'Italia for an excellently organised meeting. At our meeting today, which took place in the exceptional circumstances associated with the conflict in Iraq, we comprehensively reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments. We discussed at some length the potential economic implications of the military operations. In the Governing Council's view, it is not possible at this juncture to assess what effect they will have on the global economy, and on economic developments and the medium-term outlook for price stability in the euro area. Overall, the basic elements of our assessment of 6 March on the outlook for price stability remain in place and accordingly we decided to keep interest rates unchanged. We also noted that the outbreak of the war has not affected the functioning of the financial system. As indicated in our press release of 20 March, the Governing Council will act to ensure the proper functioning of financial markets, providing sufficient liquidity in the euro area as needed. Let me now explain our assessment of economic developments in more detail. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rate of M3 was 7.4% in the period from December 2002 to February 2003, up from 7.0% in the period from November 2002 to January 2003. Given the continued high volatility in financial markets, mainly related to the geopolitical uncertainty, M3 growth continued to be fostered by portfolio shifts away from more risky assets. However, M3 growth appears also to have been affected by the low level of short-term interest rates prevailing in the euro area, as indicated by the strong growth in its most liquid components. At the same time, credit growth showed signs of stabilisation in early 2003, after the moderation observed throughout last year. Turning to the analysis under the second pillar, recent data and surveys continue to confirm that real GDP growth in the euro area remained weak in early 2003. In particular, the persistence of geopolitical tensions continued to negatively affect sentiment and dampen economic activity, thereby adding to the forces which had already depressed the outlook for the euro area before the escalation of tensions in the Middle East. As a result, we should only expect a modest rate of economic growth for 2003. However, the evolution of economic growth for the rest of this year is particularly difficult to foresee at the moment, given the exceptional degree of uncertainty arising from the military conflict. Our baseline scenario continues to be one of a moderate recovery associated with diminishing uncertainty, starting in the second half of 2003. However, we will need to review the economic implications of the war as soon as a clearer picture emerges. A number of scenarios, implying widely different outcomes for economic activity, are conceivable at present. Yet it would be premature to assign specific probabilities to any such exercises, which are mainly of an illustrative nature. Looking at price developments, annual HICP inflation is estimated by Eurostat to have been 2.4% in March 2003, unchanged from February. The recent drop in oil prices is not likely to be reflected in the price statistics until April. As for the outlook for price stability over the medium term, it is particularly important to clearly distinguish between short-term volatility and more fundamental factors. While oil price developments may very much influence the pattern of inflation rates over the coming months, other factors should dominate beyond the short term. The lagged effects of the appreciation of the euro exchange rate since mid-2002 will continue to dampen upward pressure on prices, as will the modest economic growth. If the recent significant reduction in oil prices is sustained, inflation rates will in all likelihood fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and remain in line with price stability thereafter; evidently, this presupposes that wage moderation prevails. Overall, the present policy stance is consistent with the preservation of price stability over the medium term. It maintains a monetary environment that is in itself favourable to economic growth in a situation in which other factors are having an adverse effect on economic activity. Exceptional circumstances are complicating the assessment of economic trends. We will therefore continue to monitor events carefully and evaluate them in the light of our mandate. Regarding fiscal policies, the Stability and Growth Pact provides a robust and flexible framework for addressing any strains on public finances without undermining the principle of budgetary discipline. While letting, where possible, automatic stabilisers operate in reaction to changing economic circumstances, there is no reason to pursue fiscal activism. It remains essential that both the commitments made in the stability programmes and the requests to further improve fiscal positions, as subsequently agreed in the ECOFIN Council, are implemented in full. This will help to build confidence in the fiscal framework and anchor expectations about the future macroeconomic environment. In a highly uncertain environment, it is all the more essential that governments help to boost investor and consumer confidence by taking decisive action to implement structural reforms in labour and product markets and in public finance. On the one hand, there appears to be a broad consensus among policymakers and the public that such reforms are important to ultimately raise the euro area's production potential, improve the flexibility of the economy and make the euro area more resilient to external shocks. On the other hand, notwithstanding some progress in individual countries, the effective pace of reform has so far remained slow and clearly insufficient to meet the Lisbon objectives. Over the past few years this has given rise to an implementation gap. Efforts to overcome structural inefficiencies in the functioning of markets must be stepped up. This would promote confidence in the medium-term production capacity of the euro area and therefore counteract to some extent the current high degree of uncertainty. We are now at your disposal for questions. I am afraid I cannot discuss the evaluation of the strategy, which is under way at the moment. Our experts are actively discussing and evaluating the strategy and are preparing the Governing Council for a thorough discussion. The first discussion will take place in the context of the next Governing Council meeting, and we will have another discussion about two weeks later. Maybe that will be final, maybe we will need another discussion two weeks later – we are rather flexible on that – but I can assure you that I will be in a position to answer all your questions, possibly before the end of May. We had, of course, a substantial discussion, as we always have during the first meeting in the month of the Governing Council, on the monetary policy stance, but without a bias in any direction. And our conclusion was clear: we decided not to change interest rates today. As far as the second part of your question is concerned, as I indicated in my introduction already: uncertainty about future developments is so large that we have various scenarios about what will happen once the uncertainty diminishes. But we do not know when that will happen, and the ""when"" is very determinant for the kind of scenario you are discussing. So it would be pure speculation to go into further detail about the various scenarios which might develop, without knowing which one has the greatest possibility of being realised. We have not been surprised by the development of the data. What maybe surprises us is the higher degree of volatility that we observe in the markets, both in the foreign exchange markets and in the markets for financial assets. That is ... well, if not a surprise, then at least a phenomenon that we closely observe. By setting a firm framework for the future monetary policy stance, we hope to contribute to diminishing this volatility to the best of our abilities. Now, as regards the second part of the question, our baseline scenario is still, as you indicated – and as I indicated at our previous press conference – for a modest, if not very modest, rate of growth on average over this year and for the resumption of economic recovery in the course of the second half of this year. A change in the monetary policy stance is possible at any moment when our analysis – which is based on a well-defined monetary policy strategy, as you all know – leads us to decide on such a change - war or no war. And I cannot quantify the degree of significance we attach respectively to core inflation, headline inflation or overall inflation, as you call it. We look at all those things simultaneously. They are just one part of our analysis which gives rise to certain policy decisions. Question (Translation): In view of the difficult economic situation internationally, compounded by the war, to what degree could a rate cut affect and improve the situation? If we bear in mind that in Japan interest rates are close to zero, have been close to zero for a long time, and nothing much has changed. Turning to Italy, the changeover has been referred to as a major factor affecting the economy. A proposal has been made to introduce €1 and €2 banknotes. The European Central Bank has been studying the situation; what is your opinion on this? You asked: what could a rate cut do in the current circumstances? I am almost inclined to say: we continuously ask ourselves the same question. So the fact that we concluded today that the current circumstances would not give rise to a change in the monetary policy stance or, in other words, to a change in the level of official interest rates, reflects our opinion that the best contribution we can make to a revival of confidence among consumers and investors and in the markets is to stay calm and to present an image of continuity and stability. We are still studying the issue of the €1 note, which was raised in particular by the Italian Minister of Finance. Our experts are looking at it, and we do not exclude anything. But do not expect any decision before, we have engaged in preparing for the second series of banknotes to be put into circulation. That is a matter which is in preparation but which is years and years and years from now. And we will decide on that particular question when that moment draws near. Neither we nor the ministers have under consideration, as far as I know, any change in the criteria as they are. Now, if you are referring in particular to the cyclical situation in which the euro area finds itself, we see, in the current circumstances, no reason for fiscal activism and no reason to drift away from the policy commitments and the stance for fiscal policy as incorporated in the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. The volatility of the exchange rate has maybe been a little bit more intensive than in the days before the war. Short-term movements are not very significant for the long-term development. The appreciation of the euro since the middle of last year is continuing to have an impact in a dampening of the inflationary pressures. And that has nothing to do with volatility. I am very pleased to hear the sounds from the other side of the ocean, that the prospects there seem to be bright. As far as the euro area is concerned, I can only repeat what I said in my introductory statement: the Governing Council foresees only a modest rate of growth for this year and a moderate start to the recovery in the course of this year. Your first question was ""if I heard you correctly"". Well, I did not use the word ""bias"" in my statement and I will not. What I did say was that the present policy stance is consistent with the preservation of price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor developments at any given time during the coming weeks and months to see whether we come to another conclusion. So, the correct interpretation is: there is no bias. Neither in the direction nor in the amount. I have also read these comments from various international organisations or private institutions such as the IIF. We take note of them with interest, but I have indicated the conclusions to which we come loud and clear in the introductory statement, which was carefully prepared by the Governing Council today. Question (Translation): Mr. President, maybe you could explain something. You refer to modest and moderate growth in the second half of the year, but could you give us a figure? What do you mean by modest or moderate? Well, it is no secret that we think that, on average, growth for a year that has started so sluggishly will not exceed a figure of around 1%. I think that is a sufficient indication. Fazio (Translation): We have not debated this at the Council. I think that is a sufficient answer. Question (Translation): Mr. President, the war might last for a long time. Even after the war is over, it could imply considerable military expenditure or higher spending in order to guarantee security in a number of countries, as well as in Europe. Are you afraid, Mr. President, that this might lead governments to relax their adjustment policies? Because the necessary resources would objectively be lacking. I cannot speculate on what will happen after the war, if and when the war is over. It is certainly true that peace is as hard to win as it is to win a war. And what is of concern to the Governing Council is the re-emergence in the United States of the so-called twin deficit situation, where we now see – and this is a cause of concern – both the current account and the federal government deficit going in the direction of exceeding 5% of GDP. That is a situation which is unsustainable over the longer run. It could make both their and our lives more difficult in the future. Fazio: I would just like to repeat one passage from the introductory statement: ""In a highly uncertain environment, it is all the more essential that governments help to boost investor and consumer confidence by taking decisive action to implement structural reforms."" (Translation) In a highly uncertain environment, due to geopolitical tensions – and this is an understatement – we must rebuild confidence. The current times are characterised by a high degree of uncertainty. Uncertainty leads to cutting expenditure for investment and consumption. The demand for durable goods, capital goods, has been falling. So our philosophy is the following: we must build up confidence, and this applies to both fiscal and monetary policies. At times of uncertainty we must ensure that we stay on the right track. As far as my succession is concerned, I do not take questions on that subject, with the exception of one answer that I can give: in the letter I wrote to President Aznar in February of last year, when he was President of the European Union, I literally wrote ""Dear Mr. President, I herewith ask you to permit me to resign on 9 July 2003, or so much later as is in the interest of a smooth transition of the Presidency."" And I have neither privately, nor publicly, anything to add to that clear statement. On transatlantic co-ordination with the authorities, of course we continuously co-ordinate, or at least discuss, our policies and we inform each other of them and of our policy intentions. But that is an ongoing process and in the current climate there is nothing that would indicate that we need to intensify that. I may want to remind you that when you hear outsiders talk about this, they also talk about it in the light of the upcoming G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, which is to take place on Saturday next week. But there is nothing exceptional in our minds in this respect. Question (Translation): Could you elaborate, Mr. President, on some of the remarks you have made? If I am not mistaken, these modest and moderate growth forecasts are your current projections on the basis of the current situation. My first question is, are those the same forecasts as two weeks ago? This is the first meeting of the Governing Council after the outbreak of the war. Did you have the same analysis today as you did two weeks ago? Are these moderate and modest forecasts current forecasts? Is recession a possible scenario? It may suffice to literally repeat what I said in my introductory statement on behalf of the Governing Council, and I quote: ""Our baseline scenario continues to be one of a moderate recovery associated with diminishing uncertainty, starting in the second half of 2003"". From that you can infer that we have not changed our baseline scenario and that our forecasts are still the same as they were when we talked to each other one month ago. And I may add that the word ""recession"" has not been used in today's Governing Council discussion. That should be enough of an indication. All the signals I have come from your papers. A smooth transition can take anything from one week to one month, to two months, to three months – it is completely uncertain. But as long as the transition is smooth the Governing Council and I will be very, very satisfied. "
2003-03-06,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. We have comprehensively reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments today. We concluded that the outlook for price stability over the medium term has improved in recent months, owing in particular to the subdued pace of economic growth and the appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro. As a result, the Governing Council has decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Let me explain our assessment of recent economic developments in more detail. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.1% in the period from November 2002 to January 2003, compared with 6.9% in the period from October to December 2002. The continued strong monetary growth reflects an ongoing pronounced preference for liquidity in an environment of high financial, economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Although liquidity remains ample, it is not expected at this stage to give rise to inflationary pressures, given the current economic context and the expectation that some of the portfolio shifts will be reversed once the financial market uncertainty diminishes. Recent data on loans to the private sector, notably the weak growth in loans to non-financial corporations in late 2002, confirm this assessment. Turning to the analysis under the second pillar, available data and surveys indicate that economic activity in the euro area remained sluggish in late 2002 and in the first months of 2003. In light of recent developments, the outlook for economic growth in the euro area in 2003 has weakened compared with previous expectations, owing especially to the geopolitical tensions and the associated rise in oil prices. Accordingly, only a very modest rate of economic growth should now be expected this year. Considering price developments, according to Eurostat, annual HICP inflation is estimated to have been 2.3% in February 2003, slightly up from 2.2% in January. The main factor behind this change seems to be the rise in oil prices. In addition, some base effects related to food prices may have contributed to the renewed increase in annual inflation in February. The ongoing volatility in oil markets makes it difficult to forecast short-term inflation developments. However, once some normalisation in these markets has occurred, more fundamental factors should dominate price developments. First, the significant appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro over the past year is expected to continue to feed through the economy into consumer prices, via import and producer prices. Second, the moderate pace of economic growth should also reduce inflationary pressures, influencing price and cost-setting behaviours. If oil prices moderate in the future, as currently expected by markets, the most likely outcome will be that inflation rates will fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and remain clearly at levels in line with price stability thereafter. This baseline scenario relies on the assumption that, especially in an environment of subdued economic growth, wage moderation will prevail. In fact, some recent indications suggest more modest wage developments towards the end of last year, but this picture would need to be confirmed in the future. Overall, ECB key interest rates have reached levels which are very low. On the basis of the currently available information, this policy stance, while contributing to the preservation of price stability over the medium term, provides some counterbalance to the various factors which are currently having an adverse effect on economic activity. Looking ahead, the most likely scenario is that economic growth will gradually recover once the factors contributing to the high economic uncertainty have diminished. While the expected weak economic activity at the beginning of this year will imply low average economic growth in 2003, a rise in quarterly growth rates should materialise in the course of the year. Over time, the euro area economy should benefit from a global economic recovery and the prevailing low levels of interest rates, as well as from falling inflation supporting real disposable income and underpinning private consumption growth. However, any judgement on future developments is overshadowed at present by the geopolitical tensions and their potential resolution. Monetary policy cannot address this kind of uncertainty. Depending on further developments, the Governing Council stands ready to act decisively and in a timely manner. The prospects for the euro area economy will depend very much on measures taken in other policy areas. As for fiscal policy, adherence of all countries to the framework laid down in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact will support stable and sustainable public finances, and will thereby contribute significantly both to confidence and to favourable financing conditions for the private sector. In most cases, the fiscal policy stance implicit in the updated stability programmes strikes a reasonable balance between letting automatic stabilisers operate and seeking further consolidation where needed. In some cases, current consolidation ambitions are weak. In order to further boost confidence in the fiscal framework and the economic environment, it is essential that appropriate consolidation plans are implemented in all countries with remaining imbalances. Hence, the commitments made in the stability programmes and the requests to further improve fiscal positions, as subsequently agreed in the ECOFIN Council, must be implemented in full. In this respect, the measures should be part of a comprehensive and growth-oriented strategy, which for most countries means putting the focus on both restraining the volume, and reforming the structure, of public expenditure. Finally, the outlook for the euro area economy could be significantly improved if governments strengthen their efforts to implement structural reforms in labour and product markets. Such reforms are important to ultimately raise the euro area's production potential, improve the flexibility of the economy, and make the euro area more resilient to external shocks. In particular at the current juncture, when economic activity is subdued, taking measures to make the euro area a more attractive place to invest in can contribute substantially to fostering confidence. We are now at your disposal for questions. The last question I will not answer, as you know. The reason ""why"" is that we thought that this cut by 25 basis points was, in the current uncertain circumstances we live in, the most appropriate. Four weeks ago I said that a drop then would be a drop in a sea of uncertainty and go by unnoticed. In the meantime, we have made a new assessment of the prospects for the euro area, both for output and inflation. So, the uncertainty in our assessment has somewhat diminished but at the same time we thought that one drop would be better than two drops. We are not in a position to precisely ascertain what the future will bring. Especially the geopolitical uncertainties are such and so large that it is simply impossible to make a precise judgement about what monetary policy would do and will do. I said just now that the Governing Council remains alert and stands ready to act decisively and in a timely manner, but the consequences of a war can go in many directions. So can the decisions of the Governing Council. Well, we are conducting the review. And, as I said before, it is an unprejudiced evaluation of the strategy after five years of experience. It is now with our staff and the staff of all national central banks, who are discussing it and studying it. We expect, as a Governing Council, to devote a first discussion to it towards the end of April. Our intention is to have it completed in the course of May. And then you will know more. So, this will be well in time for the conference of ECB watchers. Well, I think I do not need to. Because when I watched the screen carefully at 1.45 p.m., the exchange rate, if that is what you mean by the markets, stood at USD 1.0960; one minute later – after the press release was published – it stood at USD 1.0920, and 30 seconds later it stood at USD 1.0970. So, it rebounded. And when I came into this meeting it stood at USD 1.0965. So I do not share your judgement that there has been a bad reaction so far. In the Governing Council you mean? The Governing Council, again, acted as a collegial decision-making body, and it was not difficult, was it Lucas? Papademos: No. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, a question on today's decision and the strategy: is the impression correct that this is a step-by-step move towards inflation-targeting and that the prominent role of the money supply is now no longer as important as it was or is being merged with inflation? That impression is wrong. And as I said, we are in the process, without any prejudice, of reviewing our monetary policy strategy. And we are doing that in a, may I say, calm and unprejudiced manner. So any conclusion you might want to draw already today is certainly premature. Question (translation): Second question: the ECB's rotation model. The Ministers have until 21 March to have the concept ready. What is your position concerning your rotation proposal for EU enlargement, do you think your proposal will be agreed? That I assume. We have made our proposal. It is now out of our hands and the Ministers of Finance have to make up their mind, which they have already virtually done. The European Commission has made up its mind, the European Parliament has made up its mind, and then it is up to the EU Council to take the final decision. It is out of my hands and out of my sphere of influence. Well as you say, you have never seen one central banker telling the other one what to do. You have now seen an exception. But that will remain the exception. On growth: the main driving force of course has to come from the restoration of confidence, and that relates primarily, for economic growth, to private consumption. People have to become confident of their future for private consumption to become the main driving force for the resumption of economic growth. Next to that, we also expect a global economic recovery and, with that, some help will also come from our export performance. Because we still think that the exchange rate developments have not fundamentally undermined the competitive position of the euro area vis-à-vis the rest of the world. We had new forecasts, we have them four times a year, and actually I had them the evening before I attended the G7 meeting – at which you were present, I believe, and heard me make my statement. That statement was strongly inspired by those new assessments. The forecasts we have available now do not, basically, differ from those which were published by the IMF. But as I said, both the growth figures and the inflation figures had, sorry to say it, to be revised downward and not insignificantly. I would not make suggestions at this table to undermine the competitive position of the banks, so I will make no suggestions in whatever direction. In addition, we have authority over the official interest rates, and it is up to the banks to follow them wholly or partly or whatever they want to do. That is not in our competence. I am realistic enough not be too optimistic. But I have to say what has to be said, time and time again. I could also say, ceterum censeo, carthaginem delendam esse. First of all, it did not play a role in our considerations. And then I – and I should say we – cannot and did not want to speculate on how the events will evolve once a war breaks out. So, we did not take into consideration the various scenarios: whether it will be short and quick, or long and drawn out. But then I would like to point out, once everything is over – after a short or a long period – the geopolitical tensions, as we euphemistically call them, are the overwhelming factor, but not the only one, influencing the confidence of the people. So there are more factors at work. For example, the performance of economic growth, the performance of unemployment, which also – contrary to our earlier expectations – does not yet show clear signs of coming down. On the contrary, in our expectations, there is little likelihood that it will come down in the course of this year, and for next year, we are also very uncertain about it. I will say this much. For this year, the first quarter started very sluggishly and the second quarter does not indicate very many signs of improvement. We expect growth, on average, to be in the order of 1%. It is our impression that the by now rather prolonged threat of war has already undermined confidence to such an extent that it has already had, or at least is having, a dampening effect on consumer demand. Well, if we use the word ""appropriate"" we expect it to remain valid for a considerable period of time. By now the uncertainties are so great and the developments may come so fast. And we are not even certain of what direction the actual development will take. So that is the reason why we deliberately avoided the word ""appropriate"" because that would give a sort of consolidation idea which we simply don't have. Question (translation): Mr. President, is today's decision mainly psychological, one which you took for mainly psychological reasons? Second question: did you and your colleagues make assessments or get assessments as to how the last decision on interest rates was handed on by banks? Because you said that today's decision was also supposed to be slightly in favour of growth. Third question: can you explain why the euro is relatively strong despite the fact that in Europe there is no political progress, no progress as far as the economic cycle is concerned, and in the United States, compared with Europe, there is nothing problematic that one can see either? Might this be due to the fact that the American government and American policy generally would rather like the dollar to be a little bit weaker or not as strong as it used to be? There is certainly an element of psychology in our move. We have tried to analyse to what extent the previous interest rate move on 5 December 2002 has worked its way through into the bank lending rates. The conclusion was that the reaction of the banks can be described as having been normal, similar to other rate reductions which have taken place in the past. And your third question was can I explain the exchange rate. The answer is ""no"", but I can only speak for the euro area. I do believe that the exchange rate development brings the mutual relationship more in line with the fundamentals as they develop and have developed over time between these two great economic areas. So they do better reflect the fundamentals than in the past. And that must certainly also have played a role in the actual movements. ...I also said I was a realist I would not say that nothing has been done. In various countries various things have indeed been done. But I am with you in concluding that by far not enough has been done. That is why we keep urging governments to tackle this problem of structural reform. And if the same governments in Lisbon declared that within ten years the European economy will be the most dynamic economy in the world, then I am inclined to say that they have little time to lose. It had nothing to do with the war, but if you come to an assessment – and we make an assessment every month – if you come to an assessment of the prospects in a forward-looking manner for the euro area economy over a time span of 1.5 to 2 years that is significantly different from the previous assessment, then you should not wait. And I believe the markets did not expect us to wait. I do not know this proposal. Under the Treaty the central banks are forbidden to finance governments, to give credit to governments. When money is seized my reaction would be similar to my reaction if this were forbidden. I recently had talks with both the outgoing Governor and the incoming Governor of the Bank of England and the subject was not mentioned. Papademos: Well, you can see I am still smiling. Do not make any inferences from this fact. I think that our projections are as good as any in the profession. And the implication that I think was derived from this reference to the smile is that there may exist some tensions between Mr. Issing and myself. I would like to say that there are no tensions whatsoever. Occasionally, we do disagree: I think that sometimes he tends to prefer Bordeaux and I prefer Burgundy. This may complicate sometimes the decisions in the Council on which wine to choose for the lunch. But that's it. "
2003-02-06,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. We have reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments and have incorporated new information into our assessment. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate to preserve a favourable outlook for price stability in the medium term. Consequently, we have kept our key interest rates unchanged. Their low level should help counterbalance the negative effects on economic activity that currently stem from the high degree of worldwide uncertainty and should, thereby, contribute to a sustainable economic recovery in the course of 2003. For the time being, we still assume that the high degree of uncertainty will decline in the course of this year. However, at this juncture it is very difficult, if not impossible, to form a conclusive judgement on the impact of geopolitical developments on the world economy in general, and the euro area in particular. Turning to the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 declined to 6.9% in the period from October to December 2002, from 7.1% in the period from September to November 2002. The continued strong monetary growth reflects an ongoing pronounced preference for liquidity in an environment of high financial, economic and geopolitical uncertainty. However, it also mirrors the low level of short-term and long-term interest rates in the euro area. Although liquidity remains ample, it is unlikely at this stage that it will give rise to inflationary pressures, given the current economic environment and the expectation that some of the portfolio shifts will be reversed once the financial market uncertainty diminishes. This assessment is also supported by the continuing moderate growth of loans to the private sector. As regards the information under the second pillar, economic activity in the euro area remained subdued around the turn of the year, as suggested by recently published data and survey information. These indications are broadly in line with previous expectations which suggest a gradual increase, starting in the second half of the year, in real GDP growth rates to levels close to potential. Whereas the appreciation of the euro over recent months may contribute to dampening export growth to some extent, the price competitiveness of euro area companies remains favourable in a medium-term perspective and export growth should benefit from the expected recovery of the world economy. Therefore, recent exchange rate movements should not fundamentally affect the main scenario for the economic outlook. At the same time, several factors contributing to the general climate of uncertainty are still in place. In particular, investors remain risk averse against the background of ongoing geopolitical tension. Further turbulence in the oil markets could have a negative impact on economic activity throughout the world and, thereby, also on euro area employment. These concerns are also weighing on consumer confidence. Finally, the accumulated macroeconomic imbalances give rise to uncertainty about the strength of the recovery in other major economies. Taken together, there remain downside risks to the outlook for euro area economic activity. Considering price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation decreased to 2.1% in January 2003, from 2.3% in the previous month. As usual, these estimates are subject to uncertainty and there is no precise breakdown available as yet. However, it appears that compensating factors played a role: on the one hand, there was upward pressure from the recent hike in oil prices and from various increases in indirect taxes and administered prices at the beginning of 2003; on the other hand, the strengthening of the euro and benign base effects are dampening consumer price increases. These two latter factors should also help to further reduce annual rates of HICP inflation over the next few months. However, given the high volatility in oil markets, short-term forecasts for HICP inflation are currently subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty. Beyond the immediate future, the gradual pass-through of the appreciation of the euro, together with the expected moderate improvement in economic growth, should reduce inflationary pressures. The most likely outcome remains that inflation will fall and eventually stabilise at a level below 2% in the course of 2003. A major condition for price stability to also prevail in the medium term will be moderate wage developments. Wage moderation would also help improve the prospects for economic growth and further employment creation. It is therefore of particular importance that the upward trend in wage growth finally comes to a halt. However, the indications for this are still mixed, despite weak economic activity throughout last year. As for fiscal policy, the framework laid down in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact limits the risk of fiscal imbalances occurring, and therefore contributes significantly to favourable financing conditions for the private sector. At the same time, it allows an appropriate medium-term orientation of fiscal policy which fosters confidence and thereby growth. In order to fully reap the benefits of this framework, it is important that countries respect its objectives and implement appropriate consolidation plans where needed. Hence, the commitments made in the stability programmes and the requests to further improve fiscal positions, as subsequently agreed in the ECOFIN Council, must be met in full. These benefits would be magnified if the underlying policy measures were part of a comprehensive reform strategy to support economic growth. It is, in fact, the implementation of structural reforms at the micro level that ultimately raises the production potential, improves flexibility in the economy and makes the euro area more resilient to external shocks. Clearly, lack of progress in structural reform is one of the key factors currently hampering a recovery in confidence. Therefore, the Governing Council welcomes a recent communication by the Commission on the implementation of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. It emphasises the need to step up the pace of labour market reform to achieve the Lisbon objectives, to fully implement the Internal Market and to enhance competition in product markets as well as to foster capital market integration, entrepreneurship, a knowledge-based economy, and research and development. We fully share the Commission's assessment that policy inertia and backtracking are widespread. Against this background, renewed momentum in the process of structural reform will be crucial to foster confidence among consumers and investors. The impediments to cutting rates at this moment are the big uncertainties that still surround the figures that you mentioned. The uncertainties relating to oil prices, the geopolitical uncertainties and, well, let me say this: we were afraid that if one were to cut, at this moment, it would be a drop that would drown in the sea of uncertainties. On the first I will not comment. All I can say is that I have written my usual letter to Mr. Solana, requesting him to set in motion the process of appointing or nominating a successor to both Ms. Hämäläinen and me. That is all I can say about this at this moment. A special study on ERM is not on the cards at this moment. We know enough about ERM II. What we do know is that, at the ECOFIN, in the course of the coming months, ministers intend to pay some attention to the functioning of ERM II in relation to the accession of ten new members to the European Union. And upon accession these new members will, by Treaty, agree that the exchange rate is a matter of common interest, as Treaty language says. Therefore, we are contemplating this issue as well, rather than studying it. We have had enough studies, I believe. Well, as I have learned – as have you, I believe – on foreign exchange interventions I will keep my mouth shut, so I will say nothing about it. On the first, the geopolitical situation is one of the factors of grave and great uncertainty in the world. I would not go as far as your suggestion might imply, that that uncertainty would have to be out of the way before we could do anything. We can do anything we want, whenever we want. Well it is a not a matter of concern. First of all, the euro has for some weeks now been fluctuating around a level against the dollar of around 1.08, which is still slightly below the average level of the euro in the two years preceding the introduction of the euro. So it still reflects, we think, a healthy competitive position which has not been undermined by the recent nominal appreciation. On the latter, highly political question, we have not considered that. I am reporting here on the outcome of the Governing Council's considerations so I cannot comment on that either. On the first part we have, internally in the ECB, viewed various scenarios where you have to make assumptions: if there is a war, how long will it last? What will the repercussions be? But that was not even ripe enough, may I say, to present to the Governing Council, let alone to you. No, because you have to consider various alternatives if there is to be a war. You have to consider the alternative that there will be no war. The alternative that it will be a very short war. The alternative that it will be a prolonged war. All these hypothetical things, we all of course keep thinking about them. But to take this into consideration when today making decisions on interest rates would be to go too far. Volatility is always bad. And we prefer stability to volatility. But I would emphasise that the behaviour of the exchange rate over recent months has not been all that volatile. Effectively, the movements were quite limited. The largest movement we have seen was from the beginning of Mr. Powell's speech and towards the end of Mr. Powell's speech yesterday. Towards the end of the speech the euro was back to where it was at the beginning of the speech. But that is the largest amount of volatility we have seen in many weeks and therefore, neither the speed and certainly not the degree of so-called ""volatility"" – which was not much – is a cause of concern for us. Turning to the downside risks, we already took these into account in our decision to lower interest rates by 50 basis points in December. We publicly said that this step in December was somewhat larger than one could have otherwise anticipated, because of the downside risks we saw emerging then. Those downside risks have certainly not disappeared since then. I am inclined to say they have been exacerbated over recent months. So they are still there but they were not unexpected. Our so-called baseline scenario, which we presented in December, is still unchanged. The risks to the downside have increased. We will have new forecasts internally in the course of this spring. And I will not be surprised if they have to be slightly revised downwards. But we are not certain yet. For the time being, we stick to our main scenario, which is that we will have a moderate resumption of growth especially in the course of the second half of this year and that we will be at, or close to, the potential rate of growth towards the end of this year. I do not like the expression ""bias in the monetary policy"". But you can read from my Introductory Statement that whereas, on the one hand, I repeated what I said last month that the monetary policy stance is appropriate, I also added the words ""that for the time being"" we still assume that the high degree of uncertainty will decline in the course of this year. From that, you can infer some increased uncertainty also on our side. To say that things have fundamentally changed, we need more fundamental evidence and we need more time to assess. What is a curious thing, let me put it that way, is that – when in the past there was geopolitical uncertainty as we now euphemistically call it – the dollar was the ""safe haven"" for the world. Now, it weighs on the dollar rather than boosts it. And that is the difference from past experience. It would go beyond a responsible answer if I already drew conclusions from that in the direction of ""safe haven"" functions. But what we do see is that there is an increased, I am also inclined to use the word ""appreciation"", an increased ""value judgement"" on the part of many investors in the world, including central banks, to regard the euro as an attractive alternative to invest your funds in as compared with other currencies. Well, I do not like to answer speculative or hypothetical questions. So far, it is not a danger. It is having – over time – a helpful effect to keep inflation down or to contain inflationary pressures. And so far it has not undermined the competitive position of Europe and the direction, of course, in which the exchange rates are moving are a help in correcting the major imbalances that exist worldwide. Last question, yes, that is still the case. And we have to reckon with the effect that it takes a lot longer for exchange rate movements to work their way through into domestic price developments than it takes oil price increases to work their way into domestic price rises. So the time lags between the two are significantly different and the impact of the recent appreciation in the value of the euro, let us say since 1 January, still has to work its way through. But it will work its way through into further domestic price developments. Question (translation): What is your reaction to the criticism by ministers of the rotation model suggested by the Governing Council? Secondly, what is the state of the verification of the strategy? When will the result be published? Maybe in June when you publish your half-yearly report? And a general question on the projections: the experts will start work in March, but the previous assumptions were USD 0.99 as the euro exchange rate, an oil price of USD 26 and an interest rate of 3.25%. What is the current state of your assessment with regard to the old projections and the value of publishing such outdated projections? To the critics of the rotation model that we unanimously agreed on in the Governing Council and that we have presented to the European Council in the composition of heads of state and government, well I am almost inclined to say I still have to meet someone, including myself, who is unconditionally happy with the outcome. But, as you know, we had to meet quite a number of criteria to make the new system robust, transparent and simple... and it is not simple, after all. You cannot fulfil all these conditions simultaneously. But we did preserve a few very important principles. First, the rotation model only relates to the frequency with which Member States or individuals in the Governing Council take part in the vote, if there is a vote. Second, for the vote itself, we maintained the principle of one man, one vote. That for us was of extreme importance. Now I am also very happy to say that, if I listen to the criticisms, I hear them coming equally from large and small countries. Had it been one-sided then I would have been concerned, but now that it comes from all sides, I think that that helps me. And I challenge anyone – and that includes all ministers – to come up with a model that is as transparent, as equitable and as simple as the one we have come up with. And therefore my indications are that, in the end, our proposal is very likely to prevail. We have started with our staff – by which I mean the staff of the ECB and all NCBs – to undertake an evaluation of our monetary policy strategy. As I have indicated, it is about time, after five years of experience with the current strategy. And I can in no way indicate what the outcome of that evaluation is ultimately going to be. As far as the timetable is concerned, I read somewhere that it will be decided whilst I was still President and it would be published on the first day of the new President's term of office. That was news to me: there is no such timetable. We think, in the Governing Council, that we will complete this evaluation in the course of the spring, and as soon as we have completed it we will publish it. As for the projections, I cannot say at the moment: the issue is in full swing at staff level and, of course, the underlying assumptions have to be changed. The exchange rate has changed and interest rates have changed since the last projections were made. Of course these factors will be taken into account, but precisely how and how much, it is impossible for me to answer that at this point. Well, maybe you have already given the answer yourself. If the question is ""have you been in contact"", the answer is ""yes"". And not only today. And why did they come to different conclusions? They are a different economy. And I explained why we came to the conclusions as we did. I am not going to comment on the conclusions that another major central bank reached in quite a different situation. But if I may make one comment, I would like to emphasise that our main interest rates are currently at 2ï¿½%. They brought theirs down today from 4 to 3ï¿½%. And that is something of a difference as well. I wish as little uncertainty as possible. But then, of course, I regret that this process in general terms is dragging on for such a long time. That is never good. Not for the person, not for the institutions that he represents, not for the issues that he and I are concerned with, or are busy working on. For that reason I would hope that this long drawn-out process will be over sooner rather than later. That is a true statement. Very strong. Yes, I will have a chance to discuss those matters. Not only at the next G7 meeting but already next Sunday, when all the Asian governors meet with some governors from other continents in Sydney in Australia. Well, as you know, our mandate, our aim, is to keep inflation below 2% but above 0%. Now, in the Japanese case you are very close to 0%. Therefore, I can imagine that both the fiscal and the monetary authorities are thinking about means to get a little bit further away from that zero inflation environment, which is close to deflation. Because if you consider more radical approaches, that basically would mean that the decision-making body, or the voting body, would be even smaller than it is today. Today, it consists of 18 governors – the Governing Council, that is – all representing not their countries but being there in a personal capacity. If, as the Treaty foresees, all European Union members were members of the euro area, that would take it to 21. To go to a smaller number would mean excluding some participants from taking part in the vote. Some countries also. Now, you could do that. But you do not become a member of a union with the prospect of having nothing to say about it. Now, our proposal does not exclude anybody from taking part in the discussions. Everybody is entitled to take part in the discussions on monetary policy and all the other kinds of issues which we have to deal with. I admit that, on the voting, there is something that relates to the size of the countries participating. And if you now expand the Governing Council by at least ten members, and in the Nice Treaty it is counted on that there might be 12 extra members, which would then be 27, plus six of the Executive Board, which makes 33. In that case, there was a legitimate fear on behalf of especially the larger countries, that they could easily – also on monetary policy – be outvoted by a majority representing – in aggregate terms – less than 3-4% of the enlarged euro area GDP. That was a legitimate fear. The solution applies only to the voting frequency and not to the discussion participation, which is free for all. So the influence is there. And the voting itself remains ""one man, one vote"" without regard to nationality. Papademos: I think you explained this very well. Perhaps I should add two points. As you mentioned earlier, the relative complexity of the model reflects the fact that it aimed to be compatible with a number of criteria. And it primarily reflects the new structure, the representativeness principle. And another point, which you also touched upon, is that it is often not realised that the voting in the Governing Council relates not only to issues of monetary policy but also to various other issues for which representation of the national central banks within a framework similar to the present one is warranted. For example, payment systems. This is one of the most important ones. Banknote production. Papademos: The decisions relate to the division of labour between the ECB and the NCBs. Minimum reserve requirements, all instruments, all technical requirements for executing monetary policy. "
2003-01-09,Duisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council, Mr. Christodoulakis, and Commissioner Solbes. We have reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments and updated our assessment in light of the new information available. Overall, we consider that the outlook for price stability in the medium term has not changed since our decision of 5 December to reduce the key ECB interest rates. We judge the current monetary policy stance appropriate to maintain a favourable outlook for price stability in the medium term. Hence, we have decided to keep our key rates unchanged. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.1% for the period from September to November 2002, unchanged from the period from August to October 2002. A strong preference of investors for liquid and secure assets, in an environment of continued financial market, economic and geopolitical uncertainty, remains a major driving force behind the strong monetary dynamics. Furthermore, the low level of interest rates prevailing in the euro area makes the holding of monetary assets relatively attractive. As a result of the pace of monetary growth, liquidity in the euro area is ample. However, at the current juncture, given that the portfolio shifts due to economic and financial uncertainty may be a temporary phenomenon, and in light of the sluggish economic growth, the excess liquidity is deemed unlikely to translate into inflationary pressures. The continued decline in the growth of loans to the private sector up to November 2002 supports this assessment. Turning to the second pillar, the outlook for economic activity in the euro area has remained broadly unchanged. As recently published survey data indicate, economic growth is likely to have remained subdued at the end of last year. For 2003, a gradual increase in real GDP growth rates to levels close to potential later in the year remains the main scenario, provided that the factors currently contributing to the general climate of uncertainty gradually unwind. Although some stabilisation in financial markets has been observed over the past couple of months, investors continue to perceive a high level of uncertainty. At the same time, there are still risks relating to a disorderly adjustment of the past accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances, especially outside the euro area. In addition, geopolitical tensions continue to weigh adversely on confidence. Indeed, the increase in oil prices over the past few weeks – besides being influenced by temporary supply constraints – reflects the risk of more acute tensions in oil markets in the future, which, in turn, would have a negative impact on the prospects for economic activity worldwide. There are still, therefore, downside risks to the outlook for economic activity in the euro area, although the current low level of interest rates should help to counterbalance these. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in December 2002, unchanged from November 2002. Due to the increase in oil prices, some renewed upward pressure on consumer prices is likely to have emerged around the turn of the year, and this pressure may have been reinforced by effects stemming from various increases in indirect taxes and administered prices which became effective at the beginning of 2003. At the same time, base effects – relating mainly to unprocessed food prices but, in part, also originating from past increases in services prices – will help to reduce annual HICP inflation figures in early 2003. Furthermore, the direct effects of the recent appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro on import prices and their gradual passthrough to the euro area economy should contribute to dampening consumer price inflation. The current subdued pace of economic growth should also contain inflationary pressures. While the significant risks surrounding oil price developments make any short-term prediction difficult at this stage, the most likely outcome remains that inflation will stabilise in the course of 2003 at a level below 2%. A major condition for this outlook for inflation to materialise will be moderate wage developments. Reflecting the rigidities prevailing in euro area labour markets, wage growth remained on an upward trend until early 2002, despite the weakening of economic activity. It is not yet clear whether this trend has come to a halt. Wage moderation is crucial for maintaining price stability. Furthermore, it would help to improve the prospects for economic and employment growth. An important contribution to strengthening growth prospects in the euro area should also come from fiscal and structural policies. Determined reform efforts are needed in these policy areas to increase incentives for investment and employment creation in the euro area. Regarding fiscal policy, countries with remaining fiscal imbalances have committed themselves to implement consolidation plans in order to reach budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus in the medium term. As part of this process, governments should put emphasis on growth-oriented consolidation policies that strengthen the productive forces of the economy. Such policies are likely to be most effective when integrated into a comprehensive reform strategy based on structural retrenchment in spending. The fiscal policy framework, as laid down in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, provides a sound basis for limiting the risk of fiscal imbalances occurring. At the same time, it preserves an appropriate medium-term orientation for fiscal policy, based on realistic assumptions regarding economic developments. The Governing Council supports the steps taken by the Commission to preserve the functioning of the framework, including the implementation of excessive deficit procedures and the issuing of early warnings, where required. Turning to structural reforms, it is essential that governments intensify their efforts to expand the euro area's potential for non-inflationary growth and to reduce its high level of unemployment. The need for further progress in this field is particularly evident in a phase when the euro area economy has to adapt to a sequence of adverse shocks. Indeed, such reforms, which should aim to reduce rigidities in labour and goods markets, could significantly enhance the degree of resilience of economic activity to such shocks, both in the euro area as a whole and in its regions. Renewed momentum in the process of structural reform will be important to foster confidence among consumers and investors in long-term growth and employment opportunities in the euro area. This, in turn, should also have a positive effect on spending and investment decisions in the short and medium term. We are now at your disposal for questions. On the first question, of course, the recent further appreciation of the euro is, in part, equivalent to a monetary ""tightening"". Apart from that, the exchange rate remains one of our important indicators which we take into account in assessing the risks to price stability when taking the overall decision, as we did today, to establish the monetary policy stance. The exchange rate counts, but it is not a one-for-one exchange in monetary policy measures and exchange rate developments, as you can well imagine and as you also well know. As regards your second question, it is not our expectation that there will be a contraction. We do expect very moderate growth and a slow resumption of growth throughout the year, including the first quarter. Question (translation): After the introduction of the euro the share of the euro in the reserves of all national central banks worldwide fell to 11%. How long do you think it will take until this is increased in euro and what sort of marketing efforts are you making so that the share of the euro in the worldwide reserves of central banks increases to euro holdings of up to maybe 40%. And a second question: when you were head of the Dutch central bank you always had 50% of the reserves in US dollars and 50% in Deutsche Mark and related currencies. Now just a question to you personally, Mr how do you invest? Do you invest in euro or in dollars, or do you invest in shares or in bonds? I would be very interested to hear your own personal point of view. I am in the happy circumstance that I do not have reserves. The share of the euro in worldwide reserves was – we do not have the figures for 2002 yet – around 13% at the end of 2001. And that was the same as the sum total of what we now call the legacy currencies, i.e. the Deutsche Mark, the French franc etc., represented in the reserves of third countries in the times before the euro. I have the impression that in the course of 2002 there has been a movement to invest more, relatively speaking, in euro, but I do not have the figures yet. The second part of your question was what is our strategy to increase that. The answer to that is that we are more or less indifferent; it is not our aim to have the world invest more in official reserves in euro. We will see what market forces achieve, but it is to be expected, to the extent that the international use of the euro increases – and it is a slow process – that trade between the euro area and the rest of the world will increasingly be quoted and paid in euro, and that the need for the rest of the world to hold more of its reserves in euro will increase. But that is indeed a very slow process that may take decades. Well, first of all, I would not qualify the attitude of the Commission as being ""lenient"", as you put it. The Commission has now started the excessive deficit procedure, and rightly so. The German Government has accepted that, and rightly so. Now, if, in the future, the underlying assumption were disqualified, in other words growth were less than currently officially anticipated – that is less than 1ï¿½% – what attitude the Commission would then take remains to be seen. I would emphasise that it is the Commission which is the guardian of the Stability and Growth Pact, and the ECB plays no role, but – looking at our record in the past – we have at all times had good reason to support strongly any action that the Commission did. I don't know whether it is appropriately valued, to take your last question first. I welcome the recent appreciation of the euro as a contributing force to keeping inflation under control. On the other hand, the recent further appreciation of the euro, as I believe Mr. Welteke has also said yesterday or today, has no negative impact on the competitive position of Europe vis-à-vis the rest of the world. Now to the first question. The risks to the downside have increased somewhat, due mainly to, may I call it, the lack of the disappearance of uncertainty that is prevailing. We had hoped that this uncertainty would gradually disappear and that is the main cause for concern. Our outlook for the medium term remained unchanged, despite what you have said about very recent figures. But the uncertainty is still prevailing and it permeates and pervades the minds of consumers and investors alike. The only thing I am inclined to say, the only factor of stability that people are certain about, is the stability of our monetary policy stance and with it we hope to contribute to a resumption of economic growth and a restoration of confidence. Not frustrated, but disappointed. Oh yes. Hope for improvement, because in the end the people will not accept that there is not a greater impulse or drive for reform to bring down this high level of unemployment which we know has persisted for I do not know how many years. And if governments do not follow up on their original broad intentions as, for example, made known in the Lisbon declaration, so those governments who do not live up to that commitment will be punished, not by me but by the people. I expect so. We will be undertaking this evaluation in the course of the first half of this year. I can inform you that today I have written a letter to Mr. Solana, the Secretary-General of the European Council, asking him to set in motion the process of appointing successors to both Ms. Hämäläinen and myself. This is a pure formality, just as we did last year in the case of the departure of Vice-President Noyer. In this letter, I have repeated the sentence which I wrote in my letter to Prime Minister Aznar when he was the President of the European Council, in which I asked for my resignation by 9 July 2003 or at such time thereafter as the heads of state and government deemed to be in the interest of an orderly transition of the Presidency (of the ECB). Well, growth-oriented consolidation policies would mean, for example, that if you have to cut into expenditures it will be more growth-oriented if you cut into government consumption-oriented expenditures rather than into investment expenditures. That is one thing that is meant, and it is not simply Keynesian-type taxation measures that I am talking about. The last question I will not answer. I will not enter into any speculation about who will be my successor, as you can understand and as you undoubtedly anticipated. With regard to the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance, we were not so sure in December whether we could use the word. Now we are much surer that it is appropriate. We do see both upward and downward risks to inflation, and the lack of certainty, the lack of confidence and the slow movement of economic activity are helping to keep inflation down. Oil prices are doing the opposite. In the current circumstances our attitude is that we indeed regard this policy stance as ""appropriate"", and as far as the future is concerned it is ""wait and see"". "
